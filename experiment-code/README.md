# Notes on codebase

I've included the Lua files that were used to stringify and game state, and to send and receive agent actions.

These are found in the `mod` dir above. 

Unfortunately, I haven't found the time to package this into a proper mod that works with Steamodded, but please feel free to use
the files as a place to start if you would like!


All python code used to interact with the agents and record the outcomes of games is included.
