{"reasoning":"**Considering card options**\n\nI'm in a shop with $12, and I'm weighing my options. I can buy a Sun tarot card for $3 or a Rocket joker for $6, but I need to think: the Rocket joker would be a tough replacement for my existing strong scoring package of Odd Todd, Abstract, Mystic Summit, Acrobat, and Hanging Chad. I need to ensure I'm making a valuable decision, especially since two celestial packs are $4 each and could impact my strategy. Plus, there's the Telescope aspect to consider regarding my strongest combinations.\n**Evaluating celestial packs**\n\nI'm considering how celestial packs could enhance my game by offering planets like Jupiter, which could help boost my hand. I know the planets correspond to specific poker hands: Mercury for a pair, Venus for three of a kind, and so on. If I buy a pack, I can select up to three planet cards, ensuring at least one fits my strongest hand. Investing in these packs now seems like a solid strategy to upgrade my two pair and scale my chips effectively!\n**Weighing tarot and planet upgrades**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to get the Sun tarot card, which allows me to convert up to three selected cards to hearts for a potential flush or straight flush. However, my current deck seems more focused on odd ranks, so maybe the Sun isn't crucial unless I get hearts synergy. I might prioritize upgrading my planets through booster packs. With $12, I can buy two packs for $8, leaving $4 for the Sun. I should start by buying the first booster pack!\n**Finalizing the buy strategy**\n\nI'll go ahead with buying booster pack 1! I’m thinking about whether I should consider rerolling the shop, but since I have the Telescope, the celestial packs seem like a good choice. I also don’t know what the next boss might be, so it’s crucial to prepare by increasing my hand levels. In this case, buying the booster pack feels like the right decision to enhance my chances!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
