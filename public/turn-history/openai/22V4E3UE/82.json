{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI need to think about how to use my cards effectively, especially when it comes to discarding. Using discards may allow me to draw new cards, but I want to protect my pairs of 8s. My hand currently has 8 cards, and after discarding up to 5, I can draw that many back. I might also consider keeping a 7 and an Ace for my strategy. I need to ensure I hold onto both 8s until the final hand.\n**Analyzing discard strategy**\n\nIt looks like our previous reasoning relied on a steel card multiplier, but that's no longer in play. I need to confirm if there's any multiplier in hand, and it seems there isn't. Our total should still exceed 10k, ideally reaching 12.5k. Now, we're at the start of the round with 4 hands and 2 discards. I wonder if we should discard now to hunt for more 8s or scoring opportunities. It might be better to discard non-8 cards, but I'm cautious about the risks involved. Since our pair is already solid, maybe we can skip the fishing and hold steady.\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI know I need to use both discards eventually. I could save them for closer to the final, but if I do that, Mystic won’t activate until I have 0 discards. If I discard now, I can clear out bad cards while hunting for more 8s. Maybe it’s best to use discards right before the final round to draw another 8 while keeping my pair intact. However, drawing new cards could lead to losing low cards and getting high combos. I could play one-card high card hands to keep scoring minimal.\n**Calculating scoring nuances**\n\nI need to consider that scoring involves base chips and multipliers from jokers. Even a high card will have a base of 5 chips with a multiplier of 1. Then there’s the Abstract multiplier of +12, leading to a total multiplier of 13. Playing a card might give an additional chip value ranging from 2 to 11, plus Odd Todd adds +31 if it’s odd. This results in about 100-600 chips, which is pretty low. If I play a single low even card, like a 2 or 4, it’ll just score based on that. I might also consider playing a 7 or Ace since Odd Todd adds +31, but it'll still be moderate. I think I'll plan to play the high card with 2C, but I need to remember that the boss effect applies to the first hand drawn face down.\n**Clarifying card effects and strategy**\n\nIt seems the initial effect already resolved since all cards are now face-up, possibly due to discarded face-down cards. For our next action, we want to preserve our 8s. I should play a very low card, like 4C, which would score as high card for 9 chips since that's base 5 plus 4. The total chips would be 117. We can only play one card, consuming one hand and leaving three remaining. After playing 4C, we'll draw a replacement card, but we'll still have 2 eights. \n\nSince order matters for the independent jokers, I believe I should keep the current arrangement, with Odd Todd first. Although an early win might cut my Acrobat's effect, it’s fine since we only need 10k. I’ll hold off on discarding for now and proceed with the action to play 4C at position 8, estimating 117 chips.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [8]"}
