{"reasoning":"**Calculating card strategy**\n\nI’m realizing that I played five hearts, which are discarded but still remain in the deck. Between hands, those cards are drawn again. In this game, we actually play multiple hands and draw new cards after each. For the boss, I might need a flush, but drawing five hearts increases my odds with an enlarged hand size from Turtle Bean. However, I could also opt for a pair, which is easier to make.\n**Assessing discard strategy**\n\nI’m trying to figure out the number of discards I might have, considering that at ante2 big blind, we had four hands with four discards. I think the default remains three, but it could vary. The banner gives me an additional 30 chips for each remaining discard at the scoring time. Assuming I have three discards, that’s a bonus of 90 chips. For a pair, I need to calculate the total chips before applying multipliers.\n**Calculating chip potential**\n\nI’m calculating multipliers and total chips for my strategy. It looks like the base for my pair is 3, and with Abstract adding 12, that gives me a total multiplier of 15. If I multiply my chips (199) by that, I get 2985, which is impressive! Even without Odd Todd, I'm still looking at 2025 chips with just the basics. However, the boss restricts to one hand type, so I think a pair is my safest bet. It’s easier than trying for a straight, even with the right boosts.\n**Strategizing card types**\n\nI’m thinking long-term about my strategy; a flush might be the plan, but I don’t think I want to rely on Jupiter. I could consider straights since I already have a Straight Flush at level 2. The boss restricts to one hand type, so pairs or two pairs might be more consistent. Mercury enhances pairs, which I’ll use often. Leveling my straight could give bigger multipliers and chips, but I might not play it as often. A pair-focused build with Mercury boosting my chips sounds promising!\n**Evaluating card multipliers**\n\nI’m noticing that my base multiplier is increasing by 1, plus with Abstract adding 12, my total multiplier is now 16, which is great! Uranus would level my two pair, increasing it to 60 chips at multiplier 4, which is nice. While two pairs could be easier with a larger hand size, they require two pairs to be successful, making them less consistent. I think I'll stick with Mercury since it seems more reliable. So, my next action will be to select pack_card_position 1 for Mercury.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
