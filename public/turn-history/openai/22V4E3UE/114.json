{"reasoning":"**Calculating final hand scoring**\n\nFor the final hand, I need something strong, like Two Pair or better. I already have a pair of Aces, so I’m looking for a second pair with ranks of 9, 7, 3, or 5 to maximize my score with Odd Todd. Even if the second pair's rank is even, it might still score decently. I’ll use the scoring formula to compute potential chips from the hand type, scoring cards, and enhancements. Plus, there are multipliers to consider from Abstract and Mystic.\n**Estimating final hand multipliers**\n\nI need to apply a multiplier of 3 to the final hand with Acrobat x3, so my final hand multiplier will be calculated as (base mult + 15 + 15 + possibly lucky) times 3. For a Two Pair, the base multiplier is 5, which gives me (5 + 30) = 35 x 3 = 105. I want to ensure my chip total multiplied by 105 is enough to reach 22,000. I estimate needing around 210 chips or more in my final hand to win, which seems feasible with a strong Two Pair. Let’s calculate those chips!\n**Calculating Odd Todd multipliers**\n\nFor Odd Todd, the trigger activates with Aces, giving me a total of 184 chips. However, that yields only 19,320 chips when multiplied by the final hand multiplier of 105, which is short of the 21,760 I need. I could still score with a pair instead of two pairs. If I use AA with a second pair of 9’s, I get 244, leading to 25,620 chips—plenty to win! The calculations also work with second pairs of 7's or 3's, giving sufficient totals as well.\n**Exploring second pair options**\n\nIf the second pair is 5s, the total would be 236, yielding around 24,780 chips, which is decent. With kings, since they don't trigger Odd Todd, I'd get 184 chips total—same as queens—not enough. With a second pair of 2s, the total drops to 17,640, still insufficient. Ideally, I need 3s, 5s, 7s, or 9s. Alternatively, I could aim for a full house with Aces and 3s, which brings a nice total of 27,948 chips—now that’s a winner!\n**Planning the final hand strategy**\n\nI need three of a kind with Aces, but I only have two, so I could try to draw another one. However, aiming for a Two Pair seems easier. I’ll use my discards to chase either a second pair or possibly trip Aces. I should keep the Aces and the 3♥. I must ensure no discards are left for the final hand and can play small hands while preserving key cards. I’ll plan to discard weaker cards like K♠ and 8♣, aiming to draw better options for a strong finish!\n**Strategizing final hands**\n\nI need to use my second discard before the final play, and I have three hands left. Winning with the final hand is crucial since if I win early, I might miss out on using Acrobat's bonus, which only triggers on the final hand. I’m aiming for a two pair of Aces and a 9, but I need to ensure I avoid overscoring early. I’ll play two low hands to cycle while preserving strong cards, discarding less useful ones, and improving my chances for a solid final round!\n**Evaluating scoring strategies**\n\nI’m pondering how debuffed cards interact with scoring. If a debuffed card doesn’t score chips, does it trigger any joker effects? It seems safer to avoid spades in scoring hands to prevent losses. I need to keep my 2♣ for potential benefits later, especially for the planet card, so I shouldn’t play it. I’ll discard some cards now to cycle fresh options, and aim to keep my aces, 3, and 2♣ intact for the final hand. I’ll play low value hands to avoid accidental wins while refreshing my draw!\n**Planning discards for cycling**\n\nI’ve got two hands left before the final one, and I want to avoid creating pairs or trips. If I do end up making a pair, it’s okay as long as I don’t surpass 22,000 chips. My plan is to discard non-key cards to cycle through, so I’ll get rid of cards 1, 3, 5, and 6. I could keep other cards for the final hand but will focus on maximizing my draw chances instead. Let’s proceed with the discards!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6]"}
