{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m looking at the options in the game. The banner gives me +30 chips for discarding jokers, which is still beneficial. We also have the Lovers consumable that can create a wild card but can only be used during a round where I have a hand, so I can't use it right now. I should avoid hearts for the boss, but if I have too many, it becomes tricky. Since the ante is just 1 and I'm targeting 600, I think it’s achievable. Keeping Lusty for later seems wise since selling it gives $2, which could help in the shop, but selling before facing the boss might reduce its potential multiplier later. If I win against the boss, I could earn extra money from rewards. It feels best to not sell Lusty right now, especially as it could still be useful in early game scenarios.\n**Playing the boss round**\n\nI’m getting ready to play the boss. I need to remember that the order of jokers is important since their effects apply from left to right. The banner gives me +30 chips for remaining discards, and it's independent during that stage, which is good to note. Lusty is part of the 'on scored' stage, and while the order of independent effects doesn’t matter much here, it could if I had multiple 'on scored' items. So, my next action is to play the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
