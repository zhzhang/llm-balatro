{"reasoning":"**Considering game progression**\n\nI think we've just finished the ante3 boss and now we’re moving into ante4. It feels like we’re making good progress! SHOP might be a place to get upgrades, or is it a safe zone? I’m curious about what new challenges await in ante4. Let’s hope we’re well-prepared after this victory! I really want to optimize my strategy for what’s coming next.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’ve got $10 and all joker slots filled, which is great! I'm considering the Sly Joker that adds chips if I get a pair, and the Square Joker that scales chips with exactly 4 cards. I’ve noticed that I'm playing two pairs often, which is helpful. Right now, our strategy involves keeping our discards for a chip advantage. The Turtle Bean adds to hand size but decreases each round. Should I buy the Tarot Merchant, or focus on getting a more favorable hand from celestial packs?\n**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nThe Tarot Merchant could help me see more tarot cards, but spending all my cash might limit my interest. I think the interest is capped around $5 per $25, which complicates things a bit. If I buy the Tarot Merchant for $10, I won’t have any cash left, which might affect my interest in the next rounds. Alternatively, there’s the $4 Spectral pack, which could offer strong cards like immolate or wraith. I need to consider whether my current jokers are optimal and think about replacing the Turtle Bean soon, since it's decaying.\n**Weighing Joker options**\n\nThe Sly Joker offers +50 chips whenever I have a pair, which seems useful but not huge. The Square Joker, on the other hand, has the potential to scale if I consistently play with exactly 4 cards. If I can manage to play hands with 4 cards, especially with two pairs or pairs, it gives an extra +4 chips each time. That sounds promising for long-term scaling! The Square Joker seems like a solid option for maximizing my score.\n**Deciding on Joker Strategies**\n\nRight now, I’m using Turtle Bean for extra hand size, but it’s going to reach 0 soon, which could waste a slot. Selling it for $4 sounds smart, especially since I could buy the Square Joker. After that, I’ll have $10 left. I’m contemplating whether to go for the Spectral pack or the Tarot Merchant, but I need to keep some cash for interest.\n\nSelling Turtle Bean doesn’t cost anything, and I think it’s best to do that first to gain money and a slot. Buying the Square Joker afterward seems like a great plan!\n**Making the sell decision**\n\nIf I keep Turtle Bean in the shop, it’s likely to drop to 0 next round while still taking up a slot. It’ll become worthless then! Selling it now seems smarter, especially since I can grab the Square Joker for scaling. Even though the Gift Card could increase sell values if I wait a round, I don’t want to risk missing out on Square's benefits. So, the action is to sell Turtle Bean. I need to output this in JSON format as: `{\"action\": \"sell_joker\", \"positions\": [2]}`.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
