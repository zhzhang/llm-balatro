{"reasoning":"**Calculating intended actions**\n\nIn the independent category, I realize that order matters mainly when dealing with multiplication, but addition remains commutative, which shouldn’t require any reordering. Now, I need to select the action to play the round and respond with JSON, including the intended hand type—let's set that to \"pair.\" I estimate the chips might exceed 1600 since pairs at level 3 have a base of 40 chips. Each card in the pair also contributes to the total based on its rank, which I'll factor in.\n**Calculating chip totals**\n\nIf I have a pair of Aces, that gives me about +22 chips, resulting in a total of approximately 62 chips. Then Odd Todd adds +31 chips for each odd-ranked card played, so that's another +62 for the Aces. Moreover, with a Banner that gives +30 chips for each remaining discard—starting with likely 3 discards—I’ll add 90 chips. All in all, that brings my total chips to around 214, which is multiplied to yield a substantial score. Even with lower pairs, I still seem to meet the targets, though fewer discards could lower the total.\n**Choosing the strategy**\n\nI realize that the boss requires using only one hand type throughout the round, which leads me to think that employing a pair strategy could be effective for a one-shot approach. This makes it clear that I should move ahead and select the action to play the round. Keeping things straightforward and consistent seems crucial here, so I'll follow through with that plan. Let’s get started!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
