{"reasoning":"**Weighing options in gameplay**\n\nI’m facing a decision at ante2 big blind, needing 1200. I could play to earn $4 and shop before the boss, or skip for D6 tag rerolls at $0, but that means no shopping until after the boss. Playing big earns immediate money, which may be crucial before the boss. Skipping could lead to a strong tag but puts me at risk against the boss without proper strength. Can I pass the boss without shopping first? That’s the key question!\n**Evaluating strategic choices**\n\nSkipping the big blind grants a tag for the next shop after the boss, but I might need improvements now. Playing big helps earn money and allows access to the shop. The $4 now feels more valuable than waiting for a D6 tag. If I win, I could still buy rerolls with the $4 plus remaining hands. The risk seems manageable since I can beat the big blind with 3 hands at 400 each. So, playing seems like the best option!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
