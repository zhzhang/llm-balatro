{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the game and whether to skip the big and small bets. If I do that, I can go straight to the boss at ante1 with the starting deck that requires 600 chips. This might be doable without jokers, but I wonder if it’s risky due to the debuffed hearts. While the hearts don’t score, I can still form hands with them. Without jokers, I might need 2-3 strong hands to hit 600 chips in the boss round.\n**Weighing game options**\n\nI'm considering the implications of my hand. Even with debuffed hearts, non-debuffed cards still contribute chip values. If I play a flush with mostly debuffed hearts, it could hurt my score, but I can avoid hearts in my scoring hand. Skipping both blinds means missing out on $3 and $4, plus interest, leaving me with $4 for the boss. After beating the boss, I could shop with potential free items and tags. But there's a risk in beating the boss without jokers. Alternatively, I could play small and earn $3 to prepare for shopping.\n**Strategizing shop options**\n\nI realize that the shop comes after each round I win. If I play small and win, I can go to the shop. However, I want to consider getting a coupon to make that shop free, plus a rare tag for a free rare joker. If I opt for small first, I gain money and access to an early shop, but miss the coupon. Alternatively, I could skip small for the coupon, play big, and earn a $4 reward while still getting initial jokers and booster packs free. That's a powerful strategy!\n**Deciding on gameplay strategy**\n\nIt seems best to skip the small bet, which only gives 300 chips. Skipping means missing out on $3 and a shop, but it also gives me a coupon for the shop after playing big. This could be worthwhile. \n\nWhat if I skip big for a rare tag? That would give me a coupon and a rare joker, but I'd have to wait for the shop until after the boss round, which could be risky, yet I might still manage reaching 600 chips. Without jokers, I’d probably need about three strong hands to get there.\n**Finalizing strategy choice**\n\nTo reach the 600 chips I need, securing about three decent hands seems possible. If I skip the small blind and play big instead, I can access the shop before facing the boss, which might help me manage that situation better. The coupon tag makes this shop visit free, allowing me to pick some good jokers or booster packs. I realize that the shop will likely offer initial items for free. So, my best move is to skip the small blind this time. I'll opt for skip_round and prepare the action JSON.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
