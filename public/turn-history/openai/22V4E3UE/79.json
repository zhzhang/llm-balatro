{"reasoning":"**Reviewing card strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about how to manage face-down cards by discarding them to reveal new face-up options. Ideally, we can keep the steel card in hand to multiply our score by 1.5, as long as it's unplayed. Odd Todd gives +31 chips for scoring with odd ranks, which includes only A, 9, 7, 5, and 3—meaning 9♣ will also score that bonus. Our best hand seems to be Pair level 4, with additional scoring possibilities from the other combinations.\n**Calculating potential scores**\n\nWith my jokers, I can achieve a high multiplier: base multiplier plus Abstract's +12 and Mystic's +15 if I keep my discards at zero. Then, I consider putting in the Acrobat x3 in the final hand and the steel card's x1.5 bonus if I keep it in hand. If I play a pair of 8s, my potential chip total with different multipliers can reach over 10k. I can do this in one hand if it's the final. This is looking promising!\n**Clarifying hand strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about how the final hand relates to the round's last of four hands. The Acrobat triggers only on the last hand played, meaning I shouldn’t win early if I want to utilize that multiplier effectively. If I win before all hands are played, it might end the round prematurely. The Acrobat provides a x3 multiplier only when there’s one hand left. So, I need to ensure I play strategically to reach that 10k threshold while aiming for the best timing.\n**Exploring hand management**\n\nI’m considering whether I can win without using the Acrobat. My previous non-final hands scored around 3-7k, likely due to Odd Todd, though I’m realizing a full house scored 7722 without the Acrobat. It’s not entirely clear how my earlier rounds included Mystic or how I managed discards. To maximize my chances, I should use the first three hands for setup and manage my discards effectively. I can discard three times before my final play and set up for a strong last hand to aim for that 10k!\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI’m considering whether to discard now to improve my hand by potentially creating higher chip totals with odd cards. The pair of 8s and steel is already enough to hit 10k with the right multipliers. My strategy should involve discarding to play low-scoring hands first, keeping my 8s and steel for the final hand. I want to discard three unknown cards and possibly K and 9 to optimize my hand, focusing on keeping essential cards while maximizing potential for the final play. Using the Hierophant to enhance the 8s could further raise my chip total, too!\n**Deciding on enhancements and discards**\n\nI’m figuring out whether to use Hierophant to enhance my two 8s to Bonus Cards first. That seems like a powerful move. If I discard first, positions change, but if I enhance, those bonuses stay. I also consider using Death to duplicate a steel card, but would that impact my hand too much? I think the best approach is to enhance the 8s now and then discard my other cards to reveal new options. Keeping the two Bonus 8s and optimizing with the remaining discards seems like a solid plan!\n**Planning card plays**\n\nI can play small by selecting five random cards each time while keeping my bonus 8s and steels safe. I need to avoid playing those key cards to maintain my hand. With eight cards total, selecting up to five means I can still strategize effectively. Holding a few key cards reduces my options slightly, but it's manageable. I think I’ll proceed with using Hierophant to enhance my 8s now. I’ll execute that action!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,2,4]"}
