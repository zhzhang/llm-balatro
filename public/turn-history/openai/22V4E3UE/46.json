{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm in the shop with a chance to get a free Mars planet card and a free Standard Pack, and I have $2. I need to decide what to buy since Mars isn't our strategy, but it’s free, so I might as well take it to use or discard later. Buying Mars would take a consumable slot, but it looks like Mars is categorized as a shop card, not a consumable. I can buy that and then think about adding a card from the Standard Pack.\n**Considering consumable purchases**\n\nI'm thinking about buying a consumable card like a Tarot, Planet, or Spectral card from the card section, and using it immediately. This would avoid occupying a slot, but I can’t specifically target anything. Since Mars doesn’t require a target, I could use it right away to avoid wasting it, but I might prefer to hold onto it for possible selling later, probably for about $1. That’s not a lot, though. Using Mars doesn’t harm my strategy, so it makes sense to use it immediately. I need to figure out how to specify its position correctly when using the command.\n**Planning consumable use**\n\nIn our shop, there’s only the Mars card at position 1. For both buying and using the card immediately, I’ll choose the buy_and_use_consumable command with position 1. This will level my Four of a Kind from level 1 to level 2, giving me a +3 multiplier and +30 chips! So, my new totals will be 90 chips and a multiplier of 10. That sounds good! I’ll also look to open the free Standard Pack to potentially add some unique cards for Odd Todd, like A, 9, 7, 5, or 3. I’ll have to wait to see what options I get from the pack.\n**Making the purchase decision**\n\nI'm deciding to buy the booster, but it might be smarter to use the Mars card first since it’s likely more beneficial at this point. I also considered rerolling, but it costs 5, which I can’t spend right now. So, I’ll go ahead with the buy_and_use_consumable command for Mars now. That feels like the right move, and I’m excited to see how it helps with my strategy!\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
