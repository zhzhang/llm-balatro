{"reasoning":"**Considering card game strategy**\n\nI'm realizing that we can't skip the blind select boss and need to play a round. Order is important, especially with our jokers. Odd Todd triggers when scored. It seems that Abstract and Mystic are independent, but how they trigger depends on the discard count. To maximize our setup, I think placing them as Abstract, Mystic, and then Acrobat works best. I need to make sure you've thought about using consumables before the first draw too!\n**Planning strategy around boss effect**\n\nI'm considering how the boss effect makes the first hand drawn face down, which complicates our choices since we won't see the cards to pick from. Maybe using Hierophant or Death in this round is risky without knowing targets. I could discard the whole first hand to reveal new cards, which should be face-up afterward. However, Mystic Summit wants 0 discards to maximize bonuses, so preserving my discards might be vital for scoring. I need to be strategic!\n**Evaluating discards and strategy**\n\nIf we need to use all discards, I might have to discard early to play effectively. I’m thinking back to earlier rounds where there were usually two discards. Using all of them could set us up for Mystic. The boss might force a discard anyway, which could actually help. For my first action, I should consider discarding all five cards to reshape my hand. I want to hit that last hand with Acrobat x3, maximizing my score while mitigating risks!\n**Planning the final hand strategy**\n\nWith Acrobat x3, I could score between 12k and 20k, which is exciting! My plan should focus on creating a strong hand for the final round by using discards to achieve a pair, two pair, or even a full house. I want to use Hierophant to generate bonus cards and Death to duplicate them, but I’ll need the right targets in hand. I can set this up after the first discard. Alright, let’s proceed with the play_round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
