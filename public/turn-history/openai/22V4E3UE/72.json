{"reasoning":"**Analyzing discard strategy**\n\nI'm considering using the discard option to draw another 7 or 5 to aim for four of a kind or possibly five of a kind, even though I don't have wild cards. I can discard up to 5 cards, but I need to maintain a strong full house too. Mystic offers a +15 multiplier with 0 discards, and I initially estimated the full house score to be around 7006. I can assess different combinations for the highest score, especially focusing on odd-ranked cards.\n**Choosing optimal card combinations**\n\nI need to pick the 5 cards with the highest base chips for my full house. One possible combination is 7-7-7 with a pair of 9-9, which gives me a triple of 7 and a pair of 9. This has a higher chip value compared to using a pair of 5s since 9 has more chips. I can also consider 5-5-5 with a pair of 9-9. However, the best combination seems to be triple 7 and pair 9, yielding a chip sum of 39. Plus, with Odd Todd, each scored odd card adds +31, boosting my total significantly!\n**Calculating full house chips**\n\nI'm working on the expected chips for a full house at level 1. It starts with base chips of 40 and a base multiplier of 4. Each scoring card adds its rank chips, and Odd Todd contributes an extra +31 for each odd rank card. If I use the combination of 7-7-7-9-9, the sum of cards gives me 39. Adding Odd Todd's bonus for 5 cards makes it 155. So, total chips before multipliers are 234. Combining everything, if Mystic is active and I keep 0 discards, I get a final chip total of 7254, which is unfortunately short by 246 from my target of 7500.\n**Considering strategy without Mystic**\n\nWithout Mystic, my multiplier drops to 16, giving me a total of 3744 chips. I need at least 7500 chips in one hand or across multiple hands. With 4 hands left, it would be easy to hit that target in two hands, like playing a full house for 7254 and then aiming for a small hand. However, winning in one hand could preserve my hands for money and enhance my Acrobat score. Yet, winning earlier may end the round, preventing a final big score. So, I need to balance winning quickly while keeping money considerations in mind.\n**Evaluating discard strategy for winning**\n\nIf I win in two hands, I earn $2, but winning in one hand is better overall. I want to maximize my full house chips, so I consider aiming for four of a kind. I can discard one card and try to draw a fourth 7, 9, or an additional 5. There are limited cards left: 1 seven and 2 nines. I can safely discard three 5s to maintain my 7-7-7 and 9-9 full house. \n\nDiscarding those gives me a 7.7% chance of drawing the remaining 7 in three draws. If successful, I would have four of a kind; if not, I still have a strong full house. So, discarding three 5s seems like a low-risk move while keeping my best options open. I want to play my hand wisely without risking my full house.\n**Preparing to discard cards**\n\nThe best move is to use my last discard command before I play. I’ll discard the two 5s and one 7. After discarding, I plan to play my full house with the 7s and 9s. Since I’m allowed to discard up to 5 cards, I’m all set to proceed. I just need to take action now and execute the discard. It’s time to make the right move!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,5,7]"}
