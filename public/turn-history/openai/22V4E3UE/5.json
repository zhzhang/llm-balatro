{"reasoning":"**Evaluating consumable strategy**\n\nNeptune is a consumable, and if I buy it, it’ll go into the consumables inventory, which is limited. I might want to use it immediately to avoid taking up a slot. I realize that buy_and_use_consumable works only for cards that don't target other items. Planets like Neptune are straightforward, so using it is good for a straight flush. However, I wonder if I should save slots for more useful items. Since it's free, I'll take it now, use it, and free a slot later.\n**Planning next steps**\n\nI’ll start with Neptune in position 1, and then I'll buy card 2 to get Lusty Joker for free. After that, I can buy a free buffoon pack that will present me with choices. But I can usually only do one action at a time, so we should prioritize free actions first. Since Neptune is free and can be used right away, it might be best to use it for an upgrade before anything else. I'll set the action to buy_and_use_consumable at position 1 now.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
