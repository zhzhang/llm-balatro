{"reasoning":"**Considering discard strategy**\n\nI should focus on using my four discards to improve my hand rather than aiming for two pairs or a full house. If I plan carefully, I can utilize all discards before the big scoring hands. Mystic Summit rewards me with a +15 multiplier when there are no discards left, which is a significant boost. However, I should also keep in mind that the final Acrobat hand has x3 scoring potential. My goal is to maximize points while using my discards wisely!\n**Strategizing discards for hand improvement**\n\nI've got four discards, which is great since it allows me to shape my final hand more strategically. In Balatro, I can discard up to five cards each time, then aim for two pairs using odd ranks like A, 9, and 3. However, I'm working with an 8-card hand and can choose up to 5 to discard. Maybe I should keep a pair of 2s for low ranks, but since they're even, it might be better to focus on those odd ranks for a stronger hand!\n**Estimating score for two pair**\n\nI'm thinking that with Abstract, Mystic, and Acrobat, any two pair might work, so I need to estimate scoring to reach 22,000. A typical two pair without Acrobat or Mystic requires base chips of 80 and a base multiplier of 5. In Balatro, cards have specific chip values—like Aces at 11, 2s at 2, and so on—plus the Odd Todd adds an extra 31 chips for each odd-ranked card played. If I play Aces and 2s, I can calculate the total chips and multipliers for an effective score!\n**Calculating final chips and multipliers**\n\nI’m working with Mystic and Acrobat for multipliers: Mystic adds +15, making it 35, and Acrobat gives a 3x multiplier, bringing the total chips to 168 times 105, which equals 17,640. That's still short of 22,000! However, I wonder if I miscalculated earlier when I saw a scoring of 29,808. It's possible that the +31 from Odd Todd applies to each odd card as a bonus. I need to explore their scoring method to piece together how they achieved that total!\n**Evaluating scoring possibilities**\n\nI’m considering how Acrobat and Mystic multipliers affect the scoring, especially regarding the 29,808 score possibility. It might have resulted from multiple hands or playing the final hand smartly. If I use Acrobat for a 3x multiplier and assume a base multiplier increase, I need more clarity on base chips and how multipliers stack. Since the objective is to exceed 22,000, I should consider focusing on two pairs to optimize scoring, keeping in mind limitations with spades and aiming for high-value hands without them.\n**Deciding on discards and strategy**\n\nI’m realizing that I can discard up to five cards in multiple rounds. My focus is on keeping pairs, particularly aiming for Aces or 9s. With three Aces and three 9s remaining in the deck, I consider the cards I can discard. Since I have two 2s already, I might aim for strong scoring hands like a flush, which could yield higher chips with odd Todd triggered. However, winning early might limit my ability to use Acrobat for that bonus multiplier. It’s all about balancing my immediate scoring needs with long-term strategy!\n**Planning discards for strategy**\n\nLooking at previous logs, it seems like they used high cards before making a final two pair for 29,808, likely activating Acrobat for a big payout. To reach 22,000, I think I might need to use multiple hands strategically, starting with weaker hands before making a strong final play. Since I have four hands, I can discard up to five cards to improve my chances. I’m leaning towards keeping the Ace♥, 9♣, and 3♣, while discarding lower value cards. This way, I can focus on forming higher pairs!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,6,7,8]"}
