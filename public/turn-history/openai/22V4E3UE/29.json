{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop options**\n\nI need to choose my next shop action with $4 available. The Celestial pack costs $4, while Death costs $3. We already have four jokers, which is good for our multiplier. The upcoming boss says to \"Play only 1 hand type this round\" with 1600 chips. Since we had a flush last time, I think consistency is key. Maybe I should buy the Celestial pack to level up the flush, but Death could help sculpt the deck by converting cards too.\n**Understanding Death tarot mechanics**\n\nThe Death tarot requires me to select two cards from my hand to use it. Typically, tarot involves using two selected playing cards, and in Balatro, it specifically targets cards in hand. It says I can convert the left card into the right one by dragging to rearrange. Buying it for the boss round makes sense, but I'll need to have the desired card in hand when I use it. Although converting could help build pairs or threes, the Celestial pack might be better for leveling up my flush. But then again, with my Abstract Joker, that multiplier is huge!\n**Buying a celestial pack**\n\nI think it's best to level up the hand type I'll use for the boss, which feels like a smart investment for $4. The standard pack costs $6, and I just can't afford that right now. So, I'll go ahead and buy the celestial pack instead. That should increase my chances significantly! The action I need to take is to buy the booster, specifically option 2. It seems like the right move!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
