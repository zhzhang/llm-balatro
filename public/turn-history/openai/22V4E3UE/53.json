{"reasoning":"**Deciding on Joker Purchases**\n\nI'm in the shop with $14 and four jokers, needing to make a choice on what to purchase. The Sly Joker offers a flat +50 chips for pairs, while the Square Joker scales +4 chips for four-card hands. Since I often play two pair, the Square Joker could really help in the long run. I wonder if I should also keep some money for interest or a voucher, but prioritizing the Square Joker sounds wise right now.\n**Evaluating Purchase Options**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy a voucher with my $14. If I go for the Tarot Merchant, I'll only have $4 left, which doesn’t help with interest. I think the interest is $1 for every $5 at the end of the round, so I'd want to keep at least $10 for $2 interest. Buying the Square Joker is a better move since it preserves my interest potential while still offering scaling. The Jumbo Standard pack for $6 might not be as beneficial, and I prefer sticking with the Square.\n**Buying Square Joker**\n\nI’ve decided to buy the Square Joker, placing it at position 2 in the shop cards. Since I have four jokers, the Abstract Joker currently scales to +12, and adding the Square Joker as the fifth will boost that to +15. That's a nice increase! The Square also provides scaling chips plus a +3 multiplier from the Abstract, making this a strong addition. So, the action here is clear: buy the Square Joker.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
