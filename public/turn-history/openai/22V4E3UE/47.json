{"reasoning":"**Deciding on the booster pack**\n\nI'm in the shop and see that I can only get the free Standard Pack booster. I think I'd better buy it. After that, I'll need to pick a card, but the action schema only allows one action at a time. So, it looks like I'll go ahead and just buy the booster for now! That seems like the right choice to make!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
