{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm in a situation where we have to decide whether to play or skip at big blind ante 4, which needs 7500. If I skip, I'll miss a shop after the big blind and go straight to the boss blind. While that would mean losing a chance to earn money with remaining hands, my tag is D6 and rerolls next shop at $0. \n\nIf I stay blind select, I preserve a chance for the next shop, which is vital since we have low funds and reroll costs are high.\n**Evaluating hand values and strategy**\n\nI need to consider the typical hand values, like how a pair at level 4 stands with 55 chips and a multiplier of 5. Earlier, a pair scored 4060 and two pairs about 4680, so I might need two hands to reach 7500. In a big blind scenario, I often have around four hands with two discards, but that can vary. \n\nIf I skip, I get immediate tag benefits but lose the chance to earn $4 and access a shop. However, if I play, winning could lead to a shop after the big blind, plus potential buffs.\n**Assessing strategy with D6 tag**\n\nHaving the D6 tag could be beneficial for the next shop, though I might still manage some rerolls if I have enough money. Unfortunately, we're cash-strapped, which makes rerolls tough to afford right now. Skipping the big blind usually isn’t ideal since it denies money and a shop, but the D6 tag can be powerful early on. \n\nAt ante 4, I think I can beat the big blind easily, so maybe prioritizing money and the shop is key before facing the boss. The boss’s first hand is face down, which is manageable.\n**Deciding to play big blind**\n\nI believe playing the big blind is a safe and beneficial choice. I'd get $4 and a chance to shop before facing the boss, which could help me find a planet for a pair or two pairs—thanks to the telescope! In the shop, the celestial pack might offer options for my most played hands, likely being pairs. \n\nIf I win with leftover hands, I could earn enough to reach $8+, allowing for buffs. Skipping would make me lose that opportunity. The D6 tag for free rerolls is nice, but I can still earn money for rerolls if I play. I'm leaning towards playing. Sure, hitting the 7500 requirement feels challenging, especially with my last hands around 4-5k, but I'll manage, especially with Acrobat for the final hand.\n**Determining hand strategy**\n\nI need to decide on my action for the round, but I'm unsure about the estimated chips. I'm leaning towards aiming for a pair or a two pair. If I go for two pairs, I'd be working with a base of 40 and a multiplier of 3, but a pair has a base of 55 with a multiplier of 5. \n\nThe jokers could strengthen the pair, but two pairs have four scoring cards, which might trigger Odd Todd more often. Previously, two pairs have performed better than just a pair, but I think I’ll keep it flexible for now.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
