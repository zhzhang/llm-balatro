{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m at the shop after buying a square joker and selling a turtle bean, with $10 to spend. I have options including buying a sly joker (but there’s no slot), packs, or a tarot merchant voucher for $10. The tarot merchant doubles tarot appearances, but spending all my money might reduce my interest in the game. Buying a spectral pack for $4 or a jumbo standard for $6 could also improve my deck. I need to think this through!\n**Analyzing card purchase options**\n\nI'm considering a standard pack that may enhance a playing card, but I’m unsure without knowing its contents. The tarot merchant voucher might be significant long-term since it increases tarot frequency, which could boost my deck's effectiveness, especially with the telescope I already have. However, another option is the spectral pack, which is cheap and could yield powerful results, but it also carries some randomness. Keeping $10 for interest could provide extra benefit too, so I need to weigh these choices carefully.\n**Considering tarot merchant purchase**\n\nI can afford the tarot merchant for $10, but I need to consider the opportunity cost. Buying the voucher now would mean losing that $10, but it permanently doubles my tarot frequency, which could lead to creating valuable cards. However, my shop often has limited tarot options. If I buy the voucher, I'd have $0 left until the next round, where I get some money and interest. Alternatively, I could buy a spectral pack for $4, but I don't have enough consumable slots. Given my stable jokers, I think the voucher is the better choice for improving my deck.\n**Evaluating tarot options**\n\nTarots can be beneficial, especially since I already have a telescope, ensuring that celestial packs will always contain a planet for my hands. Doubling tarot frequency increases my chances of finding them in shops, but booster packs can also help. The spectral pack could provide immediate benefits like \"Ankh\" or \"Hex,\" although it carries some risk without a targeted strategy. I’m considering buying the spectral pack for $4 to keep some money for interest, but I also need to think about potential future improvements. Ankh could duplicate my Abstract Joker, but it might replace another joker, which complicates things.\n**Deciding on card options**\n\nI realized that Ankh creates a copy of a random Joker while destroying the others, which isn’t great. Spectral packs can be risky too. The jumbo standard pack might add useful cards, but it’s random and likely not worth it. I can’t buy the sly joker due to slots, but it could add +50 chips for pairs. However, my build already has high chip gains from my current cards. \n\nThe gift card helps with economy but doesn't improve scoring directly, so that complicates my decision. Rerolling the shop for better jokers could work, but I'd need to sell something first. Ultimately, I believe buying the Tarot Merchant voucher will be beneficial long-term, even though it costs all my money right now. So, let's go for it!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
