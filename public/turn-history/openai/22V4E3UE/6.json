{"reasoning":"**Weighing purchase decisions**\n\nI’m considering whether to spend all $10 now or hold back for future purchases. Using a -1 ante can give me some extra time, but it feels painful to have -1 hand per round, especially as the game progresses. Hieroglyph feels situational; I often skip it unless I’m in desperate need. Now, with no jokers and an easy boss ante of 1, I’ll choose to skip the voucher and buy card 1 (Lusty Joker) instead.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
