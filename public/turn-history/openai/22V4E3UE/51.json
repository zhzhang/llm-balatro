{"reasoning":"**Clarifying Stone card rules**\n\nI’m trying to recall the rules about Stone cards in Balatro. I know they’re rankless and suitless, scoring +50 chips when played, but not contributing to the hand’s type. However, I’m unsure if they count for the highest hand. The prompt indicates only cards that contribute to the highest hand can add chips, yet Stone cards still score despite that. It seems they’re always \"scoring cards,\" which might mean their special effects override the basic rules.\n**Evaluating Stone card scoring**\n\nThe Stone card will likely score +50 even if it’s not part of the hand. I can aim for a flush with spades Q, J, 4, and 3, needing one more from the deck, but I could also work on two pair with 4s and 3s, totaling two pairs among four cards. If I include the Stone card, it won't participate in determining the hand type. I’m considering how the other elements, like Jokers and discard chips, will affect my scoring too.\n**Calculating scoring potential**\n\nI’m considering scoring with base chips, multipliers, and the Odd Todd bonus to aim for 4000 points. My last two pairs scored 5544 despite using a big blind. The different blind and a boss effect only reduced my hand size. I think I can still create a winning hand, maybe two. If I estimate a hand with 3s, 3c, 4s, and 4c, I’ll include a queen as a kicker. In Balatro, I’m wondering if the kicker counts as participating in the hand.\n**Clarifying hand composition**\n\nI'm sorting out how scoring works for a 5-card hand in Balatro. If I use all five cards and my best hand is two pair, all five should score, including the kicker. However, the Stone card might not work as a kicker since it has no rank. It seems wiser to use a card like 8h or Q. That said, I can also opt for just four cards: 3s, 3c, 4s, and 4c. It looks like I can still make a valid two pair with those!\n**Finalizing play strategy**\n\nI'm working through the strategy for my hand. If I use the Stone card as the fifth card, it might still add +50 chips while keeping the hand type as two pair. However, since its status is unclear as a non-participating card, I’ll err on the side of caution by including a regular kicker, like a queen. I estimate the hand, including the enhancements from Odd Todd and the Banner. I think using four cards plus the Stone card gives me good potential for scoring over 4000 chips, possibly aiming for around 5000.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,7,8,9]"}
