{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop strategy**\n\nOkay, so I’m figuring that if I skip the small blind, I would get $15 when redeemed, but I miss a $3 reward in the current shop. If I skip, I’d go right to the big blind and wouldn’t get to shop until I beat it. While $15 is significant and could buy items like To the Moon later on, I need to remember that different items will appear in future shops. That might change my strategy.\n**Considering gameplay strategy**\n\nSo, I'm weighing whether getting $15 for To the Moon is worth it, even though I can't buy it right now. I need to factor in the upcoming boss debuffs related to spades. Our deck has several spades, and Odd Todd triggers with specific cards across all suits, but the debuffs mean some cards won't help us trigger chips. I’m also considering whether I should play or skip the small blind. We've got a score of 17,640 with two pair, and the ante needs 11,000, which should be manageable with our jokers. But that $15 tag is huge!\n**Analyzing potential outcomes**\n\nI’m considering the downsides of losing a $3 reward and the chance to earn interest, though we currently have $0, so there's no interest anyway. Playing could give us that $3 plus an opportunity to shop for useful jokers. Skipping could delay shopping until after the big blind, but the $15 could lead to more significant purchases. \n\nAlso, I’m wondering if playing more hands will increase the tag value at redemption since it counts the total hands from this run. If that's true, skipping now could yield more than $15 later!\n**Examining tag strategies**\n\nThe text says I’ll get $15, meaning the game has already calculated the total hands played and will pay that amount upon redemption, which seems fixed. \n\nI'm pondering if I skip the big blind, I could get a Double Tag that copies the next selected tag. If I skip the small blind to get Handy, I can then decide whether to play or skip the big blind. Skipping the big would let me proceed to the boss with both Handy and Double tags, but I need to consider how the copying works. Taking Double now could let me skip again later for something stronger!\nI'm figuring out if I should skip the big blind to get a Double Tag and then later skip to double another valuable tag. But skipping the big blind means no shop until after the boss, which seems risky since the chips needed are 22,000, especially with the spade debuff in play.\n\nMaybe I should just play the small blind to earn $3 and access the shop for upgrades beforehand. Skipping could give me $15, but if I spend all my chips, it could backfire. I need to balance upgrades and strategy, especially with Odd Todd and how debuffs will interact with our scoring abilities in the game. Playing conservatively might be wise!\nI'm weighing my options here. In a normal deck, spades are 1/4, and I can avoid them by discarding. Since I have no money right now, getting that $15 is tempting for future shops, and I think it might be best to skip the small blind. But if I do skip, I'll lose the chance for the $3 round reward and any potential pay from the remaining hands.\n\nStill, the value of the tag outweighs that short-term loss. I need to consider if I might want to skip the big blind too for the Double Tag, but that means no shop until after the boss, which is risky. \n\nSo, the best plan seems to be to skip the small blind, play the big blind, and then hit the shop with the money from the Handy tag and big blind reward. I’m deciding to skip the round!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
