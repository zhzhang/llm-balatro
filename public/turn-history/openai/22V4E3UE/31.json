{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card choices**\n\nI'm considering using the Death card, which requires having two other cards to convert. I wonder if the trade-off of losing cards is worth it. Selling Odd Todd and Banner for $4 could let me buy Death, but I need to think about the value of Banner—its +30 chips per remaining discard could really add up. Meanwhile, Odd Todd adds +31 for odd cards, which is decent but not as significant as Banner's potential. I'm also aware that selling jokers affects multipliers. What is our current build?\n**Analyzing scoring and strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing how Banner, Odd Todd, and Abstract contribute to my current strategy. With Abstract increasing my multiplier, the flush could exceed 1600 points. I previously had a solid score of 1590, and now with a potential multiplier of 16, I think I can score even higher. For pairs, I might also reach strong scores thanks to my chips and other cards. It seems I don’t need the Death card right now, so I should keep the jokers and proceed to round_select. I’ll prepare my output in JSON format.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
