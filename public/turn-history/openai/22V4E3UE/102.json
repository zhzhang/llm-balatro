{"reasoning":"**Considering purchases and strategy**\n\nEach pack costs $4, and with $22 available, I can purchase both. I can use the planets immediately with no capacity issues, which is great. There's also a Magic Trick voucher for $10 that allows me to buy playing cards in the shop—this could enhance my deck in the long run. I think it's worth buying. I'll consider getting a Rocket next, but I need to determine which joker is the weakest to make room for it.\n**Evaluating game strategies**\n\nAt boss blind and later, discards matter, but I can manage by using all discards before the final hand, which is our current strategy. However, using all discards each round might limit flexibility. That +15 multiplier is significant. The Rocket offers economic benefits, increasing payouts after each boss. If I buy it now, my base payout could grow after defeating each boss. I wonder if I really need the extra money, though, considering our situation.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI'm considering how to approach buying packs and rerolls with the Magic Trick. Sacrificing a joker might be worth it, but scoring could be tight with high blinds, so I should prioritize planets and the Magic Trick. The shop doesn’t show other jokers for scoring. Rerolls cost 5, and while they might yield a strong joker or voucher, they come with risk. I think I’ll start by buying the Magic Trick voucher first to allow access to more cards down the line. So, I’ll go ahead and buy the voucher now!\n**Planning purchases carefully**\n\nI need to confirm we have $22. The voucher costs $10, leaving $12, so I can buy both celestial packs for $8, which leaves me with $4. I could also buy the Sun for $3, leaving $1. It's beneficial to get the Sun since it can convert to hearts, allowing for flushes or straight flushes later. I'll buy the Sun as well, but I need to remember the consumable slot limit. So, I’ll start with the action: buy_voucher 1 and structure it in JSON.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
