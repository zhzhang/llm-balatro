{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI'm considering our options in the game related to big blind ante and chip requirements. If we play the big blind, a win will allow us to shop afterward using the coupon tag, which is great. But skipping to go straight to the boss means we'd get a foil tag for later, although we'd miss an entire shop which could give us an advantage against the boss. We have some good cards, so I'm weighing our chances.\n**Choosing the best strategy**\n\nI think the best move is to use the coupon tag now by playing the big blind. This way, I can access the free shop and grab some upgrades before facing the boss. While skipping the big blind for the foil tag might seem appealing, it also means missing out on important improvements and a $4 reward. So, playing the round appears to be my best option. Now, I need to prepare the output in JSON Action format.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
