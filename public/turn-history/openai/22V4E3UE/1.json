{"reasoning":"**Calculating game strategies**\n\nI need to decide whether to play big or skip to the boss with a starting deck and $4. If I skip, I’ll go to the boss without shopping, but I’ll get a free rare joker and initial items after defeating them. The boss has to be beaten with about 600 chips, and it’s tricky since hearts are debuffed. Still, with no jokers, I think I can manage it by focusing on strong hands like a flush or full house.\n**Weighing card options**\n\nIn a random draw, hearts might show up, but I can still create hands with other suits. The standard play involves four hands and three discards, which should work fine. If I choose to play big now, I get $4 and a shop with free initial items, allowing for the purchase of jokers before tackling the boss. However, if I skip, I retain a rare tag for a free joker later. I need to figure out which is the better option for my chances of winning.\n**Planning the game strategy**\n\nI’ll head to the shop, where I can grab free initial items and buy jokers with my $4 plus rewards from end-round money. This boosts my chances against the boss. While having a rare tag sounds good, I can buy a rare joker in the shop too, though getting it for free is even better. Skipping out on playing big means losing the $4 and the shop, so I believe playing big is the safer choice to maximize my odds.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
