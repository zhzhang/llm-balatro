{"reasoning":"**Assessing game mechanics**\n\nWe’re in a shop, and I’ve got $0 after buying a voucher, so I guess we’re headed to the next round of blind selection or round selection. I'm questioning whether the order of jokers matters for triggering effects. The jokers have specific effects like gaining chips or scoring, and I need to think about their interactions. Odd Todd triggers on scored, while Banner seems to provide chips for each discard. Now, I'm considering if the Square Joker's effect is also dependent on when it’s played.\n**Analyzing joker effects**\n\nThe Square Joker gains +4 chips if the played hand has exactly 4 cards, and I’m thinking it might be dependent on being played. It seems like the order might matter for the jokers that trigger when played, but there’s only one in that category. Banner is independent and gives extra chips, while the Gift Card is about the end of the round and doesn't affect scoring. In the end, I think my action should be to proceed with round selection.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
