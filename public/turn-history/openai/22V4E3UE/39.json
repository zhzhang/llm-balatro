{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI'm thinking about Turtle Bean, which gives a hand size that decreases by 1 each round. So, if it's normal at 8, then +2 makes it 10, but the boss adjusts that down to 9. That still seems solid. As for Marble, it adds stones blind each round, giving 50 chips when part of a hand. Wait, since stones have no rank or suit, they don't count for poker but can still impact hand formation. It’s a bit complex!\n**Understanding stone cards and purchases**\n\nI think this is about stone cards, with the Marble Joker adding one Stone card to the deck when selected. The text says it gives \"+50 Chips\" with no rank or suit, meaning it can't be part of a poker hand. However, it still scores 50 chips when played, which seems to work independently of the hand. Now, regarding shop items: the Mars planet is free and can be used later. It might be smart to grab it for leveling up, even though our build leans toward pairs.\n**Considering card purchase strategy**\n\nIf I buy the card, it will become a consumable in my inventory, and since I have no consumables right now, I'm allowed to purchase it. It costs nothing, which is a bonus! I want to consider holding onto the Planet for later use, even though using it immediately might not hurt. Right now, the most commonly played hand is a pair, so I’m thinking about future strategies alongside the Telescope voucher. Buying Mars doesn't affect that plan, so I should definitely grab it for free!\n**Evaluating card pack options**\n\nThe Standard Pack is free, and I have the chance to add one playing card. It seems beneficial to consider odd ranks like A, 9, 7, 5, or 3 for Odd Todd. Picking a random card might not be great, but I can choose from three options, which could be useful. I also need to think about making room for the Gift Card, which increases the sell value of all jokers and consumables. But to do that, I’d have to sell an existing joker, like Marble, which might actually be weaker in the long run.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nThe boss reduces hand size by -1, but that isn't a huge deal. The Gift Card increases sell value, which is a good benefit. I’m thinking about whether to keep Marble or skip the Telescope. However, the Telescope is a strong option. I’ve decided to go ahead and sell the joker for 5. I'll make sure to return that as a JSON action for my records.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
