{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop decisions**\n\nI’m in a shop with $10 and two jokers: Lusty Joker and Banner. I can see a free Standard Pack, a $10 Hieroglyph voucher, and a $5 reroll cost, but no shop cards. Considering that there’s an early ante1 boss coming up, I think the free Standard Pack would help improve my deck. The Hieroglyph effect (-1 ante and -1 hand each round) doesn’t seem great early on, so I’ll go for the free pack first.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
