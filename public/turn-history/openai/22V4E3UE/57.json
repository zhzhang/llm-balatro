{"reasoning":"**Analyzing poker strategy**\n\nI'm considering the Odd Todd ranking system with ranks A, 9, 7, 5, 3. My hand includes 7H, 7D, and 3D, which would score me +31 chips. Abstracting it further, adding +15 for a multiplier. I believe I can aim for two pair or a full house. I've done well with two pair levels previously. If I draw another 10 or 7, it could help. The stone card adds +50 chips but complicates scoring. I wonder how best to incorporate it!\n**Formulating poker strategy**\n\nI'm thinking through the card play. If I use exactly four cards, I can't include the stone card. However, I can play 10S, 10D, 7H, and 7D for a four-card two pair, which would trigger a Square +4. The Banner gives me 120 since I haven't discarded yet. With Odd Todd scoring +31 for each 7, I’m adding up chips. The base chips for two pair is 40, plus chip values from each scored card, totaling 256 after everything. I might end up with 260 after considering Square!\n**Evaluating chip totals**\n\nI'm calculating my multipliers: base of 3 plus an abstract +15 gives me a total of 18. Doing the math, I end up with total chips around 4608 or maybe 4680, which isn’t enough to hit 5000. The previous two pair gave me over 5k, possibly due to more card chips. I could play a 5-card two pair but it won’t score the kicker. I think sticking to the four-card play is wiser, or maybe consider using the stone to play a pair, but it complicates scoring!\n**Planning card play**\n\nI'm contemplating whether to play a high card or a pair. If I go with a pair of 10s using the stone and the 7 and 3, the highest hand would just be the pair of 10s, where only the 10s score. Instead, I can create a two pair with 7s and 10s, which is better. I wonder about flushing, but I only have two diamonds and one 10, so that won’t work. I think my best move is to play two pair now to optimize points! I'll use cards 1, 3, 5, and 6: the 10S, 7H, 10D, and 7D.\n**Calculating chip estimates**\n\nI’m estimating my chips to be between 4600 and 4800, aiming for a two pair hand. I need to consider the Square Joker, which gives gains of +4 chips if I play exactly four cards. This would add to my chips before scoring, and it appears to contribute to my total chips as well. So I’ll add those +4 chips for a total of 4680. However, I still need to reach 5000 chips, which leaves me with a shortfall of 320. I think I'm ready to play!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6]"}
