{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI think enhancing my cards and improving my deck is a smart move. With the Tarot Merchant, the arcana cards could appear more frequently, but the pack might deliver immediate value. The Buffoon card could provide a better joker, but I'd need to sell something first. I could opt to buy the Arcana pack first to potentially gain money, like the Hermit card. However, it would be used immediately after opening. Ultimately, I need to choose one: Arcana or Buffoon. Given my current funds, I’ll go with Arcana.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI think keeping the Gift Card is a smart plan since it'll keep scaling every round, allowing for later purchases. I’m considering whether to buy the Arcana pack first, which could get me cards like the Hermit to increase my money or the Temperance card for cash based on jokers. Buying the Arcana pack seems like the best option right now. I’ll go ahead and choose to buy the booster for the Arcana pack. After this, I’ll be prompted for immediate selection.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
