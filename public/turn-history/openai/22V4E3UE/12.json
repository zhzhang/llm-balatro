{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m considering our situation in the shop with just $5 and two jokers: Lusty and Banner. I see that the Lovers tarot card costs $3, while the Sock and Buskin joker is too expensive at $6. The Lovers could be a wild card, which might work well with Lusty for flushes since it counts as any suit. I think buying Lovers for $3 and using it immediately could help us out, leaving us with $2.\n**Deciding on a purchase**\n\nI'm considering the Lovers card and whether it requires a specific target in hand. Actually, I realize that in tarot, it uses a selected card from the deck. If I buy it, it becomes a consumable. My options include buying the card now, which would add it to our consumables. While I could save the money for later, buying early in the game seems beneficial. After purchasing, we'd have $2 left, so I think buying the Lovers is the right move. Let's go ahead and choose buy_card 1!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
