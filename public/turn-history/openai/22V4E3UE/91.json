{"reasoning":"**Evaluating scoring order**\n\nI’m considering the scoring mechanics here. Usually, the order doesn’t matter at the end of scoring, but could interactions with cards like Lucky Cat affect that? Maybe rearranging the jokers would make sense to position Hanging Chad leftmost among the scored jokers? \n\nI see the potential implications of other jokers as well. It appears the order could matter if jokers depend on score values, but for maximizing chips per card, it may be irrelevant. Let’s explore this further!\n**Analyzing joker order**\n\nI’m thinking about the order of jokers in relation to the scoring mechanics. Acrobat x3 should go to the right of the additive multiplier jokers, which means they need to add their effects first, then Acrobat can multiply. The current sequence is Odd Todd, Abstract, Mystic, Acrobat, and Hanging Chad. \n\nI see that the ordering between categories is fixed — Odd Todd and Hanging Chad for category 3, while Abstract, Mystic, and Acrobat belong to category 5. This means the order for jokers has to follow the overall list in a way that considers the trigger conditions.\n**Deciding joker order**\n\nI’m sorting out the order for scoring jokers. The on-scored jokers can be placed anywhere since they will show up during step 3 in their list order. For step 5, we only process independent jokers, meaning any on-scored jokers in between get skipped. The current order of Abstract, Mystic, and Acrobat looks good since they have the correct multiplicative benefits. \n\nI note that for category 3, these jokers will activate left-to-right. Since Odd Todd triggers before Hanging Chad, it seems fine for initial scoring. Given there are no resources, the best action now is to go with round_select.\n**Reconsidering joker order**\n\nI’m thinking about whether rearranging Hanging Chad before Odd Todd would be beneficial, especially if Odd Todd gets debuffed by a boss. However, after considering it, I don’t think that adjustment is necessary. It seems like the current order stands well, so I’ll proceed with round_select. That feels like the right move given the situation. Let's keep it simple and follow through with that decision!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
