{"reasoning":"**Weighing options for purchase**\n\nI have $3 in the shop, but everything costs at least $4. My best bet is to either select a round or consider selling a joker to afford a business card or booster. Selling the Lusty for $2 bumps my total to $5, which is enough for the business card. But is it worth it? The Banner offers a strong early game boost, while the Lusty is more situational. The business card could provide extra economy, especially with the face cards I have.\n**Analyzing resource management**\n\nThe business card looks promising for early economy but requires extra slots; I have 5 but only 3 are currently used. I could sell a low-value card, like the Lusty Joker, to purchase it, but I lack multiplier scaling at the moment. The Banner and Turtle offer consistency, though I worry about needing more multipliers for tougher antes later. The Lusty Joker does provide some multiplier potential if I can play hearts, but they're quite rare. Maybe selling the Banner feels risky, while the Turtle Bean is unique. I could also opt to hold everything, but I only have $3 for interest building.\n**Evaluating options for ante 2**\n\nAs the next ante begins, I can earn money by beating the blinds. The Business Card would improve my economy, but I'd need to sell the Lusty Joker for $2 to afford it, which leaves me with only $1. I could also buy a Celestial pack for $4 to enhance my hand type, or consider the Buffoon pack for a new joker. However, I wonder if the Lusty is worth more for its multiplier potential. Selling Banner might work too, but ultimately, I’m leaning toward keeping Lusty and skipping the Business Card.\n**Deciding on card trades**\n\nLosing the Banner might hurt my scoring on low hands, but I could rely on the Turtle to strengthen my hand. However, at early ante 2-3, the Banner’s strong. Selling the Turtle for $3 doesn’t feel right since I paid $6 for it, so I'll keep that. My other option is just to go to round selection, but that would waste the shop. Selling the Lusty could let me buy the Buffoon pack, which might provide a better joker. Although it’s a gamble, it could improve my multiplier or economy, making it worth considering.\n**Choosing actions for strategy**\n\nI’m considering selling nothing and relying on my current $3, but high-value opportunities like the Business Card might be worth pursuing immediately. I have to sell something since I'm limited on jokers; I currently have 3 out of a max of 5. The Banner offers great chip advantages, while the Lusty needs hearts, which can be unreliable due to boss debuffs. Although I’d prefer to keep both, selling Lusty could help me buy the Business Card for economic gain. So, my next move will be to sell the Lusty Joker.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
