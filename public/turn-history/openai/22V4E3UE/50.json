{"reasoning":"**Clarifying game mechanics**\n\nI'm trying to understand the hand size mechanics here. It says \"+2 hand size, reduces by 1 each round,\" but the current amount isn't clear. Turtle Bean usually gives a +5 hand size. So I’ll treat it as +2 for now, but I'm not sure if it has already reduced. A -1 hand size could be a challenge but manageable. I need 4000 chips. Looking back, I got 5544 from a two pair, so I could likely beat that again. I'll need to consider the order of jokers for scoring.\n**Determining game mechanics for action**\n\nOkay, I’m working through the triggers for the game. For scored triggers, only Odd Todd matters, and the order doesn’t seem to affect it. As for independent jokers like Banner and Turtle Bean, it also appears the order is not crucial. Since Abstract adds multiplicative bonuses, I'll place it after any multipliers. Knowing Banner adds chips and those are additive helps too; no need to rearrange them. I’ll proceed with playing the round and will set the intended hand type to either “two pair” or “pair,” though I’m still unsure. I think I’ll just go ahead with “two pair”—let’s see how it goes!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
