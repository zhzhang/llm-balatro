{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tag strategies**\n\nI’m considering the tag system for redeeming rewards. It seems like using a tag when entering a shop can trigger bonuses like a free mega celestial pack, which has great value. Since we're low on money, I’m weighing whether to skip smaller plays to activate the next tag. Although I could earn $4 by playing big, skipping the small play could set us up better for the future. This feels like a careful balance!\n**Weighing options on gameplay**\n\nI’m feeling a bit concerned about skipping the small play since I might lose out on earning interest at the end of the round. However, the small blind does lead to a shop where I could potentially find jokers. If I skip big, I get an extremely strong D6 tag, which is great for rerolls in the next shop. But waiting until after the boss to shop might make it harder. Balancing these choices is definitely tricky!\n**Assessing gameplay strategy**\n\nI’m considering sticking with pairs or two pairs for my hands; I think that might be the safest route. The banner helps by giving extra chips, especially if I don't discard. But the boss’s restrictions may require consistent hand types, making pairs the easiest choice. I believe I can beat 1600 if I play well. Skipping small could lead to a D6 tag, but opting for big blind means getting $4 and a chance to shop. It’s a tricky decision!\n**Evaluating D6 tag implications**\n\nThe D6 tag seems like a big deal, but I’ll need to plan carefully to reach it. Skipping big means going to the boss without a chance to shop, though I still have the meteor tag for a mega pack if I win. Rerolls would start at $0 in the next shop, and I wonder if the tags could stack. However, I might miss the $4 reward and end-of-round income. It's crucial to ensure I can beat the boss without extra money or a shop!\n**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nWithout playing big, my hand levels remain the same. I’m pondering the risks. Given the boss's restriction to one hand type, I feel that playing pairs is my best bet. In previous rounds, I've scored around 280 to 399 chips, but with the ante2 boss threshold now at 1600, I’ll likely need about four hands of 400 each. I think skipping the small to gain a meteor tag for a free mega pack is optimal. Ultimately, I’ll choose to skip the small blind now!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
