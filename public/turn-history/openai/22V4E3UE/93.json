{"reasoning":"**Analyzing poker strategy**\n\nI’m at big blind ante 5, needing 16,500 but only have $15 after skipping the small blind. The current money shows $15 with no tags, which is confusing. I need to decide whether to play the big blind or skip for a Double Tag. If I skip, I’ll go to the boss directly, but there's a chip requirement of 22,000. Playing the big blind could lead to shopping before the boss, which seems like a better risk to manage.\n**Deciding on poker strategy**\n\nI’m considering going into the boss fight with only $15 saved, which won't let me shop until after I beat the boss—a tough challenge. It seems smarter to play the big blind and shop before facing the boss to prepare for the spade debuff. For the order of cards, I’m thinking Hanging Chad should be first, but actually retriggering the first played card might be more important. I’m wondering about the positioning of Odd Todd since it could give me additional chips when scored.\n**Evaluating card triggers**\n\nI’m thinking about the order of Odd Todd and Hanging Chad for retriggering cycles. If Odd Todd comes before Hanging Chad, it could apply again during retriggering. Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card an additional two times, which might happen after scoring. It likely adds to the retrigger count regardless of the order, but retriggering Jokers are applied in step 3 from left to right. So, Hanging Chad’s position could be important during scoring and retrigger stages.\n**Deciding on gameplay strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether the positioning of my retrigger Joker matters when there's only one in play. I think I’ll keep things as they are. Mystic Summit gives a +15 multiplier when there are zero discards left, which means I should aim to use all my discards before the final scoring. It seems like it activates whenever there are no discards at the time the hand is played, so perhaps I should hold my discards for now, but I’m just selecting blind currently, so I'll play on.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
