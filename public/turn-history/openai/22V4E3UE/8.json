{"reasoning":"**Choosing strategies for gameplay**\n\nI’m looking at how the Banner card works, which adds chips and multiplies heart values—definitely a great combo. Banner also helps with all hand types, including two pairs. While discards can vary in use, Banner is consistently strong at the beginning of each hand, giving +30 chips for each remaining discard. With two discards, that’s +60 chips until they’re used. I think Banner stays useful even in later stages, so I'd choose Banner and Zany together.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
