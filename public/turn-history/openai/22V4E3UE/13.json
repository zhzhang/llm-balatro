{"reasoning":"**Evaluating the shop mechanics**\n\nI'm currently in the shop after purchasing Lovers, but I only have $2 left, and other items like Sock and Buskin are too expensive at $6. I can't afford to reroll either. It seems like Lovers requires selecting a card in hand, but I don't have any cards in my hand while shopping. I'm thinking that maybe I can only use it during rounds when I have a hand available. For now, the safest bet is to hold onto Lovers until I can use it properly.\n**Selecting the next round**\n\nUsing Lovers early is possible, but I need a target id, and since I can’t specify one right now, it’s better not to use it yet. Instead, I should proceed with round_select to move on to the next blind selection. I just finished the big blind in Ante 1 Round 1, so after winning the big blind, I can go to the shop and then select the round for the boss. Action: round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
