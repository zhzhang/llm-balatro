{"reasoning":"**Choosing a card for the deck**\n\nI'm looking at the options for adding a card to the Standard Pack. There are three choices: 7C gives me 7 chips, 4C Steel offers 4 chips plus a 1.5x multiplier while it's in hand, and 2S gives 2 chips. Generally, I think the Steel card is best early on since it provides a multiplicative boost and can be held. Even though it's a low rank, that doesn't matter in this case. I'll go ahead and add the Steel card.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
