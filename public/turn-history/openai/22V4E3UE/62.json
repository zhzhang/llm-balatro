{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m in shop ante4 round 7, just after the small blind cleared. I think I'm preparing for the big blind next. I've got $6 and 4 jokers. The cards in the shop include Acrobat for $6, Mystic Summit for $5, and Buffoon pack for $4. I’m considering how to manage my discards. The Banner gives me +30 chips per remaining discard, which might affect how I play Mystic Summit. It’s a bit of a conflict, so I need to think this through carefully.\n**Assessing hand strategy**\n\nI could end up strong once my discards are used, but the Banner benefits from having discards left. Acrobat offers a x3 multiplier on the final hand of the round, which is a plus. If I win too early, I might miss out on that opportunity. I could leave some chips to use the last hand, but that feels risky. Buffoon pack could provide better synergy but costs $4. Should I buy Acrobat and have nothing left, or Buffoon and potentially miss Mystic? I’ll consider better joker options too!\n**Considering upgrade options**\n\nWith a max slot of 5, the Buffoon pack lets me choose a joker, which is appealing as my current jokers are mediocre. I'm leaning toward Buffoon for an upgrade, even though I'm limited to $6. Acrobat is a known strong option, so I need to keep that in mind, especially for the upcoming Ante4 big and boss hands. Earlier scores were decent—around 5k for two pairs and 4k for a pair. Acrobat could triple my multiplier on the final hand, which is crucial for handling the boss!\n**Analyzing potential scores**\n\nIf we play a pair with two aces, that's a lucky start! My base chips would be 55, plus A11 for a total of 77. Adding each Ace gives me an extra 31, so that's 139 now. If I have the Banner with 2 discards left, that gets me to 199. The Square adds chips when I play exactly 4 cards, giving me +8 chips. If I can add Acrobat on the final hand for a multiplier of 3, I could reach around 10,557 chips. That's impressive!\n**Deciding on final hand strategy**\n\nAcrobat seems like the key to clearing high blinds with a strong final hand, but winning early would mean I miss out on that potential. I can start with smaller hands to approach the threshold, which requires some control. The Buffoon pack might give me an active xMult joker, like \"The Trio,\" but I’m unsure about that. Mystic Summit offers a +15 multiplier if I play with no discards, but that conflicts with the Banner. So, my best purchase is Acrobat for $6 to fill my joker slot, and I’ll place it wisely to maximize my multipliers later.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
