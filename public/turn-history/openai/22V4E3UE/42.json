{"reasoning":"**Deciding on booster selections**\n\nI’m in a shop where I see free packs: Mars, Mega Arcana, and Standard. I have $2, but I should take the free stuff first. Maybe I’ll open the boosters before buying Mars? I have two consumable slots, and for the Arcana, I can choose two tarot cards to use right away. For the Standard pack, I can pick one from three playing cards, so I might opt for odd ranks. Since everything is free, let’s buy the Mega Arcana booster first!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
