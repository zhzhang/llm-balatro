{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nIf I skip the small blind, it seems we go to the big blind selection. The Marble Joker triggers when the blind is selected. I'm wondering if skipping counts as selecting. Since it adds a Stone card to the deck when the blind is chosen, I'm thinking skipping might still be relevant. If I skip both blinds, would I add a Stone card twice? I need to check if each selection counts. Overall, if skipping counts, that could be beneficial, but stone cards could also complicate hands.\n**Analyzing stone cards**\n\nIn Balatro, the stone card counts as a card in hand and scores 50 chips when played, but it doesn't help the hand itself. I think it scores each time it's played, even if it's not part of the poker hand. However, the system prompt mentions it only counts for the highest hand, but special effects could override that. The stone card's text suggests it always scores. I’m also considering skipping the small blind to secure a coupon tag since my funds are low.\n**Weighing options for tags**\n\nI could skip the big blind for a foil tag, but that means forfeiting $4 and missing a shop opportunity. However, the coupon tag would make the next shop free. If I skip the big blind, I’ll have only $2 left to face the boss. The shop after winning against the boss would be free too, plus I’d earn $5 and keep any leftover funds. I think maximizing my tags by skipping both blinds is the way to go! That way, I can get both the coupon and foil tag, adding some useful cards, too.\n**Clarifying shop benefits**\n\nThe free initial \"cards and booster packs in the next shop\" means the items are free, including possibly jokers! This is a strong advantage, and I should definitely check that shop after the boss fight. If I skip the big blind, I won't see the shop after the small blind, but playing the big blind would allow me to use the coupon tag for the shop after it. Skipping the small blind but playing the big gives me a coupon-free shop right before the boss, which is a great strategy. However, if I skip the big blind too, I risk facing the boss without improvements. I need 4000 chips for the boss with a -1 hand size.\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI think our current build can beat the 4000 total with 2 hands, but the boss’s -1 hand size might affect our ability to make strong hands. I want to play it safe by skipping the small blind to get the coupon tag, then playing the big blind to access the free shop before facing the boss. However, I’ll miss the foil tag that way. Is it worth giving up? The coupon seems more immediate. Looking at our ability to beat the big blind, I believe we can easily manage it, so I’ll skip the small blind to secure the coupon tag. I'll return JSON with the action to skip the round!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
