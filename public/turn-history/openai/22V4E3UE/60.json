{"reasoning":"**Considering card selections**\n\nI’m trying to figure out which cards to target for making high-frequency ranks. Since we often play pairs, including lucky cards in the scoring set seems beneficial. Right now, in my hand, I have a mix of cards, and I wonder which two to turn into Lucky cards. It might be strategic to choose high-frequency odd ranks to align with Odd Todd, like selecting the 4♣ steel. But then, if enhancements are replaced, will it still be effective?\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nSteel cards are valuable since their multiplier for being held is 1.5. I have two steel cards already, and losing them might impact future scaling. Since I don’t have Mime or Baron, I should avoid overwriting steel. So, I think about choosing some non-steel cards like Q♠ and A♥ to turn into Lucky cards. Scoring typically uses pairs, and since there are still three queens remaining, making Q lucky could benefit future plays and scoring well.\n**Considering alternate strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about making low odd ranks like 3♦ to combine with Odd Todd and increase my lucky chances. Even though 3♦ has low base chips, it still triggers a +20 multiplier, which is valuable. With Odd Todd, odd-ranked cards like A, 9, 7, 5, and 3 get an additional +31 chips when scored. Since I have Ace of Hearts and 3♦ in hand, it makes sense to make both lucky, especially since Ace carries high chip value while still considering the potential for paired plays.\n**Analyzing scoring strategy**\n\nI’m considering including 3 as a kicker in a pair hand, but that won’t actually score. To score with 3, it needs to be part of a pair, which isn't as frequent. Aces, being odd, seem more likely to form pairs since they’re valuable. Two aces would be ideal, but I only have one. Choosing Ace and Queen is an option, although Queen isn’t odd. I find that opting for a guaranteed Magician seems smarter for improving my scoring potential overall.\n**Making card selections**\n\nNow I need to avoid steel cards in positions 3 and 7. I'm considering choosing Ace of Hearts and either Queen of Spades or 10 of Clubs. The 10 is even, so it won't work with Odd Todd. The Ace is odd, which is good. Picking Ace and Queen seems solid since they have high chip values, but I wonder about pairing with 3♦ instead. However, creating pairs with cards like Aces and 3s might be challenging. I'll go with selecting The Magician, targeting Queen of Spades and Ace of Hearts for potential scoring.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1,4]"}
