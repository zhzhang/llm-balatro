{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategies**\n\nI’m looking at consumables and how targets are used during the rounds, which seems alright. The Arcana pack at $4 gives random tarots for immediate use, while the Jumbo Standard pack at $6 adds playing cards. It might be useful to include more odd ranks like 7s and 9s, but random selection is tricky. Given the current deck's makeup, it seems manipulated; there’s only one seven left. Earlier, we had more 5s and 7s, possibly indicating that the deck is thinning. After discards, the deck remaining should have been 35, since a full deck is 52.\n**Planning card purchases**\n\nI’m considering picking 9s and 7s. The Hierophant allows selection of 2 cards from the hand, so buying it at $3 seems beneficial. Then there's the Death card, which duplicates a card in the deck and increases the chance of drawing duplicates, great for getting a full house or four of a kind. If we duplicate a strong card, like a high odd rank, it could be really useful.\n\nWith just $9, if I buy both cards, I’ll have $3 left, which means I can’t reroll or buy an Arcana pack.\n**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI'm wondering if it might be better to buy the Arcana pack first since it could give me strong tarot cards like Temperance or The Sun. However, it's random and immediate use, which means I can't store it. With the Telescope, I think it’s best to wait for Celestial packs to level up pairs, but they're not available now.\n\nMaybe I should still consider buying the Arcana pack for a chance at a planet card, since the Jumbo Standard pack at $6 can also add cards. I also need to save some money for future shops since the boss might require more chips, maybe around 10k or so. Having consumables could definitely help!\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI see that Mystic Summit wants no discards, while we usually rely on discards during play. For the boss, I think we can manage, so I should buy both Hierophant and Death to have useful tools for the upcoming ante. I need to check our capacity though, since we can only hold a maximum of 2 consumables, and buying both will fill us up.\n\nAlternatively, I could buy an Arcana pack instead of one of the tarot cards, but it uses immediately and isn’t guaranteed to help. Hierophant and Death provide more controlled improvements, so I’ll go ahead and purchase Hierophant first, followed by Death as my next action. If we can only do one action per turn, then it’s best to start with Hierophant.\n**Weighing card impacts**\n\nI’m trying to figure out which card is more impactful between Death and Hierophant. Death can duplicate a strong card later, while Hierophant gives +30 chips to two cards, and with Odd Todd's +31 chips, the Bonus makes it even better. If I score high multipliers, those chips add up!\n\nFor scoring, the mathematics look promising: +30 chips multiplied by a potential 93 brings in a significant amount. Since we can hold and use both cards in the same round, I think buying Hierophant now is the right choice!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
