{"reasoning":"**Strategizing card play**\n\nI’m at a shop with $0, where the only item is The Sun for $3, which I can't afford to reroll. The best action is to proceed with round_select. However, I'm considering rearranging the order of my jokers for scoring since their placement triggers left-to-right. Odd Todd seems important for scoring schemes, giving me +31 chips for each odd-ranked card. The ordering of these jokers impacts their effectiveness during scoring, particularly for retriggers. It’s all about optimizing their potential!\n**Analyzing joker activation**\n\nI’m looking at how independent jokers activate after held cards, considering their effects from left to right. Abstract adds a +15 multiplier, while Mystic provides a conditional +15, and Acrobat contributes a conditional x3 for the final hand. It seems like the order matters because additive multipliers should precede multiplicative ones for maximum scoring. So ideally, I’ll position Acrobat rightmost since it multiplies the base score. Rocket can go anywhere since it doesn’t affect scoring, but I might place it after Acrobat for clarity. This setup seems like it’ll optimize my scoring!\n**Deciding joker order**\n\nI’m thinking about positioning the jokers for scoring. I want Acrobat to be part of the scoring but not necessarily the last joker played. Since Rocket doesn’t affect scoring, its placement is flexible. I realize Rocket likely triggers independently, so its order doesn’t impact scoring. I should arrange the jokers with the additive multipliers (Abstract and Mystic) first, followed by the xmult (Acrobat), and end with utility (Rocket). Odd Todd can go anywhere in the order, maybe even first for early scoring triggers!\n**Rearranging jokers for strategy**\n\nI'm considering the joker order: Odd Todd, Abstract, Mystic, Acrobat, and Rocket. That setup seems solid as it stands. Abstract adds a +15 multiplier since I have 5 jokers. If I move Rocket away, it won’t alter the count, so there's no need to change anything yet. \n\nHowever, buying Rocket might make me want to sell something for cash since I have $0. Selling a joker could fund The Sun, which isn't ideal for my two-pair hand, but might be helpful. Ultimately, I think keeping Rocket for potential future shops is wiser!\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nSelling a scoring joker to buy The Sun doesn’t feel like a good idea. It just seems like a sacrifice that might not pay off. Instead, I think the best course of action is simply to proceed with round_select. I’ll focus on playing the hand rather than making a risky trade. Keeping my scoring joker intact should offer better long-term rewards, so let’s take that route!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
