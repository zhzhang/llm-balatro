{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop with $12. I see that Mars planet cards are free and the Telescope voucher is $10. I can buy Mars as a consumable since it levels four of a kind, though it’s not my main hand. Even though I can hold it for later, I’m limited to two slots. Buying Mars seems safe to use immediately, and opening mega arcana won't occupy slots. The Telescope offers strong benefits for future play.\n**Analyzing purchase options**\n\nI have $12, and rerolling costs $5. I should definitely buy the Telescope for $10, leaving me with $2. I can grab free boosters and the Mars card, which is consumable and free. Should I buy Mars as a card or use it immediately? Buying it first adds to my consumables, but using it right away levels my four of a kind and frees up a slot. However, I might want to keep two slots for future tarots. It's a bit tricky!\n**Considering purchase strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about how Turtle Bean is decreasing hand size each round, so maybe I should keep it. The Gift Card increases sell values, which is helpful, and my jokers are good for chip-heavy odd cards. The Telescope is useful for planets from celestial packs, even though I don't have one now. I plan to buy the Telescope before spending on rerolls. Buying the voucher seems smart to secure it, but I should also consider getting free packs first. Should I rearrange my jokers, too?\n**Determining next actions**\n\nI’m analyzing how some effects are independent. Odd Todd triggers on score, while the Banner likely gives +30 chips for each remaining discard, which applies after scoring—so it seems independent too. The order of jokers matters since they trigger left-to-right on scores. Since the Banner isn’t dependent on scoring, it looks like it’s independent. My plan is to buy the Telescope voucher next, and after that, I’ll consider purchasing boosters. So, time to buy the voucher!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
