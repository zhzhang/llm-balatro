{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m in a shop where the only booster is the Buffoon pack, but it costs 4 and I only have 2 money. I can't buy anything or afford a reroll. Should I sell something to buy the pack? Selling a joker could help, but I wonder if it's worth it. I have different jokers, each with unique benefits. Selling Odd Todd might give me the cash, but I could lose valuable scaling for the game. It's a tricky decision!\n**Analyzing hand options**\n\nI’m considering my hand, which has pairs and includes odd ranks like A, 9, 7, 5, and 3. If I often play pairs, odd ranks might not always be beneficial. With +31 chips for each odd card, playing pairs with two odd cards can boost my score significantly. The Mystic Summit has a condition, needing 0 discards, while the Acrobat is crucial for a strong finish. If I sell Mystic Summit, I could buy the Buffoon pack, but I'd lose that strategic advantage.\n**Considering selling cards**\n\nI’m weighing options to sell cards for cash. Selling Acrobat gives me 3, making my total 5, enough for a reroll or to buy a pack, but I'd lose the x3 multiplier for the final hand. Selling Abstract gives me 4, totaling 6, but I’d lose valuable synergy. Selling Odd Todd also nets 4, bringing me to 6. Buying the pack could yield better jokers, but I'm uncertain if it's worth the gamble. I believe it's better to stick with my current cards and proceed since they support a coherent strategy.\n**Clarifying round and ante dynamics**\n\nI'm trying to get a grip on the current scoring and round situation. Our hands scored around 4-5k, and we're in Ante 4 during round 7. I’m questioning whether this is a small or big blind. Each ante has three rounds, which makes it tricky to count. The progression seems off, but I can confirm I’ve reached round 7 and the ante is at 4. I think we should skip further shop actions and go to round select, utilizing Mystic Summit by managing my discards before the final hand.\n**Establishing joker order**\n\nI need to ensure the order of my jokers is set correctly: Odd Todd, Abstract, Mystic Summit, and Acrobat. Odd Todd triggers its effect when cards with odd ranks score, which is important. Its position in the scoring order matter since it influences how other jokers will be used. For the independent jokers, I should apply the additive multipliers first, so the proper order is Abstract, Mystic, then Acrobat. Odd Todd fits into the scoring category, which is adjusted left-to-right. Everything looks good, so it’s time to proceed with round select!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
