{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card hands**\n\nI'm considering possible hands: I have pairs of 7s, 3s, and 5s, plus a pair of queens. I could form two pairs, like 7s with 5s or 7s with 3s. I wonder about a heart flush, but I only have three hearts. A straight with 3-5-7-9 isn't possible either. For a full house, it's tricky since there's no triple. Given my current build, a single pair with a multiplier looks promising. But would two pairs yield more chip value? I need to figure out which odd cards can score well too!\n**Calculating scoring potential**\n\nIn a pair, only 2 cards score; with two pairs, it's 4 cards, and in a full house, 5 cards. I'm thinking of aiming for two pairs using odd ranks to trigger those Odd Todd bonuses. Three of a kind is out since there's no third matching card. For two pairs, I could use 7H with 7C and 5H with 5D, which could yield 4 odd cards, each adding +31 chips. With some bonuses factored in, I could reach a total of 5544 chips! That’s definitely enough to clear the blind in one hand!\n**Finalizing card play**\n\nI realize that the playing cards already include chips in their descriptions, like +7 chips. So, using the chips in their ranks is accurate. I should definitely play two pairs with 7s and 5s. I can choose card indices 3, 4, 6, and 10, which correspond to 7H, 5H, 7C, and 5D. I need to keep in mind the allowed cards; while I can play up to 5 cards, adding a nonparticipating card risks messing up the hand. So, I’ll stick with these four for my two pair, estimating around 5500 chips!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,6,10]"}
