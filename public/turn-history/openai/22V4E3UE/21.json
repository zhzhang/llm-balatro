{"reasoning":"**Choosing joker options**\n\nI need to decide between two jokers: the Wrathful Joker, which multiplies spades by +3, and Odd Todd, which gives me +31 chips on odd ranks. Considering the Banner chips from discards and Turtle hand size, I definitely need more scoring. Odd Todd seems like the stronger addition since it works with any suit and boosts consistency. Since the Wrathful Joker has similar inconsistency issues as the Lusty Joker, I'll go with Odd Todd. It’s likely the best option for early scoring!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
