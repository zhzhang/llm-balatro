{"reasoning":"**Analyzing a game strategy**\n\nI’m figuring out my hand size, starting with 8 and adding 5 to get 13; then thinking about future rounds. The cost is a bit high, but I have $9 to work with. I’m considering buying the Turtle for $6, which leaves me with $3. But is the Turtle really worth it? It seems like a great early game advantage, especially for making straights or flushes more reliable. I might prioritize it. Alternatively, I could gamble on the Buffoon pack for more scaling.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m weighing the options between buying the Business for economy and a scaling joker or going for the Turtle Bean for consistency. The Turtle Bean can help with saving discards and money, though it decays each round. Since we’re still at ante 2, its temporary boost might help me win. I think I’ll go ahead and buy the Turtle Bean now. After the purchase, I’ll have $3 left, which is fine. I should check the joker slots, but we have enough for now.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
