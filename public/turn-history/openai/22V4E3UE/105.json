{"reasoning":"**Evaluating potential payouts**\n\nI'm calculating the payouts! If I buy now, I could see increases after defeating bosses—like from ante5 to ante6, which jumps from 2 to 3 per round, and then keeps rising after each boss defeated. There are limits though, with only 4 antes and 3 rounds per ante. So, for remaining rounds in ante5, I need to figure out how many rounds I have left, including the boss rounds. It seems like I might end up with extra payouts after each boss in my calculations.\n**Calculating payouts and strategies**\n\nI realize that payout increases by $2 when I defeat the Boss Blind, which only affects future rounds; so the current boss round payout is $1. After beating the ante5 boss, my payout becomes 3 for subsequent rounds. Each ante round has 3 rounds, leading to some serious earnings: ante5 gives me 1, ante6 totals 9, ante7 brings in 15, and ante8 adds 21, making it $46 overall! But, I need to think carefully about which joker to sell for the Rocket.\n**Analyzing scoring potential**\n\nIf my main scoring hands are two pair with some odd cards, there's a strategy to retrigger the first played card, which could multiply my Odd Todd chips. Odd Todd gives me +31 chips when I score on played cards. If I retrigger a card, it would score three times! This could significantly boost my chips. I wonder if Hanging Chad is strong enough to replace Mystic Summit, but that +15 multiplier is tempting. If I remove Mystic, my multiplier drops, but I'd still have a decent score with Rocket providing funds without scoring.\n**Considering celestial packs and scoring**\n\nAt ante6+ blinds, I feel like I might need more scoring options. The planets can help by increasing base chips and the multiplier of my hand, so purchasing the remaining celestial packs now could be better than getting the Rocket. Each celestial pack costs 4, and I'd still have options for additional purchases. If I reroll and select Uranus again, it looks like going from level 3 to level 4 increases chips by +20 and the multiplier by +1, which is really helpful!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nIt looks like another Uranus would boost my level 4 chips to 80 with a multiplier of 5, which is significant, especially combined with acrobat x3! My plan is to buy the celestial pack and pick Uranus, unless I see a better option like Mercury. Buying the Sun tarot for heart conversion might not be as crucial since my main hand is two pair, not a flush. It could be better to save my money for rerolls, especially with ante 5 approaching!\n**Evaluating purchases and strategies**\n\nWith $8, spending 4 on a celestial pack means I'd have 4 left, which limits my reroll options. Still, buying the pack seems like the best choice since planets improve both chips and multipliers immediately. If I consider selling Odd Todd for the Rocket, Odd Todd provides steady chips, but it doesn’t boost the multiplier. The Rocket could help with money for upgrades later, but I’d need to balance scoring and potential. Further, having multiple bosses approaching could complicate things, so enhancing my two pair might be the way to go!\n**Evaluating spending strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to spend all my funds. Keeping $8 or at least $5 might give me options later. If I buy a booster for $4, I’ll lose interest next round, but it boosts my scoring potential, which is a tradeoff. If I'm confident about winning upcoming rounds, I might save for rerolls or powerful jokers. However, since the shop currently only has the Rocket as a joker, I think I’ll go ahead and buy the booster, aiming for Uranus to improve my two pair!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
