{"reasoning":"**Weighing shop options**\n\nI'm deciding between two purchases with my $7. I can buy Mystic Summit for $5 and still have $2, or Buffoon for $4, leaving $3. Mystic Summit provides a +15 multiplier when I have no discards left, which could be really useful since we've lost our Banner card and discards may not be valuable. This makes Mystic Summit a strong contender since it triggers a boost each round, especially with our current jokers. Buffoon is random, but I can't reroll after buying.\n**Deciding on Mystic Summit**\n\nI'm calculating the potential net gain multiplier from Mystic Summit, which is +3 with Abstract and can go up to +15 under certain conditions. That’s a significant boost! It's a common card and costs $5, so I’ll go ahead and buy it. With only $2 left afterward, I can’t purchase any additional packs. I need to format this as a JSON action output for the purchase. Let's make sure it’s correctly structured!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
