{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game options**\n\nI'm considering our situation at Blind Select Small, where we need 5000 chips but currently have no money. I see that skipping could give us a Juggle Tag with an improved hand size, but playing might net us $3 and a chance to shop later. Our current scoring is around 5k. I’m weighing the risk: maybe it’s better to skip now for the tag, but we need upgrades. Decisions, decisions!\n**Considering tag strategies**\n\nI’m weighing the impact of the D6 tag, which offers free rerolls at the next shop. To obtain it, we'd need to skip the big blind. If we skip both rounds, we would head into the boss fight with no money, earning only $5 with no access to shops afterward. Playing both rounds seems better since we'd gain more money. However, if I skip just the small blind, I would still miss the shop opportunity. It's tricky!\n**Evaluating gameplay strategy**\n\nI’ve realized that playing small is essential since it helps us access the shop and earn $3. Getting to the 5000 chips should be manageable. The boss in this ante has the first hand face down, which is a bit inconvenient. I’m also considering rearranging the jokers, as their order might affect scoring. However, since they seem mostly independent and some have specific triggers, I might just focus on playing this round and respond accordingly!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
