{"reasoning":"**Deciding next moves**\n\nI need to evaluate the next action based on my current hand: K♠ wild, 7♠, 5♠, K♥, 7♥, 5♥, 7♣, 5♣, while remembering I have 2 discards left. I could easily form a full house with three 7s and two 5s, which would score well. But Mystic Summit only triggers with 0 discards, and I have 2 now. If I discard effectively, I need to keep enough to still complete my full house. Hm, the strategy's a bit tricky!\n**Formulating a discard strategy**\n\nI need to maintain my core hand of three 7s and two 5s. Currently, I have three 7s (positions 2, 5, 7) and four 5s (positions 3, 6, 8). To keep my full house, I should hold those five cards but consider discarding my kings and an extra 5. My first step could be to discard both kings and maybe an extra 5, like the one in position 3. It’s tricky, though, since I want to activate Mystic using my two discards wisely!\n**Reassessing hand potential**\n\nI’m considering whether I should fish for a 7 or 5 to aim for four of a kind. However, since I’m keeping my full house core of three 7s and two 5s, I might discard my kings and an extra 5. Interestingly, with three 5s in hand, I could actually create four of a kind by playing those plus one of my 7s. Since four of a kind scores higher than a full house, it’s worth strategizing around that!\n**Evaluating hand possibilities**\n\nI think I miscounted my 5s—I only have three, which isn’t enough for four of a kind. But I could create a flush with the wild K♠ acting as any suit. I have three spades (7♠, 5♠) and I need two more. Since there aren’t enough spades, I can't make a flush, but I can confirm a full house. By using Mystic Summit, my base multiplier increases significantly, leading to a total of 7006 chips! That’s quite a score!\n**Planning strategy for winning**\n\nI realize I need to reach 7500 chips but I'm short at 7006 by 494. To improve my score, I could aim for a full house using 5s and 7s. I considered making pairs or three of a kind, but full house is my best bet. By utilizing my two discards intelligently—maybe discarding both kings and a 5—it might keep my core hand intact. I still want a chance at the remaining 7 to aim for four of a kind, so keeping three 7s and two 5s seems safest!\n**Refining discard strategy**\n\nI think the best approach is to use my discards to activate Mystic and enhance the chip value of my full house while keeping my main cards intact. I have to remember that a full house needs three of a kind and a pair. It could be tricky since my options are limited to 7s and 5s. I should discard the kings, try to hold onto 3 sevens and 2 fives, and use both discards wisely to fish for a fourth 7 or pair. Maximizing my chances while ensuring I don’t lose my core hand seems crucial!\n**Planning discards and strategy**\n\nFor my next move, I'll focus on discarding three cards during my second discard to maximize the chance of drawing a seventh 7 while keeping my triple sevens and one five safe. My goal is to activate Mystic for a solid full house, which requires a guaranteed pair. After computing my chip needs, it seems I can play a high card if necessary, too. So, I’ll start by discarding the two kings to see what new cards I draw. This will get me closer to my objective!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,4]"}
