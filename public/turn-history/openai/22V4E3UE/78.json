{"reasoning":"**Evaluating hand strategy**\n\nI’m considering the best strategy for this boss. With one hand scoring 4-7k and a final hand multiplied by three, we could exceed 10k. But the first hand is face-down, so there’s a risk in misplaying it. I think it might be better to discard that hand entirely to reveal the face-up hand. However, this would use one of our four discards, which complicates things since Mystic wants us to use up all discards before playing big scoring hands.\n**Considering discarding strategy**\n\nIn Balatro, when I discard selected cards, I draw replacements to maintain my hand size. So, if I discard five cards, I’d end up with eight cards again, likely revealing the face-up hand. The boss indicates that the first hand is drawn face down, but I think the new cards would be face up since they’re drawn after the discard. I should discard all eight, but the command allows only five, so I plan to discard five first, leaving two for later.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
