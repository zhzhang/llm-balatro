{"reasoning":"**Figuring out the best hand**\n\nI'm in a game situation where I need 10,000 points, but I've got only 299 chips left. I have one hand to play and no discards. Mystic Summit is active, giving me a +15 multiplier. With my current hand, I need to create the best scoring combination of 5 cards. I have pairs of 9s and 8s, which is great for two pair. I believe I can play just 4 cards for that hand, even though a kicker won’t score but might have other effects.\n**Comparing scoring options**\n\nI’m considering how Odd Todd awards +31 chips for odd ranks, so those 9s will help significantly. The Ace is also odd, but it doesn't contribute to scores if it's not part of a pair. I’m leaning toward making a two pair since it scores 4 cards, boosting my chips further with Odd Todd. \n\nBut I need to compare that to a pair of 8s, which gives a higher base. After calculating multipliers and totals, it looks like two pairs could bring in a higher score overall.\n**Calculating chip totals**\n\nI’ve hit the target of 10,000 points, so I’ll play the 8s and 9s. I need to ensure that the boss effect is considered; I already drew face-down cards, so no further effect there. Odd Todd boosts my points for the odd ranked cards, which means each 9 adds +31 chips each!\n\nI’ll compute the total chips: for the two pairs, the base chips are 40, and adding the scoring cards gives a full total of 196. Now it's time to compute the multipliers! The base multiplier for two pairs is 3, plus bonuses from jokers and Mystic Summit.\n**Finalizing the chip calculation**\n\nI’m determining any additional multipliers for my final hand. The Acrobat effect gives me an x3 multiplier. So, the total multipliers amount to 30, leading to a final effect of 90. Multiplying that by my total chips of 196 gives me 17,640 chips.\n\nI’ll play the cards in positions [1,2,6,8] (9♠, 8♠, 8♣, 9♦), ensuring they’re ordered for scoring because Odd Todd triggers on each scored card. The hand type is two pair, and my estimated total is 17,640—time to respond with the JSON action \"play.\"\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,8]"}
