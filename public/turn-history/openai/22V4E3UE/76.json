{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m in a shop with $3, and boosters cost too much to buy. Since I can’t get anything and already have two consumables full, I think my best option is to proceed to the next blind round after defeating the big blind. I'm considering selling a consumable to get $4 for an Arcana pack, but I wonder if giving up cards like Death or Hierophant is worth it. Their synergy is strong, especially before facing the boss blind.\n**Analyzing tarot and consumable options**\n\nTarots need targets from the hand, and I can use them during the round before playing. In Balatro, consumables can be active between hands, so that’s good! I’m thinking about selling a consumable to buy an Arcana pack, but since I already have two strong tarots, I wonder if it’s worth it. Selling would leave me with $0 and no tarots, which doesn't seem smart. I'll stick with using what I have and proceed with round selection. Rearranging jokers is also a consideration since their order affects triggers.\n**Optimizing trigger order**\n\nIt seems better to add the multipliers first, then apply the multiplication. I have Abstract (+12) and Mystic (+15) as additive multipliers, so I should place Acrobat x3 right after them. The current order is: Odd Todd (scored), Abstract, Mystic, Acrobat. Since Abstract triggers before Mystic and then Acrobat, that works well for me. Odd Todd's earlier trigger seems less crucial since it just deals with chips. So, I’ll keep that order and proceed to round selection!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
