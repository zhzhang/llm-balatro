{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Tarot mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about how the Fool card creates the last used Tarot or Planet card. The last was Mercury, which seems excluded this time. Usually, it would create Mercury, but with the exclusion, I'm worried it might fail. The tooltip suggests it should mention excluded cards, but I'm confused about whether it should say it excludes Mercury or the Fool itself. There are also other options like converting cards to Hearts or enhancing cards to Steel. So much to consider here!\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI’m analyzing the Hermit card, which doubles my current $2 to $4—not a huge boost, but it's decent for now. I should use it immediately and think about future gains. The Sun might help build flushes, but my focus is on pairs and two pairs. Using the Telescope can help target my most played hands, like pairs, so I can draw Mercury often. Plus, the Chariot is promising for scoring with Steel as long as it stays in hand after playing. Lots to consider here!\n**Formulating a card strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about the need for a solid strategy. We could select a Steel card and keep it in hand while playing up to five other cards, as the Steel card gives a x1.5 multiplier when held. The Turtle Bean increases hand size, which makes it easier to hold the Steel card, although it reduces by one each round. The Lovers wild card might help with flushes and straights, but the timing feels off. The Fool could possibly bring in the Mercury card to level up a pair, but I'm not certain since exclusions might come into play. Interesting choices ahead!\n**Deciding on card selection**\n\nI’m considering the strategy around pairs and how planets might increase chips and multipliers. It seems taking Mercury directly would be ideal, but we only have the Fool as an option to potentially create it, which feels risky. I’m leaning toward choosing The Chariot and either The Hermit or The Sun to enhance my hand. The Chariot could turn a chosen card into Steel for benefits. I need to think carefully about which card to select, ideally something that gives flexibility in my strategy.\n**Planning card choices**\n\nI’m analyzing the options for playing cards. Since we often use pairs or two pairs, keeping a Steel card in hand is crucial. I’m thinking about choosing the 2 of spades, as it won’t interfere. The Steel card's effect happens when held during scoring, so it needs to be drawn. The Lovers wild card seems less relevant since we’re focused on pairs. I'm considering The Chariot and The Hermit or possibly The Fool for creating Mercury, which would level up a pair. The Fool's effects seem risky, but if it works, it could significantly benefit my strategy.\n**Finalizing card strategy**\n\nI’m considering how the Steel card works. If I play all five cards, the Steel effect won’t trigger, so having unplayed cards is important. With the Turtle Bean increasing hand size, I can keep more in hand. I’m leaning toward selecting the 2 of spades as my Steel card because it’s low rank and less likely to interfere with my strategy. After deciding on the Chariot, I plan to go with the Fool first, as it doesn't need a target. Time to take action!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
