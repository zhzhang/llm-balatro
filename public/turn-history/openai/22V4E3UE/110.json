{"reasoning":"**Deciding on action order**\n\nI'm thinking about the sequence: we should keep Rocket last, but I'm unsure about Acrobat. Rearranging might not change much since it’s free and safe. I can only take one action now, so I need to choose wisely. Playing a round feels like a good option since reordering isn’t crucial. However, the order might matter if Rocket and Acrobat trigger independently, affecting the outcome. Ultimately, I’ll go with the play_round action and prepare to structure the output in JSON format with the necessary fields.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
