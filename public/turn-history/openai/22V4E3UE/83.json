{"reasoning":"**Planning card strategy**\n\nI need to decide my next move since my boss requires 10,000 chips. I currently have 117 chips, three hands left, and two discs. With Odd Todd, I can gain additional chips for odd ranks, and I’ll also leverage my jokers to boost my multipliers. My plan is to discard both discs before the final hand so I can score with Mystic, ensuring a strong finish with Acrobat. I'll play two low hands first and save the stronger hand for last.\n**Optimizing card discards**\n\nI've got a hand with a pair of 8s, which is great, but I need to think carefully about discarding non-essential cards to draw another 8 or create synergy with odd ranks. I can discard up to five cards total, but I'll keep my two 2s since they are good for low hands. Considering my options, I might discard a Queen, 10, or Ace, but I have to remember that odd cards boost my score with Odd Todd. Ultimately, only scored cards in my best hand count.\n**Calculating optimal hand scoring**\n\nConsidering my options, I realize I need a strong final hand. A full house or two pair could work, but since a pair of 8s gives me the highest multiplier with 55 base chips, it makes sense to keep that as my main focus. If I can play only the two 8s in the final hand, I'll gain extra chips since each 8 adds another 38. This could lead to a total score of 12,576 chips, which is substantial!\n**Setting final strategy**\n\nMy final plan is to play low hands to avoid surpassing the 10,000 chips mark before my final hand. For example, playing a single 2 nets me a base of 7 chips, with a total of 13 after the multiplier. I might even use an odd card like a 7 to boost my total, but I must keep everything under 10,000. I’ll preserve my two 8s and use both discards now to draw low cards, just to keep options open without risking my high-scoring cards.\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI'm considering the best use for my first discard. I might want to remove some high cards, but keeping low cards is crucial since I need to play two low hands before the final. I realize that I can discard four cards to potentially draw new ones, but I'm noticing there may be no more 8s left in the deck, which limits my options. It seems discarding now will activate Mystic later, allowing me to score better overall. I’m leaning toward using one discard now, saving the other for later, to keep my strategy flexible.\n**Plotting final strategies**\n\nIf I win in the final hand, there's no bonus, but winning earlier gets me more money. I do have Acrobat, which only applies to the final hand. Right now, I’m considering playing my pair of 8s with a multiplier. However, I realize I need to win with a stronger hand, like a full house, but that doesn't seem possible with my current cards. So, I’ll just play a single 2 as my high card for now. I can hold off on discarding anything right now and keep my options for later, especially for activating Mystic during the final hand. My next action is to play the 2 for 91 chips.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [7]"}
