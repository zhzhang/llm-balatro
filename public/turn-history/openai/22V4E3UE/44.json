{"reasoning":"**Considering card selection**\n\nI should choose a card that's likely to stay in my hand, ideally a low-value one that isn't part of the hand types I typically play, like pairs or two pairs. The 2 of spades comes to mind since it's low and even, not contributing to the Odd Todd. Keeping it unplayed is best. Alternatively, I could go with the 4 of diamonds. I’ll apply the Chariot to the 2 of spades to enhance it to Steel permanently. Let’s move forward with that!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,2]"}
