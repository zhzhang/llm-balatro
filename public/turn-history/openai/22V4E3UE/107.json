{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm in a shop with $4, and I see The Sun tarot for $3, but the Rocket joker is beyond my budget at $6. The reroll costs $5, which I can't afford either. Should I buy The Sun? It converts cards into Hearts and might help with potential flushes later, but it leaves me with just $1 after the purchase. On the other hand, I can't use consumables in the battle, so I need to consider that too.\n**Evaluating scoring and purchases**\n\nMy scoring looks good with a two pair at level 4 and jokers involved. I'm getting decent multipliers from Abstract and Mystic without discards, and the recent two pair scored 29,808, which is likely enough for ante 5, but I need to reach ante 8. Selling a joker could help, but the Rocket costs 6, and I only have 4 right now. If I sell a Mystic, I'd have enough to buy Rocket, but I would be down a joker slot. Should I go for it? Rocket boosts round payouts.\n**Analyzing scoring dynamics**\n\nI'm realizing that selling a scoring joker could bring in money for upcoming rounds, but it might jeopardize my future scoring. Should I sell Odd Todd or Mystic? The Rocket doesn’t contribute to scoring, but I seem to score well with Abstract, Mystic, and Acrobat. \n\nLooking at my Two Pair, at level 4 it generates 80 chips, plus multipliers from other cards. If I use Odd Todd effectively, I can boost my scoring significantly. It's a balancing act!\n**Considering multipliers and strategy**\n\nAcrobat gives a triple multiplier in the final hand, which could be crucial for beating the blinds. Mystic is also likely important since its multiplier can enhance my scoring. Odd Todd adds chips but not multiplication, meaning both factors matter. \n\nCurrently, I’m at ante 5 and moving to the next boss. I need strong scoring to get through tough bosses, while having additional money could help with future purchases like planets or tarot cards. However, sacrificing a joker slot for the Rocket could be costly.\n**Deciding on joker and Rocket swap**\n\nI'm considering swapping out a joker for the Rocket, which would increase my income but lose the scoring effect of the removed joker. I have to decide between Hanging Chad, Odd Todd, or Mystic. Removing Odd Todd means a significant chip loss. Mystic's +15 multiplier is crucial, while Hanging Chad provides some synergy. My two pair has scored well, but I may not clear the ante 5 boss without strong scoring. \n\nBuying the Rocket could help fund future purchases, but I want to ensure I can still win without that joker. I could sell Hanging Chad for $2 to buy the Rocket, which seems the best option. I also need to think about interest and potential earnings at the end of the round, but buying the Rocket now could yield small but important benefits. After beating the boss, the payout increases, making immediate purchases more beneficial.\n**Planning for boss round and purchases**\n\nI need to make sure I can beat the boss blind without Hanging Chad, which plays a significant role in scoring. There may be debuffs on face cards during this round, but I can try to play more hands without relying too much on discards, especially since Mystic works better with zero discards. \n\nI think swapping Hanging Chad for the Rocket is a solid move for future income, even if it means starting with $0 afterward. To move forward, I’ll sell Hanging Chad first to prepare for the Rocket purchase. I’ll take action to sell joker 5 now.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
