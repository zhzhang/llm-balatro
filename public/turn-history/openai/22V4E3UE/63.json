{"reasoning":"**Reevaluating chip strategy**\n\nI'm considering whether Banner is really that important right now. My current build yields around 4k-5k chips per hand, but for the upcoming big boss, I might need more. Acrobat x3 on the final hand could really help. Mystic Summit offers a +15 multiplier if I have zero discards, which is something I can aim for. I need to think about whether to sell Square and Banner or Square and Odd Todd to fund Mystic instead. Odd Todd might provide more value when scoring odd cards.\n**Assessing card value and slots**\n\nI'm thinking about the value of Banner, which adds a deterministic 30 chips per discard. Typically, I start with 2 discards, meaning I get an additional 60 chips. On the other hand, Square only gives 8 chips, which isn't very impressive. Since I already have 5 jokers, I can't buy Mystic until I clear a slot by selling cards. I need to figure out which cards to sell. Selling Square and Abstract could let me buy Mystic while keeping 4 jokers.\n**Comparing card options**\n\nI realize that keeping Mystic could mean having 4 jokers and one slot open for later. But losing Abstract would decrease my multiplier by 3 per joker, since it currently gives +15 at 5 jokers. If I sell Square, I’d have 4 jokers, but Abstract would drop to +12. Mystic, though conditional, offers a +15 multiplier. I might consider selling Banner instead to maintain Abstract. But realistically, Mystic only helps if I manage zero discards, and I’d lose Banner’s benefit in the process.\n**Weighing card strategies**\n\nI'm thinking that Banner might not be as important if I'm planning to use discards effectively to improve my hand. But I can't afford anything without selling, and the shop only has Mystic and Buffoon. Selling Square could give me $3, which I could carry into future rounds for interest since I can’t buy anything now. Keeping Square might actually matter more than I thought, because it boosts Abstract's multiplier. With Square, Abstract offers +15; without it, I only get +12. That’s a noticeable difference!\n**Evaluating card selling strategies**\n\nSquare provides a net +3 multiplier and +8 chips, so maybe I shouldn't sell it. If I sell Square and Banner, I’d get $7 to buy Buffoon. However, losing Banner could cost me 60 chips. I wonder if it's better to keep Square to maintain Abstract’s scaling. Selling Square and Abstract gets Mystic but sacrifices chips. On the other hand, I could keep Abstract for its multiplier. Ultimately, I think selling Square and Banner seems best to get Mystic without hurting my multiplier too much!\n**Deciding on card sales**\n\nI'm weighing the sale of Banner and Square to afford Mystic, but I also consider keeping Odd Todd for its chip benefits. Selling Banner and another joker, like Abstract, allows me to buy Mystic but reduces my multiplier. Alternatively, selling Banner and buying the Buffoon pack offers new joker options without losing valuable cards. Mystic is appealing for the final hand synergy, but keeping five jokers may ultimately provide better multipliers. I believe focusing on Mystic's conditional +15 multiplier is a strong choice, so selling Banner will likely be necessary.\n**Evaluating Mystic vs Buffoon**\n\nWith Mystic and four jokers, I see Abstract providing a +12 multiplier. On the final hand with zero discards, Mystic adds +15 for a total of 32, resulting in a massive boost. However, using discards lowers my multiplier in early hands. Selling Banner seems necessary to buy Mystic, but I'd prefer keeping Odd Todd for its chip benefits. If I opt for the Buffoon pack, I could potentially gain a fifth joker. Mystic offers a guaranteed benefit, while Buffoon is a gamble. I think Mystic is worth it for its strategic synergy.\n**Deciding on sales for Mystic**\n\nI need to generate $5, which I can do by selling Banner and Square. Selling both will cost me two jokers, lowering Abstract’s multiplier by three. However, buying Mystic gives me a +15 when active, improving my targeted hand multiplier to +12. \n\nI’m considering starting by selling either Square or Banner first. Selling Banner gives $4, which allows me the option to buy Buffoon instead if needed. I’ll go with selling Banner first, so I’ll proceed with that action. I’ll issue the command to sell Banner.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
