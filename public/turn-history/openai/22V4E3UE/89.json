{"reasoning":"**Considering card purchases**\n\nOkay, I’m thinking about how we can reach $5 without spending too much. Right now, we have $4, and I know in the next rounds we’ll earn more. Spending that $4 might not yield any interest, so if we buy a pack, it could help, but adding a random card might affect our consistency. I could choose from three options, aiming for high-value cards. Even though the standard pack likely offers basic cards, it might provide editions too. I’m leaning towards buying one standard pack to see if we can find enhanced cards. So let’s go ahead with the action to buy the booster pack!\n**Arranging jokers and buying packs**\n\nI have exactly $4, so I'll proceed once the pack opens. I notice the command list includes buy_booster, and I’ll start with the first standard pack. I’m also thinking about rearranging the jokers since their current order is Odd Todd, Abstract, Mystic, Acrobat, and Hanging Chad. It seems that the order of jokers can influence scoring for retriggers. Although Hanging Chad is an \"On scored\" joker and likely doesn't need rearranging, I’m considering placing it to the left of Odd Todd for clarity.\n**Understanding joker interactions**\n\nI realized Odd Todd gives +31 chips when scored, acting as an \"On scored\" joker that triggers each time a card scores. With Hanging Chad, which retriggers the first card, the order really does matter. During scoring, if Odd Todd appears before Hanging Chad, the sequence would apply the jokers left-to-right. However, even if Hanging Chad comes after Odd Todd, it still retriggers the entire scoring process, ensuring Odd Todd’s effect happens each time. So it seems safe to keep the current arrangement for now.\n**Deciding joker order for scoring**\n\nI’m considering whether Hanging Chad should be first among the \"on scored\" jokers. If it triggers as a retrigger, it might do so after all other scoring checks. To maximize its effect, it seems ideal if it retriggers after all additive chips. However, since the retrigger replicates the sequence from base chips through to jokers, the order of jokers mainly affects how effects apply. Since Hanging Chad doesn’t add chips and just triggers a retrigger, I think I’ll stick with the original plan and proceed to buy the booster pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
