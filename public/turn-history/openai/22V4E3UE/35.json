{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m at a shop with $2, which limits my buying choices. I can’t afford the Hanged Man for $3 or the Booster for $4, but I should consider selling something to buy the Hanged Man. It could help thin my deck by destroying up to 2 cards. Selling a Joker could bring in $2 or $3, and I’m weighing whether it’s better to lose some scaling with Abstract, which gives a multiplier boost based on Jokers.\n**Assessing card options**\n\nSo, I’m considering my card options: Banner adds chips, Turtle Bean increases hand size, Odd Todd contributes chips for odds, and Marble adds stones. I currently have the max of 5 jokers. Selling Turtle Bean might help since it's decaying, but it has its benefits. Selling Marble feels risky since I just bought it. While the Hanged Man could help remove low cards, I might just want to keep my money and let interest grow instead. It's tricky, though, because removing ranks could increase my chances of getting pairs.\n**Deciding on the next action**\n\nI’ve realized I need to save some money to buy packs later, but I can’t right now. Moving on to the next round will earn me some money and interest, which seems like a better option. So, the plan is to proceed with “round_select.” I’ll return the JSON with the action as “round_select.” This way, I can set myself up for better opportunities in the next round!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
