{"reasoning":"**Deciding on resource use**\n\nI'm considering buying Mars for free, which could be profitable later. However, since I already have Mercury, I should think about utilizing it now. Using Mercury will make it disappear, but it might be beneficial to wait for better scaling. On the flip side, leveling Mercury now could boost my score. So, I should probably use it to level up, which will improve my base chips. Plus, I'll still have room for Mars!\n**Considering actions for gameplay**\n\nI have Odd Todd and Steel 2 spades, so I'm thinking about adding more odd ranks. There are three options in the standard pack to choose from after buying. My first thought is to use Mercury now, but I could also buy Mars first to fill my inventory. If I buy Mars and then use Mercury later, that could work too. However, since we just finished the Big Blind and will face a Boss next, upgrading with Mercury now seems like the best move!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
