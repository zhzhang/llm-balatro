{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm exploring what to buy in the shop before the boss arrives, as I have $13. There's a \"Strength\" consumable for $2, which increases the rank of selected cards, and for $3, I could get the Crafty Joker, which gives +80 chips if my hand contains a Flush. Since I have 6 jokers, I need to consider if I should sell some to buy Crafty. Given my strategy is based on Flush and Straight Flush, Crafty seems like a good investment!\n**Comparing joker options**\n\nI'm comparing my existing jokers: Four Fingers is essential, while the Green Joker scales as I play more hands. To the Moon is good for the economy, and Mystic Summit offers a bonus when there are zero discards. The Scholar gives an ace bonus, but its activation is less frequent. I’m thinking that Crafty is more consistent, always triggering with a Flush. With that in mind, I’m likely to replace Scholar with Crafty, focusing on scoring over survival. I also need to consider To the Moon's interest benefits!\n**Reassessing game strategy**\n\nIn the game, it looks like the interest typically maxes out at $5, but To the Moon offers an additional $1 for every $5 without a cap, which might be pretty beneficial! Crafty Joker costs $3, and if I sell Scholar, I’ll gain $1 and still have enough to buy it with my $13. Mystic Summit is reliable, and while Green Joker's +4 multiplier seems small now, it can grow significantly. I think I’ll keep Green for scaling, and even though Showman provides an extra slot, it’s a negative edition.\n**Considering joker management**\n\nRight now, I’m at max capacity with 5 jokers and Showman, which doesn’t contribute to scoring. I could drop Showman and sell it for $3 to buy Crafty, achieving a net gain while fitting within the 5 jokers limit. However, I wonder if Showman’s duplicates might help me find better jokers or planets. Interestingly, the negative edition technically adds to capacity by occupying a slot, making it tricky. In this case, it counts against my max of 6. So, maybe it’s worth holding onto after all!\n**Deciding on joker sales**\n\nI’m figuring out how the negative Showman interacts with my joker count. It seems to count against my total but also adds a slot, resulting in a net effect of zero. I'm leaning toward crafting Joker for better scoring, and I need to consider selling either Scholar or To the Moon. Scholar seems weaker, so I might sell it to free up a slot for Crafty. However, I want to take action now, so the next step is to sell Joker 6 first. After that, I can focus on buying.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [6]"}
