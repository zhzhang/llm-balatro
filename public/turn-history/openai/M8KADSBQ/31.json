{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop offerings**\n\nI’m at a shop with $4 to spend. The Tower tarot card is $3, but the Raised Fist joker is $5, which I can’t afford. The Arcana packs are $4. I currently have three jokers: Four Fingers, which helps with a flush or straight, and Green Joker with scaling multipliers. I'm weighing the Tower tarot card since it could give me a Stone card, granting 50 chips, but it might complicate hand scoring since it lacks a rank or suit.\n**Clarifying stone cards in Balatro**\n\nIn Balatro, I need to understand stone cards better. They automatically score 50 chips when selected, but they don't contribute to rank or suit in hand composition. Even though they’re not counted for making a poker hand, they still play a role in scoring. So, when I play a stone card, the highest hand type is determined by the other cards, but the stone does score 50 chips as part of the played cards.\n**Understanding stone card participation**\n\nIf the stone card has no rank or suit, it seems unlikely that it participates in the hand for Balatro. However, stone cards always score 50 chips, which makes it a bit confusing. They seem to count as \"in hand\" for scoring purposes, even though they don't affect the hand type. The system indicates that \"+chips from selected cards are counted only if they are part of the highest hand,\" but special effects may override this, allowing the stone card to maintain its chip value. Plus, the Tower tarot card enhances one selected card into stone.\n**Deciding between purchases**\n\nAt the shop, I realize that I can’t use the “buy_and_use_consumable” command if it requires a target, like the Tower does. So I’d need to buy the card first and then use it in a later round. The buy_card action would add it to my consumables inventory for future use. Unfortunately, I can’t use the Tower immediately because I need a target card in hand, which I don't have right now. With only $4, I could buy the Tower for $3, leaving just $1. But the Arcana pack, costing $4, would offer more immediate options, potentially providing a useful tarot or upgrade.\n**Choosing the best purchase in the shop**\n\nI’m considering that immediate usage of tarot might require targets, and in the shop, I'll need to select cards from my deck. However, I believe tarot cards often need a target, so I can't use certain cards immediately without a hand. The Arcana pack states it can be used right away, possibly offering tarots that don't need targets. Given the risk, buying the Arcana Pack seems best since it can generate money or increase my options. So, I’ll choose to buy the Arcana Pack with my $4!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
