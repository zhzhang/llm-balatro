{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI'm considering our build, which involves Four Fingers, Green scaling, and the To the Moon economy. Mystic Summit gives a huge multiplier with no discards, and Gluttonous is part of the plan. We're relying on flushes and straights, particularly straight flushes. \n\nI think it makes sense to take the negative showman for an extra slot, allowing for more jokers. The Scholar is on sale for $3 and might help with Aces, especially since we have a few in the deck. Still, I'd be careful about how well it synergizes with our flush strategy.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI think I'm going to buy the Scholar card, and I’m also considering the booster packs. The Celestial pack costs $3 and allows me to choose a planet to use immediately. It feels like a good choice since it could help level up a straight flush, especially if I get a planet like Neptune. \n\nThe plan is to spend the $25 wisely: first, I need to buy the Showman for free as my initial action. Then I can purchase the Scholar and the Celestial pack sequentially.\n**Preparing the next action**\n\nAfter I buy the Showman, I think we'll increase our joker capacity, likely up to 6 or 7, which is great since it doesn’t use a slot. Since only one action is requested, I’ll focus on buying the card at position 1.\n\nNow, I'm crafting the final output JSON which will include the action to \"buy_card\" for that specific position. It’s simple but feels like a solid next step in our game strategy!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
