{"reasoning":"**Considering game mechanics**\n\nIn Balatro, chips modify chips, and multipliers modify multipliers, and they apply separately. The order of operations could matter if multipliers depend on chips. Crafty adds chips while Mystic multiplies. They happen independently from left to right, resulting in final chips multiplied by the multiplier. Actually, additions to chips are always additive, so the order doesn't really matter. However, placing \"To the Moon\" last doesn’t affect scoring. Regarding the boss, if cards are face down, I can't see them initially, but I can still select them?\n**Planning the next move**\n\nThis makes discarding a bit trickier. I might consider playing a safe hand, like a flush with four cards, but I'm not sure if I can choose that yet. I'll need to handle that in the round. So, the action should be play_round. I need to provide estimated chips, and in the response format, an action is required, along with an optional intended hand type, which could be null for now. I think I'll go with play_round for now.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
