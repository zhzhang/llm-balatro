{"reasoning":"**Selecting planet cards**\n\nI just unpacked a celestial pack with three planet cards: Mercury, Neptune, and Uranus. I'm leaning towards selecting Neptune since it contributes to a strong hand, enhancing my straight flush with an additional multiplier. Mercury would improve my pair, but it often scores low, while Uranus offers a two pair. For my output, I need a JSON format for the action \"select,\" targeting position 2. I'll set intended_hand_type and estimated_chips as null. Let's finalize that!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
