{"reasoning":"**Deciding on discards**\n\nI’m thinking: if I discard 7H, I can still keep 7c for potential pairs. But ideally, I want a flush. I also need to discard positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. After that, my new hand will have four new cards plus the current clubs. To play a flush, at least one of those new cards should be a club. If not, I’ll rely on my existing four clubs. So, let’s discard cards 1, 2, 3, and 4 first to improve my hand!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4]"}
