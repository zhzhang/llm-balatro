{"reasoning":"**Evaluating stencil purchase strategy**\n\nI think buying a stencil could help with scaling, as we can later sell other jokers to boost our empties while keeping the stencil. If we buy now, we need to fill slots effectively. Selling some, like Crafty and perhaps To the Moon, could work, but I might want to keep To the Moon for the economy. With ante 5, scaling may be necessary to win. The stencil seems to offer significant potential for multiplication, which could be quite beneficial.\n**Analyzing empty slot strategy**\n\nTo achieve xmult greater than 1, I need to create empties. If I buy a stencil, I could immediately sell To the Moon and Crafty to free up two slots, giving me a total of 2 empties. Keeping Four Fingers, Mystic Summit, and Joker Stencil might be a good choice, but Showman could conflict with the stencil since it occupies a slot. If I keep Showman, I can reach a max of 6 slots, which allows for more empties. However, selling Showman and Crafty could leave me with three jokers and three empties, increasing the multiplier.\n**Evaluating joker and showman strategy**\n\nIf I sell Showman, my maximum slots become 5, and with three remaining jokers, I have two empties, resulting in a multiplier of 3. However, keeping Showman could allow for four jokers, reaching a max of 6 slots, giving me two empties and also benefiting from Showman's effect. But maybe that effect isn't crucial for maximizing the xmult. If I keep Showman and include Stencil, Four Fingers, and possibly To the Moon, I’ll have five jokers with just one empty slot, which suggests I need to reevaluate the formula for calculating xmult based on my current scenario.\n**Understanding the xmult calculation**\n\nIt seems that the game calculates empties based on the maximum achievable after purchasing and including the stencil. The \"Currently x1\" in the shop suggests a simulation of the immediate effect based on current empty slots. If I buy now with all six jokers filled, there would be zero empties, leading to an x1 multiplier. The likely formula could be the number of empty slots after purchase plus one. So, if I have five jokers, including the stencil, with one empty slot, it gives me an x2 multiplier. This setup can happen if I manage my jokers accordingly!\n**Deciding on the stencil purchase**\n\nSince I currently have 5 jokers, buying the stencil will fill my slots to 6 unless I sell one afterward. If I buy and sell Crafty immediately, I can keep four jokers and achieve an x2 multiplier with one empty slot. However, Crafty does offer benefits, providing +80 chips on a flush. \n\nUltimately, I can buy the stencil with my available funds, leaving no empties but setting up for a strategy later. My next immediate action: buy the Joker Stencil.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
