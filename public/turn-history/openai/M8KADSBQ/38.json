{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nWe're in a shop with $5 and need to make decisions. I'm considering options like the Neptune planet for a straight flush level-up, Mystic Summit joker, and some boosters. We have 3 jokers and can hold 5. The Green Joker synergizes well, and the Four Fingers helps with straights and flushes. Mystic Summit offers a +15 multiplier when we have no discards left, but using all discards costs a bit. It’s a balancing act with potential net gains.\n**Considering options in the shop**\n\nMystic Summit seems promising, but it requires using all discards to activate. I wonder if it’s better to keep some discards to aim for a flush or straight since discarding early is common. Guaranteeing zero discards means I might have to discard everything each round, which could be unnecessary. However, that +15 multiplier early on is substantial. Alternatively, I could buy the Celestial or Arcana pack for $4, which provides an immediate planet or tarot that might be helpful.\n**Analyzing purchase decisions**\n\nNeptune for $3 may not be very effective since a straight flush is rare, but with Four Fingers, I could potentially create a 4-card straight flush more easily. That level-up gives +40 chips and a +4 multiplier for straight flushes, which could be helpful if I manage to achieve them occasionally. Alternatively, To the Moon offers extra interest on $5 at the end. If I buy Mystic Summit, I’ll end with $0 and miss out on interest. If I get Neptune and keep $2, there’s still no interest. Buying a booster for $4 leaves me with $1.\n**Assessing financial options and deck strength**\n\nI can't afford the reroll cost of $5 right now. It might be better to save for interest. To the Moon offers an extra $1 interest for each $5, so with $5, I’d get a total of $2 interest at the end of the next round. However, I need power to handle the upcoming ante 2 and ante 3 bosses. My current deck lacks enhancements except for the $3♣, which I think I played as a multiplier earlier. The Mystic Summit is a strong common joker, so buying it could be worth it, but I need a solid discard strategy too.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m considering using discards early and then playing a final big hand with zero discards. The Green Joker loses multiplier with each discard, but if I discard four to reach zero, I gain a +15 boost, creating a net increase. I can rebuild the Green Joker's multiplier by playing more hands. \n\nBuying Mystic Summit makes sense for immediate power, but it uses up my funds completely. Alternatively, I could buy the Celestial Pack for a chance at powerful planets like Saturn or Jupiter, which would enhance my flushes and straights. Mystic Summit seems more consistent, but I think I’m leaning towards getting the Celestial Pack. After considering my options, I’ll go ahead and buy Mystic Summit.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
