{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a shop voucher**\n\nI’m in a shop with just one item on clearance: a $10 voucher. I have $30 and no boosters. Buying the voucher seems smart since it could lower costs for future shop visits and rerolls. I’m weighing if I should reroll the shop for jokers or consumables instead, but that costs $5. It might not reduce prices for rerolls, only for cards, but in the end, buying the voucher still feels worthwhile. So, I’ll go ahead and buy the voucher!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
