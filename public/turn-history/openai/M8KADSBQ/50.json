{"reasoning":"**Executing play_round**\n\nI’m focusing on playing a round, and I estimate the chips needed to be around 2000. I believe I can achieve that with hands like straight, flush, or straight flush. Using Four Fingers will make getting a 4-card straight flush easier. Plus, we have a Lovers consumable to create a wild card, but I can't use it before the round starts because it requires a target in hand during blind selection. So, I'll proceed with play_round now.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
