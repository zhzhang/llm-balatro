{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip values**\n\nI’m figuring out how to count empty slots based on the total number of slots and jokers involved. If I have 5 total slots and 2 jokers, that leaves me with 3 empty slots. I need to reach 11,000 total chips across up to 4 hands, and it’s possible to win with multiple hands.\n\nCurrently, I’m looking at a hand with specific cards that may allow for strong plays. I’m interested in calculating the potential values based on the combinations I can form.\n**Calculating potential chip values**\n\nI’m determining that my total chips are 2,128, which isn’t huge. Looking for a flush, I see I can use my 9♣, 7♣, and 6♣, but I need one more club, and I only have three. Four Fingers requires four for a flush, so it's not an option here. \n\nI found a pair with my 9♣ and 9♦, which gives me 43 chips in total. While I don’t have a strong current hand, I can play small hands and draw new cards to aim for stronger combos like a straight flush. I'm considering strategies to maximize my chances of drawing valuable cards.\n**Planning for a higher chip total**\n\nI’m thinking about how we need 11,000 chips. A typical straight flush at level 2 gives around 7,000, so aiming for another straight flush seems viable. With Four Fingers, I can make it easier by needing just four cards of any suit. \n\nIf I can get one straight flush worth about 7,000 and another hand around 4,000, that should help reach our target. I’m calculating potential multipliers, including the jokers and other enhancements, to reach the 11,000 mark. If I adjust my card values slightly, I think I can tip the total over!\n**Determining high card strategies**\n\nTo clear in one hand, I really need strong high cards for a straight flush, especially using my multiplier card. Currently, I have the 9♣, which could contribute to a straight flush if I can get the 6♣, 7♣, and 8♣. \n\nI see that if I include the 10♣, I can create a stronger sequence with 7-8-9-10 clubs, but it still doesn’t reach 11,000 chips. However, aiming for 9-10-J-Q looks promising, potentially pushing my total over the target! I’m realizing that focusing on those high cards is essential.\n**Deciding on hand strategy**\n\nI’m aiming for a hand with high cards, specifically looking at 10♣, J♣, and Q♣, but I need to draw these since I don’t have them. I want to keep my clubs (6♣, 7♣, 9♣) to help build future straight flushes. \n\nTo cycle my non-club cards, I’ll play 5 non-club cards, which might give me a high card score. The estimated total is 480 chips, which isn’t a lot, but it allows me to draw new cards and hopefully get closer to my goal of 11,000 chips. I’ll play cautiously and focus on maximizing my hand potential.\n**Calculating chip score**\n\nI scored with my highest card, the 10♥, earning +10 chips, but sadly, the other cards don’t contribute anything. So, that gives me a total of 15 chips. I apply the multipliers: I have Mystic Summit, which adds +15, boosting my multiplier to 16. Then, the Stencil doubles that, making it 32.\n\nMy final chip count is 480. Now, I’ll input the action as JSON, detailing the play positions for the cards I'm using while making sure not to create any pairs or straights by accident. I'll go ahead and proceed with this plan!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,8]"}
