{"reasoning":"**Considering card purchasing strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about the synergy between Bootstraps and To the Moon. Bootstraps gives a multiplier with more money, and To the Moon helps maintain high money levels through interest. Since I can't afford Bootstraps now, it seems wise to buy To the Moon first to build money quickly and then get Bootstraps later. Alternatively, I could buy the Celestial pack for $4, but I'd prioritize To the Moon to ensure compounding benefits sooner. Action: buy_card 2 (To the Moon).\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
