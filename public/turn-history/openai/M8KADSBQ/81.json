{"reasoning":"**Making card selection**\n\nI'm in the standard pack selection process and need to pick a card for my deck. I've got a few options: 3 hearts vanilla, 2 clubs vanilla, or the 9 of clubs with a mult enhancement. The mult-enhanced 9 of clubs stands out since it’s strong and synergizes with the Gluttonous Joker, boosting club scores. Even if I don't end up with clubs, this mult card is useful in many scored hands. So, I’m choosing the 9 of clubs!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
