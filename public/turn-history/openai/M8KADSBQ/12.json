{"reasoning":"**Analyzing gameplay decisions**\n\nI see a downside where having a hand size reduction can make finding combos trickier, but I think I can manage with more discards.

The position for that would be pack_card_position 2, so I should use the command to select 2.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
