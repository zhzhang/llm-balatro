{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip estimates**\n\nI'm figuring out how playing 5 cards with extras doesn't add to the chip count if they’re not part of the hand. But can I play just 4? I need to estimate the chips. So looking at an alternative hand, like a flush with 4 hearts, we currently have J♥, 9♥, 7♥, and 6♥. That's a flush worth 67 chips when multiplying. \n\nBut a straight flush could be better with a base value of 100 and a total of 130 chips. Let's keep comparing!\n**Selecting cards for scoring**\n\nOkay, I've calculated the total to be 3120, which is over 2000, so that’s great! I need to use the Lovers on 8♣ to make it wild. Then, I’m thinking of playing the cards 6♥, 7♥, 9♥, and 8♣. \n\nAh, but for a straight flush, all the cards must be the same suit. So, it looks like I'll use the indices 4, 5, 6, and 8 for scoring, which gives me 9♥, 7♥, 6♥, and 8♣. The order doesn't matter!\n**Considering card contributions**\n\nI need to think carefully about how a straight flush requires 4 cards, but maybe having a 5th card could help. However, only the cards in the best hand actually score points. If I add J♥, it doesn't improve my hand since the best is still the straight flush with the four cards I have.  \n\nThe J♥ won't score anything. I’m wondering if we could turn 10♠ wild to form a straight, but I need all cards to be the same suit. It's tricky!\n**Determining next action**\n\nAlright, I see that unless I ignore suits, I can't create a straight with 6-7-8-9-10 using 10♠. I could use the 8♣, but that doesn't help me much unless it’s wild. \n\nThe best option really is to use the wild 8 for a straight flush. So the next action is to use the consumable to turn 8♣ wild. That’s my immediate step. I’ll format this as: action, positions, intended_hand_type null, estimated_chips null.\n**Defining consumable positions**\n\nI'm confirming that for the `use_consumable` action, the positions should include [1, 8]. This means I’m specifying the position of the consumable as well as the target card position. \n\nSo, I'll keep it simple: I just need to present those two integers in the schema. This will help ensure clarity in the action I’m taking. Alright, I feel good about that!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,8]"}
