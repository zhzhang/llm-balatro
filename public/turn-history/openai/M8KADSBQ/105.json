{"reasoning":"**Analyzing joker strategy**\n\nI’m in a shop with $2, and the Wily Joker costs $2. But getting it would fill an empty slot, reducing my Joker Stencil from X2 to X1, which probably isn't worth it. The Wily Joker gives +100 chips for a three-of-a-kind, while I'm focusing on flushes or straight flushes. I’ve played straight flush five times, so I’ll skip the Wily. Selling jokers could create more empty slots for the stencil. I can have six jokers max, but I need to keep key cards for their effects.\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nTo the Moon provides extra interest, and selling it could create two empty slots for a Stencil X3. This might cause an economic loss, but it could be worth it for ante 5 scaling. My cash flow is low, but To the Moon helps generate interest. However, maximizing the xmult is crucial for beating blinds. I need to consider the order of jokers since their independent triggers operate from left to right. I should place Mystic before Stencil for optimization. Rearranging them might be beneficial.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI’ve placed Mystic before Stencil, so that's set. It seems like it's time to leave the shop and move to round selection. However, I’m considering using the Devil consumable, which enhances a selected card. But since I don’t have any cards in hand right now, that won't work. Selling To the Moon could improve my score by increasing the xmult from X2 to X3, which is a 50% increase. I need to think about surviving ante 5 and scaling to ante 8 eventually.\n**Evaluating joker management**\n\nI’m thinking it through: if I can still beat the blinds with an X2, I should keep my economy in place. Selling Showman could be an option, but it has a negative effect while granting an extra slot. However, negative Jokers actually increase the maximum limit by 1 but still take a slot, which doesn't change my empty slots. If I sell Showman, my max would drop to 5 jokers, leaving just one empty slot while my Stencil remains at X2. It's also worth noting that selling it would provide $2 more, but the impact of its duplicates isn't critical.\n**Deciding on Showman**\n\nSelling Showman may be worthwhile to regain some cash while keeping my X2 multiplier. Showman sells for $2, giving me a total of $4, but rerolling isn't an option right now. If I sell Showman, I can buy Wily, but that leaves me with no empty slots. Maintaining Showman increases my max joker count without impacting my empty slots, which is beneficial for my Stencil. However, if I give up Showman, I lose some ability for duplicates. Selling seems advantageous for immediate cash, and I can always keep it for later if needed!\n**Analyzing Showman's utility**\n\nIt sounds like Showman does indeed occupy a slot but increases the maximum joker capacity by 1. When considering empty slots, selling it won't change my total empties but will yield some cash and eliminate duplicates. However, keeping Showman might be worth it since it practically counts as free capacity. It helps in bringing duplicates of crucial jokers, like Stencils, which could boost my multipliers. Given all this, my next move will be to proceed with round selection while aiming to play without discards to maximize my multipliers.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
