{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card possibilities**\n\nI’m currently selecting a hand in the small blind, and I need 11,000. From the remaining cards—J♥, 2♥, K♣, 9♣, 7♣, 6♣, J♦, and 10♦—I’ve got four hands and three discards left. I see I can make a flush with four clubs (K, 9, 7, 6) but not a straight. For a straight flush, I’d need cards in the same suit in sequence, but I can only try for potential straights or flushes with the remaining discards.\n**Calculating potential wins**\n\nI’m thinking about the 11,000 threshold I need to reach. Maybe I could achieve it in two hands by getting a straight flush worth 7,000 plus another scoring hand. However, I currently don’t have a straight flush. I’ll use my discards to search for suited connectors. Since I have four clubs, I could aim for a flush hand for some chips, but I still likely need straight flushes to get over the threshold, ideally two of them. Plus, using all discards can help boost my multiplier.\n**Analyzing straight flush potential**\n\nI need four specific cards to form a straight flush, and only those cards will count. I'm thinking a four-card straight flush would sum to 180 chips if I can get the right high cards, with a mult base of 12. The Mystic Summit can boost my multiplier by 15, but only if I have zero discards. However, even with these calculations, the total would only be 9,720, which doesn’t meet the 11,000 requirement. It seems like even a strong straight flush may not cut it in one hand.\n**Considering scoring strategies**\n\nI’m realizing that I might need at least two hands to reach a better chip total. If I aim for a five-card straight flush, including higher cards like an Ace might help boost my chips. However, even with a strong five-card straight flush, my calculations show I’d only reach 10,206 chips, which still isn’t enough. It seems better to use my discards wisely before scoring big, potentially triggering Mystic Summit’s boost. I could start with a flush using my four clubs and save the discards for later if needed.\n**Planning optimal discards**\n\nI need to be careful not to waste any potential for a straight flush. With four hands, I can use my discards strategically to improve my hand composition, focusing on the clubs I've got. Currently, I can play a flush that might yield 67 chips, but that's quite low.\n\nI'll prioritize discarding my non-clubs—specifically J♥, 2♥, J♦, and 10♦—and keep my clubs. This will maximize my chance of drawing key cards like 8♣ and 10♣ for a straight flush. After discarding, I'll assess my new hand and decide on further actions accordingly.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
