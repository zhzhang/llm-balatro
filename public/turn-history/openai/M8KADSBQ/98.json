{"reasoning":"**Analyzing spectral options**\n\nI’m thinking about the spectral mechanics here. The joker has polychrome effects, while the Ankh duplicates it. I notice the spectral pack offers various options, including some compelling entities like Aura and Wraith. The Showman allows for duplicates, and I should consider that alongside the discounts. With a $13 budget, I’m inclined to buy The Devil now. Buying the jumbo spectral pack later for $3 sounds smart as well, hoping for strong options like hex or cryptid. Rerolling the shop could also be a consideration after these purchases!\n**Deciding on a purchase**\n\nI see that both cards are available in the shop. To maximize my strategy, buying The Devil seems like the best choice since it’s low-cost with no downsides. I'll use the command to purchase it—buy_card 2—and it will go straight into my consumables inventory, which feels like a smart move for now. Let’s go ahead and do that! This should benefit my next steps without complicating things.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
