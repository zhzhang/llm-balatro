{"reasoning":"**Calculating scoring for hands**\n\nI’m evaluating the scoring based on the latest values. I noted that the updated value used after increment is good for straight and chip calculations. I see that I have a potential straight with four cards, leading to a base of 69 chips. With multipliers applied, the total chips come to 483. Now for the next hand: I’m looking for possibilities like three of a kind or pairs, and I could even form a full house with 4s and 8s!\n**Finalizing full house play**\n\nI’m working on confirming that I have the right hand for a full house. I found the necessary pair of 8s and three of a kind with 4s, which adds up to a total of 68 chips. With a multiplier of 8, my total score comes to 544. This easily exceeds the requirement. I’ll play the full house as a 5-card hand without needing to discard anything. Playing these cards will get me to a chip total of 1222, which is great!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,5,7]"}
