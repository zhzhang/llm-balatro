{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker strategy**\n\nI’m considering selling a non-negative joker, aiming to maintain a count of five with a max of six. Crafty seems tempting for the x2 bonus, but it also offers +80 chips on flush, which isn't a huge gain compared to doubling multipliers. To the Moon supports our economy, but selling it means losing the interest bonus. I’m weighing the options to sell Crafty while holding onto To the Moon for future needs. Keeping key jokers may be necessary as well!\n**Assessing joker options**\n\nTo the Moon provides an economic advantage, while Crafty offers chips. Showman seems unnecessary, mainly used for allowing duplicates, but it might count as a joker, affecting my slot situation. However, if I sell another joker to create an empty slot, it won't impact my empties count. It's clear Showman doesn't affect the number of available empties directly. Selling Crafty would leave me with five jokers and $2, allowing for a potential Wily purchase, which gives +100 chips for three of a kind.\n**Deciding on joker sales**\n\nMy strategy focuses on achieving a straight flush, so the chip bonus isn’t essential right now. It's better to keep an empty slot for an x2 multiplier rather than fill it with Wily, as buying Wily would reduce my empty slots to zero, limiting the stencil multiplier to x1. It seems like Wily doesn't provide significant advantages, so I'll sell Crafty to create an empty slot for the x2 multiplier. However, I also need to weigh selling To the Moon or Mystic Summit instead, since maintaining my economy is critical for future rerolls and pack purchases.\n**Arranging jokers for optimal strategy**\n\nThe Stencil x2 multiplier will likely provide more value, so keeping it is essential. Four Fingers seems crucial, confirming that selling Crafty is the right decision. After selling, I need to consider the arrangement of the jokers since their order really matters, especially for independent categories. The additive multiplier, like Mystic Summit’s +15, should come before the multiplicative multipliers, like the Joker Stencil, to maximize the final outcome. Given that we’re creating an empty slot, I can rearrange later, focusing on the order of Four Fingers, Mystic Summit, and Joker Stencil for now.\n**Finalizing joker arrangement**\n\nI’m considering rearranging the jokers to optimize my strategy. I think putting Mystic Summit to the immediate left of Stencil works well. Right now, my order is Four Fingers, To the Moon, Mystic Summit, Showman, Crafty, and then Stencil. After selling Crafty, it will be: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Mystic Summit, Showman, and Stencil. This setup keeps Mystic Summit before Stencil, which is great. I'll proceed with the action of selling Crafty and respond with the JSON Action for that.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
