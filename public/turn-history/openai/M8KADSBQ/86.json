{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nI need to figure out our next move in the shop. We sold a Scholar and have five jokers and $14 left. The Crafty Joker is available for $3, and the Strength tarot for $2. The Crafty Joker gives +80 chips when we have a Flush, which should also activate with a straight flush, so that’s a solid option for generating chips. With the Four Fingers helping us build flushes or straights, buying Crafty seems straightforward. I'm leaning toward that option!\n**Weighing card options**\n\nSo, the Strength tarot requires me to select up to two cards from my hand when used. If I buy it, it goes into consumables, which I can use later. But with only two consumable slots and none currently filled, I might want to hold off. I could buy Strength after Crafty for $2, but it may not significantly help. I feel like buying Crafty for its +80 chips when I have a Flush is a solid move!\n**Clarifying card mechanics**\n\nIt looks like the scoring isn't tied to a specific moment but seems to be independent instead. In Balatro, a lot of chip jokers work during the independent step, which is category 5. I don't think the order matters for other independent effects. Mystic Summit is independent, Green applies on played cards, and Four Fingers is passive. To the Moon affects the end of the round, while Showman is also passive. So it seems the best action is to buy the Crafty Joker!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
