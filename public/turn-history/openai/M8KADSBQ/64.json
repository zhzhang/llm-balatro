{"reasoning":"**Deciding on rerolls**\n\nI’m in a shop that’s empty with $20. I need to decide whether to reroll at a cost of $5 or move on since there are no items available. Rerolling could help me find jokers or consumables, and I have a strong economy going with \"To the Moon\" and a gold seal Ace. It seems wise to reroll at least once or twice for scaling multipliers. Still, I have to think about replacing weaker jokers if needed and consider the other implications on my game.\n**Evaluating shop decisions**\n\nSo, I think we’re in round 6, and now it's time for a blind select on the ante of 4. Being in the shop after round 6 means I must've beaten some blind, maybe even a big one. I can afford rerolls to find better jokers or vouchers. The Clearance Sale voucher can lower card costs by 25% but doesn't affect the reroll cost. With $20, I'm getting $8 per round from interest, plus potential scoring. Spending $5 to reroll seems reasonable despite the risk. I should definitely take a chance on it!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
