{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm in a shop, and I have $0, so I can't buy anything really, except the spectral pack for $8 and a telescope for $10 — neither of which I can afford. I’m thinking about whether I should sell the joker, but it’s not worth it since I’d only get $3 or $2, which still isn't enough. Rerolling costs $5, and I can’t manage that either. So, I guess I'll just proceed to round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
