{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card counts**\n\nI have 4♠ and 4♣ in hand, so that's two 4s accounted for. The deck had one 4 remaining, which probably means there are three left in total. But maybe it’s actually just two? The 3s are different; with four in the deck initially, there are now three, leaving one in the deck. That suggests 3s appear more frequently, which could help form better hands. In Balatro, tarot modifies selected cards from the deck.\n**Selecting cards for enhancement**\n\nI’m deciding on which cards to enhance for a permanent multiplier boost. Enhancing King♦ and maybe 8♣ could be helpful, but I wonder which is more valuable. It seems like the multiplier (+4) would benefit high-frequency cards in hand, regardless of rank. I think I’d prefer to enhance duplicates for better pairs or trips. So, I might choose two of the 3s, like 3♠ and 3♣, specifically positions 2 and 6. I’ll select 1, 2, and 6 for the Empress card targets.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,2,6]"}
