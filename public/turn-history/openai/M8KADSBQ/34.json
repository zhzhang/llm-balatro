{"reasoning":"**Clarifying card enhancements**\n\nI see that the selected cards were enhanced to Mult cards, getting a +4 multiplier when scored. They appear to be 4♠, 3♠, and 3♣. However, Empress only enhances 2 cards, making my selection of 3 possibly invalid. The game state advanced to the shop, so it might have accepted the first two cards instead. It’s unclear which cards were enhanced. Now, I’m blind selecting, which leads to a Holographic Tag: a free Joker that gets a +10 multiplier. That's a strong advantage!\n**Evaluating gameplay choices**\n\nIf I skip, I lose the $4 reward and progress straight to the boss without getting a shop visit. That feels crucial since I currently have $0; I'll need funds for the shop. Skipping keeps me at $0 and launches me directly into a boss match requiring 1600 points, making it harder to compete. However, I’ll receive a free Joker at the next shop after beating the boss. The challenge will be whether I can beat the boss with my current strength, especially since I have guesswork involved in card selection.\n**Analyzing gameplay mechanics**\n\nIn Balatro, the boss \"The Blind\" might be similar to The Mask. One tricky aspect is that cards are drawn face down after each hand, which means I can't see their rank or suit immediately. However, I can still play them, which adds a layer of strategy, like trying to discard wisely. My scoring from previous hands was decent: full house at 544, straight at 483, and flush at 345. Given that I need 1600 points, achieving an average of 400 per hand seems feasible, but the face-down cards will complicate things!\n**Considering face-down mechanics and joker growth**\n\nI'm thinking that if new cards drawn after each hand are face-down, it might mean the current hand remains visible. After a hand is played, the replacements go face-down until the game ends. There's also the green joker to consider. Skipping the big blind means missing out on that $4 opportunity, which could enhance the joker’s multiplier. Playing hands boosts the multiplier too, while skipping offers a valuable holographic joker. I wonder if I can handle the boss without extra funds, but it's hard to say for sure.\n**Deciding on the big blind play**\n\nI realize winning the big blind could give me $4 to spend on the shop, potentially buying something like the Tower for the boss or the Arcana pack for different benefits. I think it’s worth considering how Raised Fist can enhance multipliers if I hold the lowest card rank. However, I need to weigh that against the risk of skipping the big blind, which would mean missing out on money and scaling. Given my current zero funds, it's probably safer to play and get prepared for the boss.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
