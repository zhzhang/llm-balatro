{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI'm considering the value of Four Fingers for creating a 4-card flush or straight, and how it synergizes with my strategy. The Green Joker's scaling is crucial, while To the Moon offers interest for each $5 but isn’t helpful for immediate scoring. Selling To the Moon for $2 could be an option, but it may not cover costs for Neptune or a pack. I’m weighing the idea of selling other cards, like Mystic or Green, but I’d lose valuable scaling. I’ll need to think this through carefully!\n**Assessing card options**\n\nI'm reconsidering whether to keep all my cards or sell some. To the Moon doesn't seem useful right now since I have $0, but it could be valuable later. Selling it now won’t give me much. If I sell To the Moon for $2, plus maybe the Green card, I could buy Neptune for $3. But Neptune tends to level straight flushes, which can be rare. Alternatively, selling To the Moon and Mystic Summit gives me $4 to buy a celestial pack, which might help me with the flush or straight planets!\n**Strategizing card play**\n\nI'm looking at how Mystic Summit offers a +15 multiplier if I discard nothing. I could strategize to discard all cards each round, but that would lower the Green Joker's multiplier, currently at +7. If I used all three discards, it becomes +4, but combining with Mystic's +15 gives a net of +19, which seems strong! So, I'll keep Mystic and proceed to the next action: round selection. I considered the order of triggering for Green Joker, but it turns out there’s no need to rearrange things right now. Let's go with the next blind selection!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
