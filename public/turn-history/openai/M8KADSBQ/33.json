{"reasoning":"**Rearranging joker order**\n\nI’m thinking about how we might want to rearrange the order of the jokers. In Balatro, order seems to matter for some characters, like Four Fingers, who feels more passive and independent. But I realized that it actually acts as a rule modifier. The Green Joker triggers \"on played\" before scoring, so I guess order among plays might only matter for that one. By the end of the round, To the Moon seems independent. So, perhaps the order doesn’t matter anymore, and I should just do round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
