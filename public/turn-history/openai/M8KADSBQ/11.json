{"reasoning":"**Considering shop options**\n\nAlright, I’m in the shop after beating the big blind. I have $8 and saw a few things I could possibly buy. There’s a joker called Four Fingers for $0, which is uncommon. The Green Joker and Buffoon pack both cost $4, but then there’s the Mega Spectral pack for $8, which lets me choose 2 of 4 spectral items instantly. I can’t afford the telescope voucher at $10, so I need to decide on my options!\n**Planning for next moves**\n\nI’m considering a $5 reroll. We should prepare for the upcoming boss blind in ante 1, but I don’t know the unknown boss effect yet, and I’ll find out in the round select. Strengthening our position is key. The Four Fingers joker is great for helping with straights and flushes early on, while the Green Joker scales with hands played, which could be useful since we use discards a lot. \n\nI could buy the Green Joker and the Buffoon pack for $8, which gives me flexibility with jokers. But should I get the Buffoon pack first to see what options I get?\n**Deciding on pack purchases**\n\nIt seems smarter to open the pack first and decide what to do next. Buying a booster uses an action, and I can't see the content beforehand. The Green Joker works well when playing many hands and discarding fewer, which might be an advantage since the early blinds are low. I could play extra hands to scale efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, the Mega Spectral pack could provide strong effects like Ankh or Hex, but it feels a bit unpredictable. Given the situation, I'll lean towards buying the Green Joker for consistent scaling and then the Buffoon pack for potential synergy, even if it leaves me with $0 for now.\n**Contemplating money management**\n\nI'm currently at $8 between blinds, and I need to think about interest after beating a blind. Since I've already beaten the big blind, I'm in the shop before the boss round. If I go into the boss fight with $8, my interest will be calculated based on what I keep afterward. \n\nI need to assess whether to hold onto some cash for the Telescope, which is great for consistency but seems essential to buy beforehand. Vouchers usually stay until purchased, but I can’t afford it now. If I save my money, I might have more to work with after the boss and could buy the Telescope later.\n**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI need to decide whether to buy the Green Joker now or save for the Telescope at the start of ante 2. The Telescope costs $10, but I could have enough even after buying the Green Joker for $4, leaving me with $4.\n\nI could buy the Green and still keep some cash for interest, while opening the Buffoon pack might leave me with nothing as a buffer. Given the unknown boss, I feel it's safer to buy the Green for scaling while retaining $4. \n\nBut if the Buffoon pack offers a strong multiplier, it could be worth considering first. I think I'll go ahead and buy the Buffoon pack for $4 and see what it provides before making any further decisions!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
