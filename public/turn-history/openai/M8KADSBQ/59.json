{"reasoning":"**Planning booster purchase**\n\nI'm in a shop with free boosters and a $10 voucher clearance sale. I should buy the free boosters first. When I open a booster pack, I choose one card, but the interface indicates I need to buy it first. I guess my next action will be to buy a Jumbo Arcana booster since it's free. The Arcana is great because I can use it right away without consuming a slot. So, I’ll go ahead and do that!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
