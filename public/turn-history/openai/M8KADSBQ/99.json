{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop purchase**\n\nI’m trying to figure out my next action in the shop. I have $12, and the options are the Green Joker for $2 and the Jumbo Spectral Pack for $3. I already have the max jokers, so I could consider selling something for the Green Joker since stacking could help with scaling, but I’m not playing many hands. The Spectral Pack could give me powerful random items for just $3, so I think I’ll go for that option!\n**Evaluating reroll and spending**\n\nI need to consider the reroll cost of $5 and how I could save for interest with \"To the Moon.\" Currently, I have $12. With \"To the Moon,\" it seems I could earn $2 interest for every $5, which could be double the base interest. However, there's also the immediate benefit from discounts, so spending might be wise. I’m also thinking about enhancing scoring over boosting my economy. If I buy a second Green Joker, it might impact my synergy by requiring me to sell something.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m considering selling \"To the Moon\" once my economy stabilizes, but I see that interest at ante 5 could really benefit me. However, scoring might get tight with higher antes. A second Green Joker could add multipliers for each hand played, especially since I plan to play multiple hands to build that multiplier. Still, we usually focus on straight or flush hands, which doesn't scale well. Buying the Jumbo Spectral Pack for $3 could give me strong additions like Immolate or Cryptid, and we have room for immediate use! I think I'll go for it!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
