{"reasoning":"**Analyzing multipliers**\n\nI’m looking at how the Green Joker affects multipliers. It seems to impact with \"+1 Mult per hand played\" and \"-1 Mult per discard,\" but I'm pondering if it's considered independent or tied to its play. It might be that during the \"on played\" phase, its value as a current multiplier is applied. I wonder: can the multiplier be negative? I'd prefer to avoid that by discarding first. Also, the order of effects seems critical!\n**Evaluating the Green Joker and multipliers**\n\nI’m thinking that the Green Joker's scaling might happen while it's played, affecting its current multiplier during its independent phase. The run metadata indicates \"Currently +0 Mult,\" so it changes with plays and discards. If I discard now, it drops to -1, but when I play the next hand, it corrects to 0, which means no penalty. \n\nFor Mystic Summit, +15 multiplier applies when there are no discards, plus the base total adds up to 38. It looks like I need 7500 overall, and I might achieve that with three hands.\n**Planning next moves**\n\nAfter the first hand, the Green Joker will raise the multiplier to 39, and I wonder if we can achieve another flush for maybe 3k+. However, I’m exploring the possibility of making a straight flush, but my five clubs (A, K, 8, 6, 3) aren't consecutive. Playing a flush seems better, or I could aim for a pair of 6s, 3s, or 8s. \n\nI should discard the 8♥ first to reach zero remaining discards for the Summit, and I’m considering whether to get rid of the 6♦ or 3♦ to draw a club for the flush.\n**Deciding on the discard**\n\nI’m considering that drawing a new card could improve my hand, but it isn't necessary. I need to choose a card to discard that won't be useful in the long run. The 8♥ might not help much, especially for a pair. I’d rather keep the 6♦ and 3♦ for the chance at a straight with 3-6 if I draw a 4 or 5. So, discarding the 8♥ seems like the best option. Alright, I'll go ahead and execute that action!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1]"}
