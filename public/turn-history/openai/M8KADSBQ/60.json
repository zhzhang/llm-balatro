{"reasoning":"**Choosing a tarot card**\n\nI’m in the TAROT_PACK after buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack and need to select one tarot card. My options are the Devil, Strength, Death, Wheel of Fortune, and Judgement. Judgement isn’t usable since I have max jokers already, which is a bummer. The Wheel of Fortune only has a 1 in 4 chance to add an edition to a random joker, but it could make a strong upgrade. The Devil is tempting for its economy benefits, while Strength might help with straights. I need to weigh these choices!\n**Choosing the best tarot card**\n\nThe Death card lets me copy another card, which can help create duplicates or suited cards for flushes. I have the Sun to convert into hearts for a heart flush, but the Gluttonous Joker pushes for clubs. My build includes Four Fingers, Green Joker, Mystic Summit, To the Moon, and Gluttonous Joker. Since Judgement isn’t an option, maybe I should go with the Wheel for its potential long-term benefits. The Wheel edition effects could enhance my jokers, making it a tempting choice!\n**Evaluating card editions and strategies**\n\nEditions may influence scoring, so for To the Moon, the Polychrome edition gives a x1.5 multiplier independently, which sounds huge! The Holographic gives a +10 multiplier, while the Foil adds +50 chips. That's a fantastic boost, especially for an economy joker, but it's only a 1 in 4 chance to succeed. The Devil card might secure consistent value by turning high cards into Gold for $3 if held. However, focusing on scoring improvements might be more crucial since we're already anteing with To the Moon. Plus, Death could help duplicate strong cards or create suits!\n**Analyzing card options**\n\nI need to look at my current hand: J♠, K♥, 3♥, 10♣, 7♣, A♦, and 10♦. The Death card allows me to select two cards and create duplicates, like turning J♠ into K♥ for a pair. However, this change modifies the deck permanently, which could help me form pairs or full houses. But for a straight flush with Four Fingers, I want suited sequences, so duplicates might not help as much. I think Death could be great for fixing my deck since it copies both rank and suit!\n**Weighing card choices**\n\nThe Strength card increases the rank of up to 2 selected cards, but it seems less impactful compared to other options. The Devil card offers a gold card that can be held for $3 at the end of the round, but I’d have to keep it unplayed—this might be tricky! However, Wheel feels like the best choice with its potential for huge scoring, especially with polychrome or holographic editions. Since I already have a solid economy with 30 money and To the Moon, I think I'll go with Wheel and select 4 cards!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
