{"reasoning":"**Clarifying mult mechanics**\n\nI'm working through how getting a total of 126 implies a multiplier of 3. I confirm that 42 times 3 equals 126, so the multiplier of 3 seems right. I think the green card adds 1 to this during the base multiplication. Wait, does the Green Joker trigger independently after scoring? It looks like it adds to the multiplier during scoring, incrementing after each hand played. So, it gains +1 when you play a hand but loses 1 per discard. That’s great!\n**Calculating flush strategy**\n\nSo, the multiplier becomes 4 plus the green card's +1, giving me a total of 5. That means a total of 60 times 5 equals 300, which is huge! After that, I need 174 chips with two hands, which seems doable if I get another flush or straight. I think we should aim for a diamond flush using four diamonds. If I include the 9 of clubs, can that still count as a flush? Yes, four diamonds suffice for a flush, as Four Fingers allows it. The kicker doesn’t count toward the flush.\n**Determining card strategy**\n\nIt seems like keeping the 9 of clubs for a potential future pair is a smart move since it won't help with the flush. So, I'll just play the four diamonds to conserve my hand. If I play those four cards, I'll draw four new cards, which keeps my hand at about seven cards. The current hand has 7 cards, and after playing 4, the remaining three (Queen, 9, 2 of clubs) stay. I'll aim for a flush and will specify the action in the response JSON format to reflect that.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7]"}
