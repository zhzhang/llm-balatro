{"reasoning":"**Considering shop options**\n\nI need to make a decision in the shop. I have $4, enough to buy the Green Joker, but I already have Four Fingers and Merry Andy. The Green Joker may conflict because Merry Andy encourages discarding, while the Joker penalizes it. Maybe I'd be better off saving my money for a telescope, which costs $10. If I can save and earn after beating the boss, keeping $4 for interest feels like the right move. I can't reroll, so I think I’ll go with round_select.\n**Analyzing Green Joker**\n\nI’m considering the Green Joker again. It might be beneficial if I can avoid discarding, but since Merry Andy lets me discard more, it complicates things. The Joker decreases my multiplier with each discard, while Andy offers extra discards without needing to use them all. The Joker could help if I play more hands, gaining +1 for each. But if the boss needs more chips, playing extra low hands might not be effective. Balancing saving for a telescope and keeping my cash feels tricky but important.\n**Evaluating expected value**\n\nI’m weighing the expected value of the Green Joker for the boss blind. With Four Fingers, I can make straights or flushes more easily, potentially adding a multiplier of +3 to +4. I could avoid the discard penalty by not using any discards, but Merry Andy reduces my hand size, which complicates things. Even if I use a couple of discards and accept a -2 multiplier, I could still gain some benefit overall. I have $4, so buying the Green Joker won’t prevent other purchases, but it might delay getting the telescope. Ultimately, I think it’s worth buying the Green Joker to aid in scoring.\n**Moving forward with the Green Joker**\n\nI’m realizing that the Green Joker operates independently, adding a multiplier for each hand played, reduced by discards. That sounds pretty advantageous! Now, I’m ready to take my next action: I’ll go ahead and buy the Green Joker card. It seems like a smart move to enhance my gameplay.
