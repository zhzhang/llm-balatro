{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker purchase options**\n\nI need to decide whether to purchase jokers or reroll. I have five full jokers, and the shop has Zany Joker and Business Card at $3 each because of a clearance sale. To buy one, I must sell a current joker. Looking at my build, Zany Joker offers some potential for multipliers, but my current strategy focuses more on straights and flushes, not threes of a kind. The Business Card seems like a solid way to boost my economy without compromising my current approach.\n**Assessing joker value and strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how to keep my money high while needing scaling chips or multipliers for future antes. My deck is probably standard, with clubs and potential for flushes, which works well with Gluttonous for multipliers. However, I also have the Sun to convert to hearts, but that doesn't sync well with my current strategy. It might be time to consider replacing the Green Joker since it only gives +1 right now. For my upcoming rounds, it may make sense to prioritize other options over the Green Joker until it scales better.\n**Weighing joker options and strategies**\n\nI'm considering whether the Business Card might be better than the Green Joker since we already have a good multiplier. It seems we need scoring rather than just economy at this point, especially with To the Moon boosting our interest. Maybe I should reroll for a better scoring joker like Shortcut or Super. However, that reroll costs 6, and with only 15 left, I want to stay above 25 for maximum interest. Selling the Green Joker for the Zany Joker could enhance my strategy, too.\n**Evaluating joker and cards strategy**\n\nI'm assessing the value of the Zany Joker with its +12 multiplier for three of a kind versus the Green Joker, which is currently only at +1 but could grow over time. However, building three of a kind isn't typical for my hand levels right now. The Business Card might not be worth buying, as Mystic Summit gives a solid +15 multiplier. I’m leaning toward keeping my Gluttonous card, which consistently supports my club flush strategy. Given all this, rerolling may be unnecessary, so I might just exit and save my money for interest instead.\n**Deciding on rerolls and joker order**\n\nI can afford one more reroll to find a strong joker, but the increasing cost makes me think twice. Right now, if I keep my 15 money, my interest yields 3+3. Although spending 6 to reroll would drop my interest to 2, which isn't ideal. Selling the Green Joker for the Business Card could boost my economy, but I'd prefer to keep the Green Joker for scoring. Ultimately, it seems best to proceed to the next blind while maintaining my money. Rearranging my jokers might not matter much for scoring since their independent effects play a role.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
