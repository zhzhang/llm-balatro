{"reasoning":"**Considering card mechanics**\n\nFour Fingers lets players create 4-card straights or flushes, which is handy for forming strong hands. I think we can probably clear ante3 without spending more. The Lovers consumable can be useful later; it turns a selected key card into a wild card, but I wonder if it’s best to use it in a round after seeing the deck. Wait, the Lovers actually enhances a card in hand, so we need to hold onto it until we can use it properly.\n**Evaluating shopping decisions**\n\nI think the best action might be to stop shopping to keep $5 for interest. However, I could consider buying Venus since I can use it right away; it doesn’t require a target. But using Venus costs $3 and would take up a consumable slot. I wonder if I want to sacrifice that interest for the chance to level up? My current build seems to focus on flushes and straights, which makes me think another planet would help more. Maybe I should skip and reroll for a better joker instead.\n**Selecting round actions**\n\nGiven the strong run and the economy with Joker, it seems best to preserve my money. I can carry $5 into the next round to earn interest, especially since I anticipate a small blind increase after ante3. I'll need to choose round_select. However, I notice we're at Ante 3/8, and it looks like we are in Round 5. The round number might refer to a global state, but that's not really crucial right now. I’ll focus on selecting the blind after the shop and return the JSON with the round_select action.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
