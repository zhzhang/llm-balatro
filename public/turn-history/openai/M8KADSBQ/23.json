{"reasoning":"**Evaluating celestial pack value**\n\nI'm considering whether buying the celestial pack by selling jokers is worth it. Since leveling up a flush from 35 chips might depend on planets—like Jupiter for flush and Saturn for straight—taking Jupiter could strengthen our flush. However, selling a joker feels risky, as I’d have to sell Merry Andy to get the money. Selling that joker would net me around $4, but I'd be left with nothing. It’s tough to decide; I’d rather keep my jokers.\n**Considering sell or keep decisions**\n\nI’m weighing the decision to sell Merry Andy to buy the celestial pack. Although it has downsides like hand size reduction, that could be beneficial since it allows for helpful discards. If we aim for flushes with four fingers, we might not need those extra discards. Selling Merry Andy would give us $3, letting us upgrade Flush or Straight right away. This could improve scoring and base chips permanently, which seems worthwhile despite losing some jokers. But is it the right choice?\n**Deciding actions for upgrades**\n\nI’m considering entering ante2 with low funds and no upgrades. Investing in strength, like a flush, seems preferable, but I don’t know which planets to choose from. Even a random planet might help, like Jupiter or Saturn. Buying the celestial pack should yield at least one useful upgrade. I’ll sell Merry Andy to have $4 and then can buy the booster. So, my immediate action will be to sell the joker, specifically Merry Andy, which is step one for my strategy.\n**Evaluating selling options**\n\nI'm thinking it might be better to sell the green joker, but it scales well and has no downside. To the Moon seems like a solid investment I’d like to keep. I consider Four Fingers to be essential, so my best move is to sell Merry Andy instead. I’ll proceed with that decision and return the action as JSON to reflect the sale: sell_joker positions [2]. This feels like the right choice for my strategy!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
