{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shopping strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about a shop with a free jumbo standard pack and a $10 clearance sale voucher giving 25% off. Since I have $30, I'll probably grab the free pack first. That voucher could really come in handy for future purchases, but I'm aware it costs $10. \n\nHmm, buying the voucher now makes sense, even if I can’t use it on the free pack. My next action should definitely be buying the booster.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
