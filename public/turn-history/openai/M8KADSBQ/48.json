{"reasoning":"**Deciding on blind strategy**\n\nI need to choose between playing or skipping the small blind. Skipping offers a nice immediate value of $14 but at the cost of the $3 reward and missing out on a shop. If I skip the small blind, I'd move to the big blind selection and can decide whether to play or skip for a coupon. I want to optimize my strategy for the upcoming boss fight, where I'll need a solid hand with 2000 chips. Our current build seems well-balanced.\n**Evaluating discard strategy**\n\nI want to minimize discards, but I think discards usually start at 2 or 3, with the standard being 2. If I use both discards, it drops the Green Joker's bonus from +4 to +2 but activates the Mystic Summit for a +15 bonus. So, the net gain is +13. If I started with 3 discards, it would downgrade the Green Joker to +1, giving a net of +12. The strategy seems worth it, especially with To the Moon providing additional interest.\n**Analyzing tag benefits**\n\nThe Handy Tag provides $1 for each hand played during this run, which means after 14 hands, it could grant me $14 if I skip the small blind. That’s a significant immediate cash boost! I believe the tag's effects take place right when I acquire it, so I should definitely skip the small blind to maximize my gain. If I play it right, I could increase my money to $19 and possibly buy Hieroglyph in the next shop!\n**Considering skip consequences**\n\nIf I skip the small blind, it means I won't have a shop opportunity until I beat a blind. Skipping leads straight to the big blind selection, and if I win there, I can shop before facing the boss. Usually, I can shop after each beaten blind, but skipping changes that. I could also consider skipping the big blind for the Coupon Tag, which offers free items in the next shop. However, skipping the big blind would send me directly to the boss without shopping. What a tricky situation!\n**Evaluating skip strategy**\n\nIf I skip the big blind, I’ll get the coupon tag and face the boss right after. While that sounds good because it leads to a shop with free items after winning, I’d miss out on the $4 reward for playing. Still, I can reach 2000 with one hand, thanks to the high multiplier. I’ll also have the Lovers item, which I can use during the round to improve my hand. \n\nFor the small blind, if I play, I earn $3 and gain access to a shop afterward. Skipping gives $14, which is tempting, but I won't get to shop until I win a blind. My best option looks like skipping the small blind for money, then playing the big blind to shop before the boss. So, I should respond with an action to skip the round.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
