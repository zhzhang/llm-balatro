{"reasoning":"**Evaluating Ectoplasm effects**\n\nEctoplasm adds a negative value to a random Joker, reduces hand size and increases the joker slot by one. This means I could go from a hand size of 8 to 7 but gain an extra joker slot, which might be valuable later. Since I'm in ante 5, losing hand size might hurt my chances for a straight flush. However, with Four Fingers, the requirement for a straight or flush decreases, making hand size less critical. I lean towards using Ectoplasm.\n**Considering Ectoplasm and card effects**\n\nEctoplasm brings in an extra joker slot, but there's a chance it might hit Showman, who could already be negative. If that's the case, does it waste the negative effect? I'm uncertain if it can select a different non-negative joker. With six jokers, my chance of hitting a waste is only 1/6. However, the permanent -1 hand size is a concern. Deja Vu with a red seal could enhance a high-value card like the Ace of Diamonds or Ace of Clubs, retriggering extra chips and possible scoring bonuses.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nIt looks like the retrigger effect means I could earn $6 per play if my card scores, which is really strong for economy. Deja Vu seems best on the Ace of Diamonds for this reason, but I need to ensure that the card scores in my hand. I usually play for straight flushes, so including the ace might be tricky. I could also aim to make pairs. There's a risk with Grim potentially destroying my important cards. I think I'll go with Deja Vu targeting Ace of Diamonds in position 5 while I still have my consumable Devil in the spectral pack.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,5]"}
