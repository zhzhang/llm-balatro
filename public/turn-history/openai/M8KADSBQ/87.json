{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop decision**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy this Strength card that boosts the ranks of two cards by 1. It's a minor boost, but it could help with straights or straight flushes. It’s only $2, which isn’t a huge hit to my funds. However, I’m also balancing my interest earnings with the To the Moon account, which offers extra interest based on how much I hold. Spending now could lower my potential earnings, but Strength might just improve my score enough to make up for it.\n**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI'm considering our current scoring rate of 3,000 per hand, while it looks like the boss requirement for the ante might range between 20,000 and 24,000. With future ante levels, we’ll likely need stronger multipliers, which Strength doesn't provide. Maybe I should reroll for boosters or jokers, but that costs $6 and would leave me with little interest if I drop to $5. Still, I might find something valuable to improve our level. Overall, it feels like we've got enough to handle the boss for now, so maybe skipping Strength and focusing on the next round is the way to go.\n**Weighing the value of Strength**\n\nI'm trying to figure out if having Strength is advantageous. I could store it for later use, but it takes up a consumable slot. I might be able to sell it for $1, but I'm not certain. Since I'm currently at $11, keeping my funds above $10 would yield 4 interest each round. Buying Strength would drop my money to $9 and cut my interest in half, which doesn’t seem worth it. I’m also pondering whether to sell Showman, considering it’s at capacity but could impact my joker slots.\n**Clarifying Showman and joker slots**\n\nI'm sorting out how Showman interacts with joker slots. It seems to provide an additional slot on its own, plus there's the negative edition that might give me an extra joker slot. This could mean a total of 2 additional slots. In Balatro, Showman seems to uniquely add this joker slot as well. The max joker capacity stated is 6, which would include what Showman adds. It’s a bit complex, and I'm still trying to clarify how the negative edition fits into this.\n**Understanding Balatro jokers**\n\nIn Balatro, it seems that negative jokers don’t take up a slot and actually provide an extra joker slot. I need to confirm that negative editions allow me to exceed the joker limit by one. They also appear to give -1 hand size. Our system prompt isn't very clear on this, but it implies that negative adds a joker slot while still counting toward my max slots, which is now up to 6. Ultimately, I think it’s best to move on to the round select and preserve my money.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
