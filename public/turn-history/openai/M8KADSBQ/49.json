{"reasoning":"**Calculating game strategies**\n\nPlaying big blind lets me engage in multiple hands while raising my green joker by how many hands I play. However, discards mean I might lose some advantage. Being in the big blind also allows for a shopping opportunity after winning, which could be great for obtaining more jokers. On the other hand, skipping shopping means I immediately face the boss; my current strategy could still work. For example, I need to figure out my multipliers effectively to maximize my chips.\n**Strategizing for chip requirements**\n\nI'm calculating my chips, thinking maybe I'd start with around 35 plus additional card chips. However, even if I multiply 60 by 23 to get 1380, that might not be enough. I might get another 200-300 with card chips, but still, it's not ideal. To reach 2000 in one hand, I really should aim for either a straight flush or a full house for better multipliers. If I can discard efficiently and use my cards wisely, replicating my past success might be achievable.\n**Evaluating strategy with Lovers and big blind**\n\nI realize that using the Lovers card requires a target in hand and can't work in blind select. In a boss fight with just one hand, I can utilize Lovers to turn a card into a wild, boosting my straight flush chances. So, skipping the big blind might be smart. However, playing the big blind allows for a shop before facing the boss, which could help. Choosing to skip it gives me a coupon for a free shop after the boss. Although I might lose a $4 reward, I'll keep $19, which seems worth it in the end!\n**Weighing options for gameplay**\n\nIf I choose to play the big blind and earn $4, my ending money may increase, but spending in the shop could reduce it. Since my current deck isn't revealed, I'm thinking the safe path is to play the big blind, shop, and then face the boss. Still, using the coupon tag could be even better. To estimate if I can beat the boss, I need 2000 in one hand. If I only manage a 4-card flush, I’ll need to calculate my chip contributions and multipliers carefully. But, it seems I won't reach my goal.\n**Planning strategy for boss fight**\n\nI need to analyze my options for getting that straight flush, which requires about 130 chips and a solid multiplier. I could potentially use Lovers to make any card wild, which could simplify making a straight flush. By skipping the big blind, I could unlock a free shop—very tempting! However, I’d give up the $4 reward and some interest from playing. Still, with the potential to gather free items, skipping the big blind seems advantageous. I feel confident about my chance in the boss fight, aiming for that straight flush!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
