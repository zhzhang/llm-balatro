{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop strategy**\n\nI'm in a shop with $0, so buying is off the table. I could consider selling jokers for funds, but with my early Ante2 build looking strong with Four Fingers, I need to think carefully. The Green Joker helps based on hands played, but without money, it’s useless right now. Bootstraps cost 7, which means I'd need to sell multiple jokers. It seems better to keep my jokers and play the round to earn some money first. I should select blind now.\n**Finalizing round actions**\n\nI'm considering that \"To the Moon\" operates independently at the end of the round. Right now, the order of triggers may not matter too much, but if there are multiple in the same category, it would be left-to-right. The Green Joker triggers before scoring, and it looks like nothing else falls into that category. I need to determine if \"To the Moon\" is included in the independent stage, but it seems like it’s good to go. So, I’ll proceed with the action to select the round now.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
