{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the current game situation. We have a situation involving a blind select and some constraints. We need 800 chips, which seems manageable based on what I see. The idea of skipping shops might be tricky, as it seems to affect future turns. Playing small to earn $3 seems like a smart move to then visit a shop afterward. I believe we should proceed with a round to play and earn those chips!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
