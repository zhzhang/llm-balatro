{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nSince we're early in the game, I think buying Lovers could help set up wild cards to create flushes or straight flushes more reliably. Mystic Summit doesn’t require discards, so we'll depend on draws, which makes suit flexibility from a wild card valuable. With the remaining $5, I can reroll the shop for cards—not boosters—to potentially find jokers or useful cards. \n\nAlternatively, I could buy a Jumbo Spectral pack for $6. That might offer immediate benefits, but there could be trade-offs too.\n**Considering purchases wisely**\n\nGiven that I don't have much money, the early spectral can really influence my game. I should think about buying a spectral pack now instead of rerolling. With 8 coins, I could buy Lovers for 3 but not both Lovers and Jumbo Spectral for 6. \n\nThe Jumbo Spectral could have a high value, possibly including useful cards like Cryptid or even Ankh, which could duplicate a random joker! Duplicating Mystic Summit would be amazing for its multiplier. But some options, like Ectoplasm, could reduce hand size. It's a tough choice!\n**Focusing on immediate needs**\n\nI need to make a choice quickly, considering the possibility of negative effects, like with Ouija, which converts all cards to the same rank but reduces hand size. However, it could help me achieve a five of a kind. Since my current run is already scoring high, I should prioritize my economy and consistent growth. \n\nBuying Lovers seems like a safe and inexpensive option, allowing me to keep $5 for interest. A reroll costs $5, which would wipe out my savings and impact my interest, so it’s better to preserve that money and aim for growth.\n**Analyzing interest strategy**\n\nWith \"To the Moon,\" it looks like each $5 gives me an extra $2 in interest since it’s $1 from base interest and another $1 due to the bonus. This means keeping my money above multiples of $5 is quite beneficial! \n\nRight now, I have $8, and I should aim to have at least $10 to maximize interest. Spending $3 drops me to $5, which still gives me $2 interest. Buying the spectral for $6 would reduce my interest, so purchasing Lovers is the smarter choice since it keeps my total at $5. I'll go ahead and buy Lovers!\n**Finalizing the action**\n\nSince the task requires a single action right now, I'll go ahead and choose to buy card 1. I should check the consumable capacity, and it seems I have 2 empty slots, so that works for me! Now, I'll prepare to return a JSON response with the action to buy the card at position 1. This should keep things moving smoothly!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
