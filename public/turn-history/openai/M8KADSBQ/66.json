{"reasoning":"**Calculating jokers and multipliers**\n\nI'm assessing our jokers, noting that besides Mystic Summit's +15 bonus when there are no discards, we could gain additional multipliers. If we achieve a straight flush with clubs, there's potentially a +12 multiplier from being gluttonous. So, considering a 4-card straight flush: the type is straight flush, and the total scored cards would be the four clubs. Each club contributes +3 multipliers; Mystic Summit also adds a +15 bonus under certain conditions. I think everything's independent, but I need to ensure that’s accurate.\n**Calculating total multipliers**\n\nOkay, my total multiplier would combine a base of 8 with +12 from gluttonous triggering during scoring. After scoring, I add a +1 from green and +15 from Mystic, leading to a total multiplier of about 36. For chips, starting at 100 and adding around 40 from 4 cards gives me 140. Multiplying that by 36 results in 5040, which is sufficient for a small blind with a straight flush in clubs. However, a 5-card straight flush might be stronger, so I'd need to crunch those numbers further.\n**Planning for the boss round**\n\nI’m considering that for the boss round at 10,000, I might need to play 2 hands, but I have 4 hands available. Normally, I can play up to 4 hands with potential discards. Mystic Summit's ability to reduce discards to zero is a benefit. A strategy could be to play small blind first to access the shop afterward, but skipping to play big might offer a stronger advantage. If I win the big round, I’ll get access to the shop again for buying jokers. It seems tricky but worth managing!\n**Considering skipping small blind**\n\nI’m weighing the options of skipping the small blind. It would mean missing out on the $3 reward and any end-of-round interest, which feels risky. However, skipping allows me to bypass the round and start fresh with all my resources for the big blind. Right now, I have $15 and a To the Moon card, which offers interest. \n\nIf I play both small and big, I could access two shops and gain more funds. But the negative tag's benefits may outweigh the $3 reward, as it provides a shop joker for free, which is a significant value!\n**Evaluating the skip tag on big blind**\n\nI’m thinking about the skip tag on the big blind that offers $20, which is quite valuable. However, skipping big means I might face the boss without access to shops from small or big blind, and that could be problematic. While $20 could help after the boss, if I can’t beat the boss, that investment becomes useless. \n\nThe best move might be to skip the small blind for a negative tag, and then play big to gain access to the shop and buy a free negative joker. This strategy should boost my chances against the boss. I'll proceed with the command to skip the small blind!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
