{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategy**\n\nIf I rely on discards to find hands, I might lose scaling. Mystic Summit wants zero discards remaining, so should I spend discards to reach that? But doing so reduces my Green multiplier, and with two greens, the penalty for discarding doubles, which isn’t good. I should keep Crafty instead of going for a second green. Another idea could be to buy green and sell To the Moon, but I'd rather reroll the shop to look for better options. The reroll costs $5, and with $9 available, I hope to find cheap jokers through discounts.\n**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nWith $9, I can either afford one reroll or make some purchases. I need to decide whether to reroll now or go to round select. Rerolling could potentially give me better items, but we’re in ante 5, round 8, which may be after beating a boss. It’s a bit tricky to determine if round 8 is part of ante 4 or ante 5. But it looks like we just started ante 5. Each blind counts as a round, so I need to be prepared for Blind Select next.\n**Planning shop strategy**\n\nIt looks like we need to beat three blinds of ante 5, and scoring upgrades are important. We have a consumable called The Devil, which can enhance a selected card into a Gold Card for extra cash at the end of the round. But I can’t use it now because I need a target card in hand, and the shop phase doesn’t show my hand. I can’t apply it randomly either, so the best next move seems to be to reroll the shop for better jokers or tarot cards. I have only a Green Joker right now. Also, I should consider saving money for interest since To the Moon can double it!\n**Calculating interest and reroll strategy**\n\nWith $9, we earn $1 in base interest plus an extra $1 per $5 from To the Moon, which totals $2 per $5. This means at $9, I can expect to get $2. However, if I spend $5 to reroll, I’ll only have $4 left, which means no interest. That could hurt. But the discounts in the shop could make rerolling worthwhile. I want to keep at least $5 by the end of the next round, even if I reroll now. I might be fine considering the potential gains.\n**Considering card options**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to buy the Green Joker and sell my current Green card. But can I really replace my current +2 with a new +0? That doesn’t seem right. Holding onto what I have isn't an option either. Rerolling might be better, especially to find a strong tarot card like The Sun. Plus, since Showman allows duplicates and vouchers help reduce costs, the reroll could yield booster packs, but it only affects the cards section. I’ll go ahead and spend $5 to reroll the shop!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
