{"reasoning":"**Planning game strategy**\n\nI'm in shop ante2 round 2 with $4 and need a plan. I've already sold Merry Andy to buy the Celestial pack, which lets me level key hand. Four Fingers supports Flush and Straight, so my planet options are likely Jupiter (for flush) or Saturn (for straight). However, I can't see the options yet; I need to buy a booster to access them, leaving me with no money afterward. So, it seems best to go ahead and buy the Celestial pack. I'll proceed with that!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
