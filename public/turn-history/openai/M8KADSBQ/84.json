{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop, but there aren't any items available. My options are to reroll or leave. With $18, rerolling costs $5, which reduces interest but might improve scoring. Currently, I have some keys and characters like Four Fingers and Mystic Summit. There's this Showman character, but it seems like the negative edition adds an extra slot for jokers. However, I already have the maximum of 6 filled joker slots, so I'm at max capacity.\n**Analyzing reroll decision**\n\nIt seems like I shouldn't reroll right now because the shop is empty, possibly due to a bug. Normally, you'd get new cards after buying the last one. Rerolling could help find something useful like xMult or tarot/planet, but spending $5 may cut into my interest, especially since I'm earning quite a bit from To the Moon. Calculating, it looks like I’d make $6 interest with $18, but if I reroll and end up with $13, I'd only generate $4 interest. The effective cost of rerolling seems quite high.\n**Strategizing before boss blind**\n\nI've just finished the Big Blind of Ante 4, and now I'm looking at the shop before facing the boss. I need to beat the boss to progress to Ante 5. It's probably wise to save my money for interest and potential vouchers. However, since I have Showman, I might get duplicates or find a better joker. Rerolling costs $5, and I'd like to keep at least $15 for interest. If I reroll once, I’d drop to $13 and lose $2 in interest. Should I hold off on that and focus on optimizing my jokers?\n**Evaluating jokers and shop options**\n\nRight now, Scholar is my only on-scored joker. I'm considering how other jokers trigger, like Green and Mystic Summit. Their effects are independent, but I think order matters a bit, especially with Scholar, which should probably come last. It seems that only Scholar triggers for on-scored jokers in the left-to-right order. Since the shop is empty, this might be a good time to reroll, especially with a 25% clearance sale to get new items. I need to balance that with keeping my money.\n**Deciding on rerolling strategy**\n\nI think it makes sense to invest now before facing the boss since the shop is empty after my last purchase. Rerolling could help me find booster packs or jokers, and I can do that while maintaining some money for interest. With upcoming ante thresholds rising, acquiring an xMult joker or planet cards like 'Neptune' could be crucial for leveling my Straight Flush. My strategy would be to reroll once and if I find something good, buy it. If not, I can leave. So, my next action is likely going to be to reroll at the shop!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
