{"reasoning":"**Considering shop dynamics in Balatro**\n\nIf I choose to play big, after winning, I get to shop, which is a core part of Balatro. Each blind played leads to a shopping opportunity. Skipping a blind means missing out on the shop, and if I skip small blinds, I jump straight to big blinds without a shop stop. Even though skipping small might seem tempting for the tag, losing a shop could be detrimental, especially with ante5 needing as many shops as possible. The additional vouchers help reduce costs, but the tag offers a free mega arcana pack, which might ultimately be better.\n**Evaluating charm tag strategy**\n\nI think the charm tag gives a free Mega Arcana Pack at the next shop, but it seems that its effect triggers immediately upon entering the shop. If I skip the small blind, I receive the tag, then go directly to big blind selection. If I play big and win, I'll get the free pack when I finally shop, but I do lose one shop opportunity by skipping. So, it’s a comparison: play small for immediate rewards or skip for a delayed but potentially better gain.\n**Comparing small vs. big plays**\n\nIf I play small, I get to shop, then go to big, another shop, boss, and shop again. But if I skip small, I only shop after big and boss, which could impact my economy and scaling. With my current $2, playing small gives a $3 reward, plus potential leftover hands and interest. If I win with leftover hands, I could reach around $9. Skipping small starts me at $2 with no interest and a $4 big blind reward, which could still lead to $8, but I'd be missing out on the small reward and interest.\n**Strategizing with charm tag and jokers**\n\nThe charm tag’s mega arcana can be powerful, but there's no guarantee, and with voucher discounts, shop tarot are already cheap. I think it makes sense to play the small blind to earn money and shop items. Since I have scaling options with stencil and Mystic Summit, I should be able to win. I need to consider the order of jokers during the blind selection. I’ll place them with Mystic Summit next to the stencil for the best multiplier effect since it boosts scores effectively. Overall, my current order should work well!\n**Finalizing round play strategy**\n\nI realize that independent triggers activate left-to-right, so having additive effects, like Mystic triggering before Stencil, is beneficial. I can proceed with playing the round. In the command spec, I need to indicate the intended hand type, likely a straight flush, along with estimated chips. While I can play four cards for a straight flush, I must keep in mind that the boss requires five cards later. However, since Four Fingers lets me select four cards, I should be fine. I’ll estimate chips around 9k per good hand and prepare the JSON output.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
