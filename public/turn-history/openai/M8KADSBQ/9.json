{"reasoning":"**Calculating optimal chips**\n\nI need to reach 450 chips and I'm currently at 431, so I need 19 more. With my current hand (8S, 5S, 4H, Qc, 9c, Qd, 10d, 8d), my best scoring play is to use the pair of queens. That gives me a base of 10 chips, multiplying to 30 when considering each queen's value. \n\nAlternatively, I can also do two pairs with Qc, Qd, 8S, and 8D, which adds up to even more chips—about 112. Let’s clarify the hand type!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,6,8]"}
