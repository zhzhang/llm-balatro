{"reasoning":"**Calculating flush strategy**\n\nI'm considering aiming for a flush with 4 cards, possibly involving a multiplier card, but I don't have one available right now. The goal is to reach a total of 10k, and I'm already at 4750 with three hands. If I can secure another straight flush worth around 4k and a little extra, I could win. Using Mystic for an extra multiplier could elevate the flush point from 4750 to maybe 8000, so it’s worth calculating!\n**Finalizing multiplier strategy**\n\nSo it seems my final multiplier reached 19, which comes from a base of 12 plus a multiplier card worth 4, and a green bonus of 3. The formula checks out, giving me a total of 250 chips contributing to my score of 4750. To surpass 5250 in one hand, I need to either ramp up my multiplier or chips. With Mystic active for additional +15, I could potentially aim for another straight flush to secure victory in one hand, provided I manage my discards wisely!\n**Planning straight flush options**\n\nI have three hands with no discards, which is fine since I’ll gain a +15 multiplier for each play. Not discarding means I can’t adjust later, but I can choose effectively to target a straight flush. I need four hearts to make that work, and I have some possible sequences from my existing heart ranks. For instance, I could aim for Q-J-10-9 with just a J♥ needed, or 10-9-8-7 with an 8♥ required. So, there are specific cards I need to watch out for!\n**Maximizing card draws**\n\nThe simplest option would be drawing either the 8♥ or J♥. I have two discards available, allowing me to keep essential cards like 10♥, 9♥, and 7♥ while discarding others to draw the needed hearts. However, discarding reduces my green points. I currently hold 8 cards and can discard up to 5, so I want to maximize my chances of drawing the missing card. My best approach would be to retain key hearts for a possible flush, but I should focus on aiming for that straight flush instead!\n**Strategizing discards for draws**\n\nI’m analyzing the probability of drawing specific cards like 8♥ or J♥. With 32 cards left in the deck, there might still be an 8♥ or a J♥ available; both cards are possible. Since I have two discards, I can strategically keep key hearts like Q♥, 10♥, 9♥, and 7♥ while discarding non-essential cards like 2♠, 6♦, and maybe A♥ or 3♥ to maximize my chance of drawing what I need. The goal is to create a straight flush, so I’ll be careful with my choices and plan my discards accordingly!\n**Planning discard strategy**\n\nI’m considering how many cards to discard for the best chance of achieving a straight flush. I think I shouldn’t discard all four cards; maybe I’ll discard five instead while keeping three key cards. Keeping 10♥, 9♥, 7♥, and possibly Q♥ sounds smart. After my first discard, if I draw either J♥ or 8♥, I’ll be set. Still, I have to be mindful of activating Mystic, which requires me to have no discards left. I'm weighing all options to make the most of my draws!\n**Deciding on discard strategy**\n\nI’m weighing how many cards to discard to optimize my chances. Using both discards could let me play flushes worth around 3100, but I need at least 5250. I can aim for flushes in hearts, and since I have 10♥, 9♥, 7♥, and Q♥, I think it’s best to discard 2♠, 6♦, 3♥, and possibly 7♥. Keeping my high hearts is essential for maximizing score potential, especially if I draw more hearts or useful multipliers!\n**Evaluating discard choices**\n\nI'm calculating the best way to discard cards. Keeping 7♥ is crucial for pursuing a straight flush. I plan to discard 2♠, A♥, 3♥, and 6♦, which leaves me with Q♥, 10♥, 9♥, and 7♥, plus four new cards. I still have one discard left. If I draw 8♥ or J♥, I can discard the others and activate Mystic for bonus multipliers. My next action will be to discard those specific cards to optimize my chances!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
