{"reasoning":"**Considering inventory usage**\n\nI need to decide on my next action in the shop. I've got the Hermit consumable that I can use to potentially double my money, up to a max of $20. This means if I have $37, using the Hermit would add $20, bringing my total to $57. That looks good since there are no downsides besides using a slot for it. I’m thinking about using it now and then possibly buying the Emperor later. However, I need to keep in mind that the interest cap of $50 means I won't earn beyond that threshold.\n**Deciding on consumable use**\n\nI realize that having more than $50 doesn't increase my interest, but having extra money is helpful for future shops. Since there’s no reason not to take a free boost of +20, I should go ahead and use the Hermit consumable. It’s an easy choice and gives me a nice increase without any targets or downsides involved. Time to use consumable 1! This will set me up better for what's next.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
