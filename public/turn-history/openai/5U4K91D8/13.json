{"reasoning":"**Planning for the game**\n\nI'm in a shop after the big blind with $8. Currently, we only have the Blue Joker. The next blind is against a boss who debuffs Spades, so I need a strategy. The shop has a Fortune Teller for $6, which can help, but I haven't used any tarot cards yet. The Jumbo Celestial pack for $6 offers planet choices, which could be helpful. I need to focus on using non-Spade scoring cards to adjust my strategy effectively.\n**Calculating strategy with the Blue Joker**\n\nThe Blue Joker increases my chip count significantly based on the deck size and isn't impacted by the Spade debuff. I can potentially beat the boss by forming two pairs or a full house with mainly non-Spade cards. The Blue Joker adds a hefty +104 chips with a full 52-card deck. It looks like the deck replenished after the last round, which is great. I’m aiming for a full house or a flush or straight, maximizing my multipliers to reach the needed number of chips to win.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nSince Spades are debuffed, I need to ensure my full house cards aren't Spades, which could be tricky but doable with strategic discards. Currently, the Fortune Teller doesn’t offer enough value with a +0 multiplier for its cost. Instead, the Jumbo Celestial pack for $6 seems like a better investment because it allows me to choose a planet to level up my hand. With $8, I can buy the Jumbo pack and still have $2 left. So, I’ll buy the Jumbo Celestial pack to prepare for the boss battle and see what planet I get!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
