{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI see we have solid multipliers, but there's room to enhance hand levels. It seems leveling with a straight might be advantageous, and buying Saturn now could be a good move since it's cheap. The Arcana pack might offer tarot cards that could help create steel cards for \"Shoot the Moon,\" but I'd need specific cards like \"The Chariot.\" Without the Merchant, obtaining these would be less frequent, and I'll need to maximize my consumable slots carefully. I’m prioritizing long-term deck enhancement instead.\n**Assessing deck enhancement strategy**\n\nI’m considering the impact of having the Merchant at ante4, which can boost my chances of finding tarots to improve my deck for ante6-8. Since it’s only $10 and I have 14, it makes sense to buy the Tarot Merchant and then spend the remaining 4 on an Arcana pack. That way, I get immediate tarot access and future enhancements. While Saturn can wait, enhancing the deck and improving jokers seems more significant to me, but I need to weigh the impacts of removing cards on the Blue Joker’s value.\n**Exploring deck enhancement options**\n\nI’m thinking I could maintain my deck size while adding enhancements through tarots without needing to remove cards. The Tarot Merchant is tempting for buying tarots, but that costs money too. It might be smarter to buy Saturn, an Arcana pack, and a Buffoon pack, totaling 11, which leaves me with 3 left. While the Buffoon might offer a less useful joker, the Arcana pack guarantees some valuable tarots. A reroll could help me find a better joker or voucher, but it costs 5, leaving me with 7 afterward. What’s my weakness here? Chips scaling? Playing two pairs could multiply my rewards significantly.\n**Assessing hand strategies**\n\nMy current hand level for Two Pair is decent at 4, while a Straight is just 1. Leveling could offer alternatives, and buying Saturn might encourage playing straights, especially since it synergizes with Even Steven but doesn’t demand face cards. If I focus on straights due to ante4, they could be trickier than sticking with Two Pair. To maximize Card Sharp, I need to repeat the same hand type, which is easier with pairs than two pairs. I might consider upgrading my pair with planets like Mercury, but it’s not available in the shop right now.\n**Planning the next action**\n\nI’m considering that while pairs have a low base, with multipliers and jokers, they might still be effective. I could also try playing high cards first, which works well with \"Shoot the Moon.\" To boost scaling, I could get a Buffoon pack to find better scaling jokers like the Green Joker or Spare Trousers. It seems like getting a voucher and an Arcana pack together is a strong move. I think my best next action is to buy a voucher, so I’ll go with that command: {\"action\":\"buy_voucher\",\"positions\":[1]}.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
