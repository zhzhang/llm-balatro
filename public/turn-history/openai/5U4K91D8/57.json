{"reasoning":"**Planning next action**\n\nI'm considering my next move in the game. Right now, I have an Ace of Spades, but there are four face-down cards. I scored 2622 on the first hand, needing 4000 total, which means I only need 1378 more with three hands left. Since the Card Sharp feature is now active, it seems like I should play a Pair again to maximize my potential. I need to decide whether to try using unknown face cards or focus on known pairs for better chances.\n**Evaluating hand strategy**\n\nI have three hands left, and I'm thinking about playing a minimal pair. I could select two unknowns to see if they form a pair, but if they don't, I might still score with a high card—which might not be enough since I need 1378 points. Because of Card Sharp, I need to repeat a pair. I could also discard known cards to draw, but I should consider holding onto unknowns in case I can get a Shoot the Moon with queens.\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI can't really know the ranks of my unknown cards, but if I play a small pair with non-face cards, like 2s, I might score multipliers if I hold on to some unknown face cards. Right now, I only have one each of A, 2, 10, and 8, which doesn't make a pair. I think I should discard some cards to try and draw a pair. I might discard 8♦, 10♦, 2♣, and A♠ while keeping the unknown face cards for potential queens. Discarding four cards uses only one of my available discards, so it seems like a solid plan.\n**Assessing hand options**\n\nI need to be careful here. If I keep four face-down cards and draw four new non-face cards, I might still not get a pair, but I can use my remaining discards and hands later. Alternatively, I could play a hand now with the known cards 8♦, 10♦, 2♣, A♠, and one unknown. This would likely score as a high card with A being the highest. That would give me 16 chips plus a potential multiplier if I play the Ace of Spades. However, since this is a different hand, I wouldn't get the Card Sharp multiplier.\n**Calculating potential points**\n\nSo, the base multiplier for a high card starts at 1, and it gets an additional 3 for having the Ace of Spades. This means my total multiplier could reach 4. However, I need to remember that \"Even Steven\" doesn’t apply and that I can boost my score if I have queens for \"Shoot the Moon.\" My strategy is to discard the visible non-face cards in positions 1, 5, 7, and 8 while ensuring I stick to the correct discard command format. After discarding, I'll draw four replacement cards and keep the unknown face downs. Let's proceed with that!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,5,7,8]"}
