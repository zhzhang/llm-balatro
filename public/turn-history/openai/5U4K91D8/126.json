{"reasoning":"**Deciding on card actions**\n\nI need to figure out my next move based on my hand. My boss has debuffed the diamonds, and I have three hands with five discards. Currently, I have 2,282 chips and need 40,000, so I still need 37,718 more. I have jokers with a \"Shoot the Moon\" ability that depends on Queens held in hand. My only Queen is debuffed, which usually disables abilities, but I'm wondering if it still counts as a Queen for this ability. I think it likely does.\n**Formulating my card strategy**\n\nHolding the Qd unplayed gives me a +13 multiplier for each hand. The Card Sharp boosts my score by three times if a poker hand has already been played this round. Since I’ve played a Two Pair, any future Two Pair will receive that multiplier. I’m considering trying to play Two Pair again, but I have three aces. However, I don’t have a good second pair. I do have spades for a possible flush! I need five spades, and I have six. So, I can play a flush without the Card Sharp bonus, since I haven’t played that combination yet.\n**Analyzing flush and straight possibilities**\n\nI realized we have only played a flush once overall, meaning we haven't played it in the current boss round. So, my first flush won’t get the x3 boost from Card Sharp. However, future flushes could. With three hands remaining, I could work towards more flushes, but a straight flush seems even better if I can get the 10s for a 7-8-9-10-J spade combo. Unfortunately, there's only one 10 left in the deck, and I have the 10d in hand, which is debuffed. This complicates my options.\n**Assessing my card probabilities**\n\nI’m weighing whether the remaining 10 in the deck could be either the 10 hearts or 10 spades. To achieve a straight flush, I really need the 10 spades, but that gives me a low probability, about one card out of 36. However, with five discards, I can cycle through and try to pull the 10 spades. Each discard does reduce my deck size and Blue Joker chips, but it might be worth the risk considering the potential payoffs from the straight flush. I can also play the flush with my lucky As and Js, which offers a +20 multiplier each. The flush approach might be the better first move, especially considering I need 37,718 chips and I can get big bonuses for repeats due to Card Sharp. I’ll calculate the expected score for the flush hand next.\n**Calculating expected flush outcomes**\n\nRight now, my Blue Joker is at +72, and Ice Cream gives me +95, reduced after each hand. If I play now, Ice Cream will still score +95. For my flush, with a base of 65 chips and a base multiplier of 8, I can sum my spades to reach 110 chips before jokers. Adding in the Blue Joker and Ice Cream brings me to 277 chips. The multipliers can elevate it, but I need to plan my plays wisely to keep spades for future flush attempts. I should focus on discarding non-spades while keeping high-value cards for later games. It’s tricky, but if I manage my hands well, I'm on track to meet my chip goals!\n**Planning my flush and discards**\n\nAfter playing the flush, I’ll keep my lucky Ace of spades and some other cards while targeting spades for the next hand. With five discards available, I can focus on getting more spades by discarding non-spade cards. However, the boss debuffs diamonds, so including them in a flush won’t yield chips. It seems best to proceed with the flush now to maximize the potential of Card Sharp for the remaining hands. \n\nAlso, I need to think about the order of my jokers and effect sequences since they may affect my strategy. Essentially, my plan for the flush is solid, and I’ll estimate around 5,650 chips for this play. Let's move forward with positions!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
