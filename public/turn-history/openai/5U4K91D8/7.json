I'm in the small blind with 120 chips, needing 300. I\\u2019ve got three 7s, an Ace, and a few low cards. I could go for a three of a kind with my 7s and play it safe for 153 chips, which would still leave me short. However, I'm also considering if I should aim for a full house, but it might be riskier. What should I do?\\n**Evaluating poker hand strategy**\\n\\nI'm considering whether to keep my three 7s and maybe the Ace of diamonds. If I discard the five other cards, drawing five new ones could give me a decent chance of getting a pair, which I need for a full house. The probability of drawing at least one pair from a 31-card deck is around 60%, which sounds promising. However, if I keep the three 7s and don't get that pair, I can still go with the three of a kind. But I\\u2019m unsure if discarding should be my move here.\\n**Determining optimal play strategy**\\n\\nI\\u2019m weighing my options with the small blind at 300 chips. Playing my three of a kind right now seems like the safe choice, but the total chips I get from it will depend on the cards I choose. If I use the 7s and maybe include the Ace, I end up with 153 chips. To reach my goal of 300, I might need to draw some new cards to aim for a pair or even a high card. I could potentially play two hands to make that 27 chips I still need!\\n**Exploring potential plays**\\n\\nI have two remaining hands to work with, and I\\u2019m considering how my high cards could contribute to reaching the total I need. If I manage to get 16 from a high card, I\\u2019ll still need 11 more cards to meet my goal. I can also think about playing three of a kind and possibly including the Ace, although it won't really help my score. Alternatively, I could aim for a flush since I already have four diamonds, which makes for an interesting option!\\n**Planning for a winning strategy**\\n\\nI need one more diamond for a flush, but my best option might be to play three of a kind with my 7s. I could aim for a full house if I successfully draw a pair, which gives me better potential for chips. Discarding my non-7 cards leaves me with five new draws. The probability of getting at least one pair in those five is around 58%, making this attempt look good! If I win with a full house, I\\u2019ll have extra hands left for a better payout.\\n**Deciding on discards and plays**\\n\\nI\\u2019m evaluating my options to maximize my chips. A full house gives me a solid chance to win, potentially bringing my score up to about 260 chips. Since I need at least 180 to win, that\\u2019s enough! While aiming for four of a kind is tempting, the probability isn't great, so I should focus on drawing a pair. The best move would be to discard my non-7 cards now. This keeps my options open for my next hand and still allows me to play with the three of a kind if necessary.\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 5 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 6]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 10 of Spades.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nselect <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> <hand_card_position2> ... <hand_card_positionN> - Select a card from the booster pack. The hand card positions may be required depending on if the booster pack card selected needs targets. In 'Mega' booster packs that say 'choose 2 of N', make the selections one at a time. If you intend to select cards 1 and 3 for example, issue a 'select 1' command, then a 'select 2' command, because the 3rd card position will become the second position after selecting the first card.\\nskip_booster - Skip the remaining selections in the current booster pack.\\n\\n#Task\\nAnalyze the total game state and context above, and respond with the appropriate action to take next.\"}",
