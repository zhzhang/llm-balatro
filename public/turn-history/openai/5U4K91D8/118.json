{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a shop purchase**\n\nI need to take the next action in the shop. We have space for consumables and The Magician costs 3, which seems manageable. It makes sense to buy it and hold it for future use. I think I should use the buy_card function to purchase and place it in consumables. Since we have $17, there's plenty to spare. The reroll cost of 10 isn't worth it right now, so I'll go ahead and buy The Magician.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
