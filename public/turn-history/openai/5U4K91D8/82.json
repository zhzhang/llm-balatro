{"reasoning":"**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nI need to choose whether to play the big blind or skip it for the Garbage tag worth $35. Since we've already skipped the small blind for the Orbital tag, that might mean I have no owned tags left. Orbital upgrades my hand but consumes itself. If I skip the big blind, I'll gain the Garbage tag that gives me cash, taking my total from $3 to $38, which would be a big increase. However, skipping means I won't shop before facing the boss.\n**Planning strategy against boss**\n\nThe boss has debuffed all Heart cards, which isn’t too concerning. I need 22,000 chips, and I’m considering whether I can reach that with my current deck. My previous maximum was around 5,940 chips with a Pair, but maybe I can do better with a Two Pair or Three of a Kind. I’m thinking about playing a decent Two Pair or Three of a Kind multiple times. The Blue Joker adds chips independently, and I need to maximize my multipliers from various cards. Using Card Sharp effectively could really boost my score!\n**Evaluating hand strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about my scoring potential: if the first hand scores between 7,000 to 10,000, the second could reach 20,000, making the total feasible to hit 22,000. Skipping the big blind for $35 seems wise since the big blind threshold is 16,500. Playing big could yield $4, and I might shop afterward. However, with only $7, my options are limited. Skipping guarantees the $35 for later use, which might help after facing the boss, but I’m weighing the risks carefully. If I fail against the boss, I could lose that $35 value.\n**Assessing boss battle chances**\n\nI need to evaluate my likelihood of beating the boss with my current jokers. For the ante 5 boss, I expect to have 22,000 chips and usually get four hands with two discards. If I need an average of 5,500 chips each, I've previously scored 5,900 with a pair against the ante 4 boss. The hearts are debuffed, which could affect my scoring if I rely on them. However, I can focus on spades, even ranks, and held queens. It may be challenging to reach 22,000, but it’s doable. Skipping the big blind might gain $35, while playing big blind could help me shop before the boss, which could be crucial.\n**Deciding on strategy against the boss**\n\nI’m weighing whether to play the big blind for a chance to shop later. While the $35 from skipping could buy multiple jokers and tarot after the boss, I wonder if playing the big blind might build interest. If I win with leftover hands, I could earn extra cash, but it seems I won’t reach $35. \n\nPlaying the big blind could let me shop for items to ensure a boss win. However, I’m currently behind since I skipped the small blind earlier, meaning I missed a shop opportunity. If I play big, I could find useful items like a tarot or voucher.\n\nHowever, the Garbage tag for $35 would provide immediate value, and I trust I can beat the boss without shopping. I’m also considering how debuffed hearts affect scores; they’ll only participate but not trigger enhancements or provide chips. So, I can avoid using hearts and skip this round.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
