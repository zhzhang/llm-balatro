{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategies**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy Neptune for a straight flush, but it might be better to keep my money. In the shop, I can't end the round but I can leave. We have $2 with no interest, but could I convert it to $1? Maybe keeping jokers is the way to go. It's important to think about the order for triggering them, as it matters for the scoring. The Blue Joker and other jokers seem to influence play independently. I need to keep track of how triggers work for scoring.\n**Weighing options for gameplay**\n\nI'm considering how the order of cards could impact gameplay, especially with multiple effects like multipliers and chips. The Business Card provides money but doesn’t affect scoring, while the Wrathful Joker adds a multiplier. Since I can’t buy right now, the simplest option might be to select a round. I wonder if I should sell the Showman for $4 to buy a Standard pack, but that feels risky. Selling the Business Card could work too, but it offers consistent benefits. Keeping it seems smarter!\n**Evaluating card decisions**\n\nI'm thinking about selling the Showman card since we already have five jokers, and I may want better ones later. While the Showman helps improve the chances of seeing duplicate jokers, it's not the strongest option. However, I should consider how the Wheel of Fortune might affect the random joker selection. The Blue Joker shows a consistent value, but I still think about scaling at ante3. Selling to buy Neptune seems risky since I might not truly need a straight flush. Losing the Showman doesn’t feel worth it.\n**Deciding on game moves**\n\nI’m starting to think that losing the Showman might not be the end of the world, but spending $3 on a planet card I might never use feels risky. The Standard pack could give me a stronger card to improve my flush, but I'm not entirely sure. Since I'm limited in information, I prefer to focus on building my current setup and proceeding with caution. So, I think my next action will be to select a round.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
