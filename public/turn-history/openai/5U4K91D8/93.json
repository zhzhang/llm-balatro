{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop purchases**\n\nI need to make some decisions with 47 money in the shop. Our inventory of jokers is full at five. I think buying the Paint Brush for +1 hand size might be crucial, as well as potentially some packs. My strategy involves playing pairs with kickers for certain cards. I should go ahead and buy the voucher first. Then, I can consider either the Arcana or Celestial pack for enhancing my deck and pair strategy.\n**Investing in shop options**\n\nThe Arcana pack could provide tarot cards like Death, Strength, or Hanged Man, and with the Tarot Merchant, I could double their frequency. Given that we're nearing ante 6 and the difficulty is increasing, it seems wise to invest now. However, I need to focus on one action for now. The immediate best move is to buy the Paint Brush voucher. I’ll go ahead and execute that action in position 1.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
