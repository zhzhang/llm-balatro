{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI'm figuring out the need to maintain at least $50 before the end of the round for interest calculations. If I spend now, it could reduce my future interest, though. My current build is strong since Blue Joker boosts chips with deck count, and I can leverage Shoot the Moon for a multiplier with queens in hand. Since I need an extra card, I should focus on retaining those queens for optimal play.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI'm focused on pairs, and Card Sharp rewards repeating the same hand type, which is great for our strategy. In the shop, there's Judgement for $3, which creates a random joker, but I'm at max capacity with five jokers. I'd need to sell one first. Considering Runner seems replaceable since it’s not contributing much right now. Selling Runner for $2 and using that to buy Judgement might net me a better joker, but there’s a risk of getting something undesirable.\n**Assessing card options**\n\nI’m considering the sell value for the Random Joker, which could range from $1 to $5. The risk seems minimal. The Moon costs $3 and converts up to three cards to Clubs, which could help if I aimed for flushes, but our current strategy isn’t flush-based; plus, Runner requires straights. I have consumables like Lovers and Death, but can't buy Moon or Judgement since they can't affect existing cards in my hand. I might need to sell or use something to free up space.\n**Analyzing purchasing options**\n\nIf I buy a card, it would go into my consumable inventory, which is already full. Since shop cards include tarot, and I'm at max capacity, I'd need to sell one of my consumables, like Lovers or Death, to buy Judgement or The Moon. If I use the buy-and-use option, I can get Judgement immediately without needing targets. However, I still need room in my inventory for the generated Joker, so I'd have to sell a joker first. The Moon can't be used immediately anyway, so it seems less valuable right now.\n**Deciding on next moves**\n\nThe best course of action seems to be selling Runner to open a joker slot, then buying and using Judgement to gain a new joker. Since only one action can be taken per turn, selling Runner first makes sense, as it clears up room for Judgement. Although I could reroll for a better joker, the cost is high, and I’d still need to sell something. With my current funds at $48, it’ll help with interest. Overall, selling Runner looks like the right play, especially since I'd benefit more from other jokers in the future.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
