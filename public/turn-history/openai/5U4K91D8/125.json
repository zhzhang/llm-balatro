{"reasoning":"**Evaluating poker hand potential**\n\nI see that I have a strong potential for a straight flush in spades: A♠ J♠ 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 3♠. However, I can't complete a straight flush without the 10♠. I could aim for a flush with A, J, 9, 8, and 7 in spades, which looks better than just two pair. Also, if I play two pair again, I could boost the multiplier with Card Sharp activating, but I need another pair to make that work effectively.\n**Examining potential plays**\n\nI can create a pair of Aces (A♠ and A♣) and think about adding another pair, but I only have one 7 and one 9. So that's not a strong option. If I play a flush now, it won't activate Card Sharp, but I could aim for another flush later with a multiplier. However, I have to consider time since there are only three hands left. I could also choose to attempt a straight, but I'm missing the 10. Discarding cards could help, but I need to clarify how it affects the deck size.\n**Understanding card mechanics**\n\nI realize that in the game, discarding cards moves them to the discard pile, which decreases the deck size. It's interesting how those cards can be reshuffled when the deck is empty, but for now, I see there are 36 cards left. Each card removed affects the Blue Joker's value, dropping it by 2, which is a small but notable detail since I need to score. \n\nI might want to use the Magician skill to make two cards Lucky, focusing on those likely to score big in a flush, like A♠ and J♠ or A♠ and A♣. The Lucky trigger boosts odds in high-multiplier hands, especially if I plan to aim for a flush or straight flush. To really maximize my potential, I think I need those big multipliers from Shoot the Moon and Card Sharp.\n**Calculating multipliers and chips**\n\nI’ve got just 1 queen, which gives me a +13 multiplier. The base multiplier for a flush is 8, so that totals 21. With Card Sharp for the next flush, I could reach a multiplier of 63. The base chips for the flush are 65, plus card values adding up to 110, leading to a total of 277 chips. After multiplying, I’m at 5,817, but that’s not enough. \n\nIf I consider a second flush with Card Sharp, it might yield even more chips, but I see Ice Cream decreasing with each hand played. After a flush, I can expect similar values of chips but to calculate it accurately, I think I might still come up short by 15,395, even with a potential third hand. I wonder if I can still get that Card Sharp multiplier again?\n**Strategizing for the next moves**\n\nI realize CardSharp will give me a x3 multiplier for any flush I play after using it. That's great because I can aim for a third flush with a significant multiplier. To plan effectively, I think I should play a flush now to set up x3 for the remaining hands. \n\nIt might be possible to draw the needed 10♠ to create a straight flush, but I know there's only one 10 left in the deck. I need to decide whether to discard some non-spade cards to increase my chances of drawing that 10♠ or play my current flush of A, J, 9, 8, and 7. \n\nUsing the Magician on A♠ and J♠ to make them Lucky seems like a good move because it could boost my multiplier significantly. I will decide to use the Magician now, enhancing those two cards before I play the flush. This could really help maximize my points in this round!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,1,2]"}
