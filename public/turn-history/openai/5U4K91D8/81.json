{"reasoning":"**Evaluating poker strategy**\n\nI need to decide whether to play or skip the small blind with the Orbital tag upgrade that increases a hand by three levels. I believe this upgrade applies to a random hand type in Balatro, but I'm uncertain if it shows a specific poker hand when the tag appears. The prompt seems to suggest it's blank. Skipping the small blind won't yield a shop, but I could gain a powerful tag for future play, potentially leading to significant rewards!\n**Considering poker strategies**\n\nSkipping both the small and big blind could yield two tags but with no shop available. Then, I’d face a boss at ante5 with 22k; I’m thinking I could beat the boss since I scored 4-6k on previous pairs. The tags might really help, especially with the Orbital tag upgrading hands by three levels. If I get a Garbage tag, it offers immediate payouts of $35, but skipping the big blind might mean I miss the chance to shop afterward!\n**Planning poker strategy**\n\nIf I decide to skip the small blind, I then have to decide about the big blind, but skipping the big blind leads directly to the boss round without a shop. With the Garbage tag, any money gained carries over to the boss, but I can't spend it until after the boss battle. I need to reach 22k with debuffed hearts using my current build, which includes various bonuses. My plan is to play the same hand type twice to maximize multipliers. I’m hoping to reach the 22k goal in four or five hands!\n**Evaluating poker strategy**\n\nIf a good Two Pair yields about 6k, I need to get to 22k over several hands, which seems doable in 3-4 hands. However, skipping both the small and big blinds means I miss out on reward money and possibly practice. Those lower thresholds of 11k and 16.5k seem easy to clear, especially since shops occur after beating each blind. If I win playing the small blind, I can shop, spend money, and even buy a tarot card to enhance my deck. That could be really useful!\n**Deciding on poker moves**\n\nI'm weighing the choice of skipping the big blind to get $35 versus the potential shop opportunity. Although $35 is significant, failing to prepare properly for the boss might hinder me. With my current build, I believe I can reach 22k against the boss. If I skip the small blind for the Orbital tag, it could upgrade a hand significantly, but I must consider if it’ll still be useful. I plan to skip the small blind to preserve the chance for greater rewards!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
