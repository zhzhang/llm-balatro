{"reasoning":"**Considering consumable strategy**\n\nLet's compute my options: buying Fool for $3 leaves me with $37, which I can then use to create Hermit. If Hermit doubles my money up to a maximum of $20, that adds $20 to my $37, totaling $57, which is a nice net gain of $17 from spending $3. However, it uses a consumable slot. I can use Hermit right after generating it, freeing up the slot. The best first step seems to be to buy and use Fool.\n**Planning next actions**\n\nI’m considering which tarots to get to improve my deck ranks, particularly queens for techniques like Shoot the Moon, or even for creating more queens. Using Emperor could get me powerful tarots, but it’s random. I think the best move is to buy and use Fool now, which will help create Hermit. Then for the next step, I can use Hermit or buy Emperor. It’s beneficial to buy Fool and use it immediately to avoid wasting a consumable slot.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
