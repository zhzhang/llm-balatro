{"reasoning":"**Calculating strategy with Gift Card**\n\nI’m at 7 out of 8 antes currently. I need to beat the big ante then the small one to win. With the Gift Card, selling after each round could increase the value of my jokers and consumables, adding $1 per item. That totals to an extra $30 after 5 rounds. However, I wonder if I really need the money since I can’t buy more jokers. It may be better to focus on rerolls and boosters instead.\n**Considering Gift Card strategy**\n\nBuying the Gift Card is like using a joker since we already have the maximum. I’d need to sell one joker, like the Walkie, to make space, which could hurt my scoring potential. In the late game, that might not pay off unless I’m overpowered. \n\nI see that for ante 7, I needed around 35k, and we managed to do that. Future blinds will demand more—like 50k or even 70k. I need to focus on keeping my scoring jokers instead of replacing them for economic reasons.\n**Deciding against the Gift Card**\n\nI’ve decided not to buy the Gift Card since it doesn't allow for other actions. Instead, I might rearrange my jokers for better activation order. The important thing is how independent jokers trigger from left to right. For instance, the Blue Joker and Ice Cream add chips, while Card Sharp multiplies independently. \n\nThe Walkie Talkie triggers on scored cards, affected by ranks, and polychrome editions act independently with a 1.5 multiplier. Better order and timing could maximize my score!\n**Evaluating multipliers and actions**\n\nI’m considering how the order affects the multipliers among independent categories. In Balatro, additive multipliers (+) are applied first before multiplicative ones (x), so that’s important to remember. For me, the Card Sharp gives a x3 multiplier while Walkie gives a x1.5, but there are no additive multipliers besides the ones from Walkie and Shoot the Moon. \n\nThese happen before independent multipliers, so that’s okay. I’ve decided the best action is to select a round. I should also consider keeping the Sun instead of selling it. I'll respond with an action for round selection and provide the JSON format.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
