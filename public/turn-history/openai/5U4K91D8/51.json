{"reasoning":"**Evaluating poker strategy**\n\nI need to take action from the big blind with 3000 chips and four discards to consider. Looking at my hand: Q♠ J♠ 6♠ 4♠ Q♥ 3♥ 7♦ 5♦, I've got some interesting components like jokers and multipliers. I'm aiming for a strong hand, preferably aiming for a straight since I have a nice 5-card sequence (3♥ 4♠ 5♦ 6♠ 7♦). This could give me a significant multiplier based on my cards!\n**Calculating chip values**\n\nIf my straight includes cards like 4♠ and 6♠, then I get bonus multipliers from my jokers! Wrathful gives me +3 for each spade scored, and Even Steven adds +4 for both 4 and 6. Each card also contributes its chip values, so I have a base of 30 chips for the straight plus additional values (3+4+5+6+7=25), totaling 55. Adding the Blue Joker's independent bonus of +88 brings my total chips to 143, with additional multipliers from the spade cards.\n**Calculating final multipliers**\n\nSo, my total multiplier looks like it will be base 4 plus 14, making it 18. With Shoot the Moon counting the queens I hold, if I play a straight from 3 to 7 while keeping the queens, I get an additional +26 multiplier. This brings my grand total to 44! However, I can't trigger the Business Card since I don't have any face cards in the straight. If I multiply 143 by 44, I get 6292, which exceeds my goal of 3000! Just need to confirm that I still keep the queens in hand. If I play 3-4-5-6-7, then I do! But, hmm, what's the deal with any flush? I have 4 spades. I would need one more for a flush, so a straight flush isn’t an option.\n**Planning the card play**\n\nThe best strategy here is to play a straight while keeping the queens in hand to significantly boost the multiplier. So, I’m thinking of playing the cards in the indices of 3♥ (6), 4♠ (4), 5♦ (8), 6♠ (3), and 7♦ (7) from left to right for scoring. The order doesn’t affect chip values, but it could for business money, though that’s not my priority. I’ll estimate my total chips will be around 6200. Now to craft the final JSON with my action to play, including the positions [6, 4, 8, 3, 7] and labeling the intended hand type as \"straight.\"\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [6,4,8,3,7]"}
