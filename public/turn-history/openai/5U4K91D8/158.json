{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI might choose Jupiter, or I could upgrade the flush instead. I'm unsure if my current options will include Jupiter in the jumbo pack, which allows for selecting up to 5 planets, based on what I've played most. The Arcana pack could provide useful tarots for deck shaping, like Death or Strength. Since we're at ante 7 of 8, needing power for the final boss sounds crucial. Buying Fibonacci as a strong multiplier for $8 seems like a smart move, leaving me with $4 for the Arcana pack. I'll opt to buy the Fibonacci card next.\n**Deciding actions**\n\nI think buying the booster is probably the best approach after this. I also need to consider that rerolling the shop costs $5. Since I have $12, I could reroll, but that feels unnecessary because my options are already great. So, my action will be to buy the card in position 1. I’ll return a JSON response with the action \"buy_card\" and the position [1], without specifying any intended hand type.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
