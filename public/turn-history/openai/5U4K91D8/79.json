{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI need to choose a planet from the Celestial pack: Earth for a full house, Venus for three of a kind, or Uranus for two pair. My current strategy seems to lean heavily on pairs, but two pair has a solid level 5 and has been played 7 times, which makes it my main scoring option. I might pivot to two pair for better base scoring and multiplier opportunities, since it uses more cards and triggers more scoring effects from powers like Wrathful and Even Steven.\n**Considering planet selection**\n\nI’m pondering whether my deck supports consistent two pair. The level 5 indicates potential, but recent hands have mostly been pairs, probably because they were easier. Given my planet options, Uranus enhances two pair with a +20 chips and +1 multiplier, which feels like the best choice since it’s already strong. Earth boosts full house but is harder to achieve. So, I’ll go with Uranus. In Balatro, selecting a planet from the pack happens immediately, so I’ll command: select 3.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
