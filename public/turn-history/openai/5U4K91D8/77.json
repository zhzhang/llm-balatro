{"reasoning":"**Considering purchases for a game**\n\nI’m in a shop with $17 and need to decide on purchases for my current build. Available options include To Do List joker for $4, Jumbo Standard for $6, Celestial pack for $4, and Seed Money voucher for $10. My build focuses on pair spam with specific card strategies. Given my needs, I must consider selling a less useful joker to make room. It could be Even Steven or Wrathful, depending on my deck composition.\n**Deciding on purchases for strategy**\n\nI primarily focus on making pairs, as the suit and rank bonuses apply only to the cards I'm playing in a scoring hand. Holding queens with Shoot the Moon offers a huge multiplier, and Card Sharp is essential for my strategy. I’m considering dropping either Even Steven or Wrathful. \n\nBuying the Seed Money voucher for $10 seems like the best option, as it enhances my economy while leaving me with $7. With that, I could also consider the Celestial pack or To Do List for leveling up my hands later. For now, buying the voucher seems most beneficial.\n**Weighing value of options**\n\nI’m considering whether the To Do List might actually be more valuable than the Seed Money voucher. To Do List gives $4 per round if I play a certain hand, which could be better than the interest cap at $5. But it costs a joker slot, which makes it tricky. With $17, the Seed Money could raise the interest cap to $10, but holding over $25 would earn more interest.\n\nTo Do List offers consistent returns if I can meet the hand requirement. However, it changes each round and could become more challenging later. Right now, it’s aligned with my current strategy since a Pair is required.\n**Planning for chip scaling and purchases**\n\nTo scale my strategy to beat ante 5+, I need stronger chips or multipliers. A Celestial pack could provide beneficial planets, but I need to remember which corresponds to which hands. For example, I’ve already used Mercury for a Pair, and I think Jupiter might be two pairs. \n\nI do have $17, and while I can buy the Seed Money voucher later, I want to ensure it doesn’t disappear. Buying the voucher now will help ensure stronger economic growth during the remaining antes. I'll go ahead and take action: buy_voucher to secure my long-term strategy. I'll prepare the output in the required JSON format.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
