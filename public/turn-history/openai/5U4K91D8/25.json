{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchase**\n\nI'm in a shop with $4 to spend. I see the Crazy Joker for $4, but other options like boosters and vouchers are too expensive, and I can’t afford the $5 reroll. I’m debating whether to buy the Crazy Joker or save my money. \n\nThe Blue Joker gives +2 chips per card in the deck. I think the deck size is currently 52 cards and resets after rounds. The Blue Joker seems powerful for winning. The Crazy Joker could help with multiplies if I get a straight but for now, I'm focusing on holding queens.\n**Planning for the boss round**\n\nI have a boss coming up that requires me to play only one type of hand for that round. I just cleared the small blind, and now we'll play the big blind and then the boss. The one-hand-type restriction applies only to the boss blind. \n\nFor the boss, I’m considering playing a consistent hand type, likely aiming for a Two Pair or a Full House. The Crazy Joker suggests a Straight, but building a Straight could be trickier than achieving a Two Pair, even though I can still make it work with my current chips.\n**Evaluating purchases and strategy**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy something for $4. Currently, I have no other purchases planned, and this could help with a reroll—but maybe not. I need to think about keeping my economy stable: starting with $4 in ante2 could help when the big blind hits. If I don’t buy anything, I could use that $4 to work towards $5 for interest.\n\nAlso, if I sell the Showman, I may reach $6 for a Jumbo Standard pack. I'm unsure if the Jumbo Standard pack is worth it since it only adds one card. It might be better to save for packs or vouchers instead. So, my best option seems to be to leave the shop and keep my $4.\n**Considering pack options**\n\nI'm looking at the Standard pack, which might give me random playing cards, possibly allowing me to add extra Queens or other useful cards. It adds base cards, and I can choose one card from five, which could be great if I can pick a Queen or maybe a King. It costs $6, and I could sell the Showman to afford it. \n\nHowever, the Showman might be beneficial later for increasing chances of duplicates. Getting more Queens would help with my Shoot the Moon strategy, but buying the pack now would leave me broke. It might be wiser to hold onto the Showman and wait for a better pack, like Arcana or Celestial, even though I can't reroll or have any consumables right now. The Showman could help in seeing more options like The Moon, which feels important.\n**Evaluating choices for card packs**\n\nI’m considering whether to sell the Showman for $2 to increase my funds to $6, which would allow me to buy the Jumbo Standard pack. That would let me choose a card, and if a Queen is available, it could be a huge benefit. However, I worry about giving up the Showman since it helps with duplicates and might be valuable later. \n\nI could wait until after the big blind to see if I can accumulate more money, potentially reaching $13! That would afford me the chance to buy packs and still reroll without sacrificing the Showman. So it seems best to keep my cash and leave. For now, I'll focus on getting ready for the round ahead.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
