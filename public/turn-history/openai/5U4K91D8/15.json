{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop strategy**\n\nI'm in the shop after choosing Uranus from the celestial pack, and I have two pairs at level 3. My money is at $2. The shop items include a Fortune Teller for $6, Pluto for $3, a standard pack for $4, a blank for $10, and a reroll for $5, but I can't afford anything. I guess I'll end the shop with round_select. Next is likely a boss round, and I remember there are debuffs. I shouldn't sell the Blue Joker; it's powerful.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
