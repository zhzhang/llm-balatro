{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI’m at a shop with $7, considering buying the To Do List for $4, but I’d need to sell a joker since I’m full on slots. The To Do List pays $4 when I play a Pair, which I do reliably. It could help my economy, but it takes a slot. I have a few jokers, with Wrathful and Even Steven seeming less valuable compared to the others. I wonder if I should buy the Celestial pack instead, which costs 4 and gives a planet right away.\n**Deciding on a booster purchase**\n\nI think buying the Celestial pack is the best option since it provides immediate power without taking a joker slot. With $7, after purchasing, I’ll have $3 left. The Jumbo Standard pack costs $6 and only adds a card, which doesn’t seem beneficial. Rerolling costs $5, leaving me with just $2, so I’ll focus on the Celestial pack. After the purchase, the game will show my choices, but that’s a decision for later!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
