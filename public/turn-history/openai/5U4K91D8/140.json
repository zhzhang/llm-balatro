{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m in a shop with $1, but the only item, Strength, costs $3, which I can’t afford. I can’t sell boosters or pay to reroll. I wonder if selling a joker could help me buy Strength, which upgrades the rank of two selected cards. It might be useful for increasing the value of my hand, but I’m unsure about my deck composition. Keeping Queens offers a great multiplier, and the Walkie Talkie adds bonuses, so I need to weigh my options.\n**Considering sale options**\n\nThe Blue Joker is likely strong enough to give chips based on deck size, around +104. Selling it for Strength doesn’t seem worth losing that permanent effect. Maybe I should consider selling Ice Cream instead, as it decays with each hand played. By turn 140, it might be significantly reduced. However, I’m unsure about its current worth—it might still retain that +80 base. Selling Shoot the Moon seems unwise since the Blue Joker and Card Sharp offer significant multipliers. Ice Cream is my only potential candidate for sale, but I’m uncertain about that choice.\n**Evaluating Ice Cream sale**\n\nIf I sell Ice Cream for $2, I'd have $3 to buy Strength and still keep four jokers. However, Strength is a consumable tarot card that requires targets in hand when used. I can't use it immediately without seeing my hand, leaving me with $0 afterward. Holding onto it for the next round might be wise. Selling Ice Cream might be worth it since it decays, but every chip matters. With Blue Joker giving +104 and Ice Cream providing +80, that’s a possible 184 chips, which is significant!\n**Weighing Ice Cream's value**\n\nIce Cream is an independent joker that adds chips, especially at a later step, which could be beneficial, but if it decays too low, its value drops. As we approach ante 7, scaling becomes essential, and Strength might help by turning Jacks into Queens, boosting our multipliers. It can also shift any cards, not just Jacks. At $1, I can only buy if I sell something, but maintaining my economy is important. Immediate purchases might help, but I'm unsure if I've already secured a win.\n**Assessing next steps**\n\nWait, so we’re in Ante 7/8 during Round 13, which suggests we might be in a shop after a blind. I’ll need to select a blind within Ante 7 next. Surviving the upcoming blinds is essential since bosses can be tough. The next blind details aren't clear; I’ll have to round_select to make a choice. While having Strength could help slightly, it’s not guaranteed, so I should avoid sacrificing a joker. I think selling nothing and continuing is the best option. I’ll proceed with round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
