{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy with Popcorn**\n\nPopcorn starts with a +20 boost but decreases by -4 each round. Over the next couple of rounds, I estimate an average gain of around 12, which is still above 8. If there are more than 3 rounds, it'll eventually drop to lower values, like 8 and below. Even so, having Popcorn is beneficial as it pairs with any rank, giving me more options. I think it's better to buy Popcorn and sell Even Steven. If I sell Even, I’ll get +2, but I’ll be cautious about the reroll costs.\n**Considering endgame strategy**\n\nPopcorn provides decent power for the endgame, and I think I should go for it. However, the first step is to sell a joker before buying a card, as I can only take one action per turn. Selling the joker for Even Steven seems to be the appropriate action, followed by buying a card. I'm also thinking about the order of jokers for scoring; it's important to place the additive multipliers before the x multipliers to optimize their effects in Balatro.\n**Planning joker arrangement and purchases**\n\nCard Sharp multiplies the multiplier by 3 under certain conditions, so it should be positioned rightmost for maximum effect after all the additive multipliers. I'm considering how to arrange the jokers, but for now, my focus is on purchasing. I wonder if I should sell Ice Cream, which sells for 2, and replace it with Popcorn instead for better long-term benefits. After running the calculations, it looks like replacing Even Steven is the way to go. My next action will be to sell the joker, then buy Popcorn. Let's move forward!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
