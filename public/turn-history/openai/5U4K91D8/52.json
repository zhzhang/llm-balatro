{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card multipliers**\n\nOur even/spade multipliers still apply to numbered cards, but Shoot the Moon might be tricky since identifying queens can be challenging. I think discarding could help. It seems better to buy the Card Sharp x3 multiplier if the same hand type is played twice in a round because it can provide a significant boost, especially with two pair hands. For the boss level, I could consider starting with a small hand to fulfill the multiplier requirement, but since face cards are face down, I might miss out on extra multipliers.\n**Considering card strategy**\n\nI can still form straights and two pairs with numbered cards, and using Card Sharp would be helpful if we need two hands. Venus levels work for three of a kind, but since we mainly play two pairs and straights or flushes, it's not as beneficial. The Director's Cut voucher could let us reroll a boss, but it costs $10, which is all my current funds. It’s probably better to spend $6 on Card Sharp and keep $4 for a standard pack, which might give us better card options. We need to check what's offered in the pack first.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nIt costs $4 to add one card, but I'll need to sell a joker to make space, as I can only have a maximum of five jokers. I should consider which one to sell. \n\nThe Blue Joker adds +104 chips if there are 52 cards in the deck, but it seems to update based on deck size. Since I could draw from 44 cards, it’s valuable as the deck remains large. \n\nShoot the Moon gives a +13 multiplier for each Queen held, but with face-down bosses, it’s uncertain. There are currently 2 Queens remaining in the deck, but I need to keep track as it updates with each draw.\n**Deciding on jokers to sell**\n\nThis joker can give a +26 multiplier if I hold two Queens, which is pretty useful. The Business Card generates money, but with face cards hidden by bosses, its value may decrease. Still, money can be helpful. \n\nThe Wrathful Joker, providing +3 multiplier per spade played, seems valuable since I often play spades. Then there’s Even Steven, which offers a +4 multiplier for even ranks, and my straights include evens. \n\nI think the Business Card is the least impactful and I’d consider selling it to make space. We may lose some money potential, but I believe it’s a good trade-off for scoring with Card Sharp.\n**Planning joker transactions**\n\nI’m considering the reliance on face cards since later bosses might debuff them, but I still find value in them, especially with my strategy of playing straights while holding Queens. I’ve decided to sell the Business Card first to free up space for Card Sharp later; that’s my immediate action. \n\nI can’t do both sell and buy at once, but I need to be mindful of joker ordering. Card Sharp is independent and should probably go last to maximize multipliers, especially since it gives a x3 multiplier on repeated hands. I think I'll go ahead with selling the Business Card.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
