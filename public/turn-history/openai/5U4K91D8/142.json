{"reasoning":"**Analyzing poker strategy**\n\nI need a plan for a hand with strong jokers and a total of 35,000 chips. The current hand has cards that could form a straight, but I need a 6 or a J for that. However, I can make two pairs with 7s and 8s, using 7♣, 7♦, and 8♠ along with my kicker, 10♠. The scoring involves base chips and additional card chips, so I need to calculate that too.\n**Calculating chip modifiers**\n\nI need to figure out the total chips before adding modifiers, which comes to 160 chips. The Blue Joker adds 86 chips, and if the Ice Cream adds 80 chips minus 5 for each hand played, I’ll assume around 80 hands were played since I don't have exact info. \n\nThe Walkie Talkie can add chips for certain plays, and both it and the polychrome edition have a separate multiplier effect of x1.5. So, the calculations for multipliers could get a bit complex!\n**Calculating scoring potential**\n\nSo, I see that \"Shoot the Moon\" gives a +13 multiplier for each Queen, but we don’t have any Queens in hand, which isn't helpful. To reach the needed 35,000, our typical two pair scores look low, so I need to estimate multipliers. With a base multiplier of 7, adding +4 from Walkie Talkie brings it to 11. Then with the polychrome multiplier, it goes to 16.5. \n\nStarting with 160 chips, plus contributions from the jokers and Walkie Talkie, I get a total of 336. That multiplied by 16.5 gives me 5,544, which isn’t enough! To improve, I should focus on completing a flush using the four spades I have. Discarding some cards to draw a spade might help!\n**Planning the next move**\n\nSince I'm in the small blind, I have four hands and four discards available. It’s definitely a good strategy to use discards to aim for a spade, in order to build a strong flush or straight. Although my two pairs are high, they’re not enough for the 35k target. I think activating Card Sharp could help since it triples the multiplier. I currently have four spades, so I should keep those, but I might discard the other non-spade cards to try and draw a spade or two. Let's hope for some luck!\n**Evaluating hand strategies**\n\nThere are 12 spades left in the deck, and the probability of drawing at least one in five draws is around 82%. If I discard five non-spade cards while keeping four spades, I can work towards a flush. However, to reach the 35k target, I might need to use Card Sharp, as it can triple the multiplier. I should think about playing a weak hand first to set up for a stronger flush later. \n\nIt looks like I’ll aim to pull in more queens, as they offer a significant multiplier. Given my current hand has none, it complicates things. I might have to strategize around small hands and monster flushes if I want to maximize my score. We need to be clever with discarding and drawing to make this work!\n**Planning card discards**\n\nAlright, if I can draw three queens and avoid playing them, that could dramatically increase my multiplier by +39. So, I definitely want to prioritize queens in my hand. The probability of drawing a queen isn't great, around 31%, but I can use my discards to increase my chances. \n\nWhile I consider playing a minimal hand with synergy between 10s and 4s, it seems better to focus on discarding cards that won't help me find queens or spades. I'll discard 5 cards to maximize my chances of drawing the right ones. Let's go ahead and discard the least helpful cards!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8,9]"}
