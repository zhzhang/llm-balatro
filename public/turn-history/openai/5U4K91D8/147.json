{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm in the shop with $5 after beating the small blind ante. I'm looking at options: The Sun tarot card for $3, which would help me create hearts flushes, or a standard pack for $4. The Gift Card joker and jumbo spectral pack are out of my budget. The Sun seems beneficial for converting cards; however, I'd need to select from my hand, which I don't have right now. I could buy The Sun as it fits with my strategy for later use.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy a standard pack for $4 or The Sun tarot card for $3. The standard pack would randomize three cards and let me choose one but feels uncertain. The Sun seems reliable and affordable, leaving me with $2. I might want to reroll, but it costs $5 and would wipe my funds. I can't get the celestial pack now, and there's a risk of limited options with my current money. I think I'll go with The Sun since it fits my strategy best.\n**Analyzing chip strategy**\n\nI need to consider how the ante7 big and boss will impact chip requirements. The Blue Joker scales with deck size, but adding more cards seems confusing at first. Wait, it actually gives +2 chips for each remaining card, so more cards actually help! Adding a standard pack increases the deck size by one, which boosts the Blue Joker. Right now, it shows +104, meaning there are 52 cards left in the deck. I'm just trying to make sense of the deck size changes after reshuffles, and The Sun doesn't affect that at all.\n**Choosing card purchases**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy the standard pack, which could add a useful card or enhancement, but it's random. I definitely need the funds for boosters but can't afford the spectral one. The standard pack lets me choose one card from up to three, which might include enhancements. The Sun is appealing because it can convert up to three selected cards into hearts permanently. This is fantastic for my flush strategy, allowing me to convert high-value cards like 10s and 4s into hearts. So, I'll buy The Sun now!\n**Deciding on card purchase and strategy**\n\nSince I don't have a hand view, I can't target specific cards directly. Buying The Sun will add it to my consumables inventory for later use. There's a buy_and_use option, but The Sun needs targets, so I can't do that. I'm debating whether to reroll for planets, which would help my flush strategy, but they usually cost three and I need a celestial pack for that. Selling my Ice Cream could increase my chips, but I can't afford the Gift Card for better sell value. So, I’ll go ahead and buy The Sun.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
