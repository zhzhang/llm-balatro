{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm stuck at the blind select boss, and it seems I can't skip this part. I need to play a round, but I’m thinking about rearranging my jokers first. It looks like I'm allowed to do that. During this phase, effects from cards held in hand come into play, especially with the Shoot the Moon card. Since the order of jokers matters less because I only have that one, I can go ahead and proceed with the round, keeping my consumables in mind.\n**Finalizing game action**\n\nIn the blind select, I don’t have any cards in hand to target, so I can't use that option. Unless the game allows me to target cards on the deck? But I think I need the selected cards in hand for the round. So, I can't do that. I should just proceed with the play round. I need to respond in JSON action format. My hand type is either pair or two pair, so I can set it to pair. Alright, let's play the round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
