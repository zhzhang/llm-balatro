{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop actions**\n\nI need to figure out my next action at the shop. I have a full stock of jokers, and the shop has options like Runner, boosters for arcana, and celestial. The great thing is that buying boosters doesn't affect my jokers since they're considered consumables. So, having tarot merchants makes the arcana valuable, and celestial could give me useful planets. With my current build focused on pairs, I think Mercury would help my upgrades, plus I still want to use tarot to enhance my deck!\n**Evaluating purchases**\n\nI realize that spending $10 reduces my interest by $2, but that’s still alright. I’m considering whether to reroll for a better joker, but I already have full jokers. Selling them could work, but I might just stick with my current ones. Runner doesn’t seem useful, so I’ll ignore that. I’m thinking about whether to buy the Celestial Pack or arcana first. The order doesn’t matter much, so I’ll go with Celestial Pack to aim for Mercury for my pair upgrades!\n**Considering upgrade strategies**\n\nSo, my Two Pair is already at level 6 with 120 chips and a 7x multiplier, but I might not play it often since my build focuses on pairs. Upgrading the pair seems beneficial, especially since the Celestial Pack is affordable. After that, I can buy the Jumbo Arcana pack. I could use tarot abilities like Strength to create queens and Death to duplicate them, but thinning my deck with Hanged Man might not be wise since it could hurt my Blue Joker's effectiveness. I need to be cautious about that!\n**Choosing tarot and boosting strategies**\n\nI need to avoid card removal and focus on picking tarot that enhances or upgrades my deck. The Fool can duplicate the last used tarot, which sounds useful, but I’ll decide on that later. For now, I want to buy booster 2, which is the celestial pack. I also want to rearrange the order of my jokers to maximize effectiveness. It seems better to place additive multipliers first and then multiplicative ones. So, the order should be Blue Joker, Shoot, Even Steven, Card Sharp, and Flower Pot. That looks good!\n**Preparing to buy booster**\n\nAlright, I’m set to take the action of purchasing booster 2. I know I need to format this as JSON for the transaction, so I’ll make sure to get that right. Keeping everything organized will help avoid any mistakes! I'll focus on getting the details correct, and then I can proceed with making the purchase smoothly. Let’s get this done!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
