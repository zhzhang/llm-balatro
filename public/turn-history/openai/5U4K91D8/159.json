{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a purchase**\n\nI'm in a shop with $4, considering my options. The Arcana pack is $4, but the jumbo celestial costs $6, which I can't afford. I can't afford a reroll either since that costs 5. Buying the Arcana pack seems like a good idea because it may provide helpful tarot cards and increase my power. Plus, I don't have any capacity issues. So, I’ll go ahead and buy the Arcana pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
