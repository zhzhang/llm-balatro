{"reasoning":"**Weighing reroll options**\n\nI'm thinking about how my current strategy involves blue jokers and ice cream with chips. The order doesn't matter since chips and multiplication are separate. If someone multiplies chips, that's a different story. Right now, I have 35 money and can reroll for $8. I wonder if it’s better to save for a booster instead, but I definitely want stronger jokers. The reroll could help generate new items since the shop is currently empty after my last purchase. Balancing this economy feels crucial!\n**Considering spending and strategy**\n\nI'm evaluating my current situation. I have 35 money, and my interest cap is 50. If I keep at least 25, I can earn 5 in interest, but I see that with my 35, I'll end up with 7 interest at the end. Spending 8 drops me to 27, which means I’ll only get 5 interest. The opportunity cost seems like a loss of 2 interest, but I might find better planets or tarot cards. My build relies on holding queens and pairs, so I should consider rerolling to see more items, especially since it feels like early in the game.\n**Assessing reroll strategies**\n\nI’m considering the reroll cost of 8 and how a tarot merchant could help by adding more tarot options. My consumable slots are full, but theoretically, I could buy tarot and use it immediately. However, it seems that if my slots are full, I can't add new cards. The Lovers and Death are great options, but I can't use them in the shop since I have no hand there. Selling a card to free up a slot seems like a good idea, but what if I need the money? I wonder if skipping the reroll to save money makes sense, yet I feel I should try a few rerolls to find something valuable.\n**Planning actions in the shop**\n\nI can only take one action per turn, so I should choose to use the reroll shop. However, it makes sense to rearrange my jokers first since that’s a free action that doesn’t cost anything. I can still reroll on the next turn, so I really should do the rearrangement now to set myself up for success later. This requires action JSON for rearranging the jokers in the correct order. My current order is 1 Blue, 2 Shoot Moon, 3 Card Sharp, 4 Ice Cream, and 5 Popcorn. Time to get organized!\n**Arranging my jokers**\n\nI want to rearrange my jokers in the order of Shoot Moon, Blue, Ice Cream, Popcorn, and Card Sharp. The desired indices for this arrangement are 2, 1, 4, 5, and 3. I’m ready to proceed with this new order to optimize my strategy! Time to execute the rearrangement, and I’ll feel much better knowing my jokers are set up just right for the next moves ahead. Let's make it happen!\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [2,1,4,5,3]"}
