{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy options**\n\nI'm at a decision point regarding the big blind ante. Skipping could give me a free uncommon joker in the shop, but it also means missing a chance to play. If I skip, I'll remain in the blind select for the next round but won’t have a shopping opportunity right away. The tag indicates I'll receive a free uncommon joker after I complete the boss round. It feels like a strategic choice, but I also need to consider the money loss.\n**Considering gameplay strategy**\n\nIf I decide to skip the big blind, I can still face the boss for a $5 reward. However, playing the big blind allows me to earn more money and access the shop beforehand. After every blind round, I can shop, which is crucial since it lets me buy items before facing the boss. If I skip, I miss that opportunity. I feel strong with my cards, but the restriction of playing only one hand type makes me think a bit harder about my next move.\n**Weighing options for big blind**\n\nI could win the big blind in one hand, which would also provide an opportunity to shop for leveling up items and tarots. However, skipping offers a free uncommon joker that might be valuable. But if I miss the shop, I might not be prepared for the boss fight, and skipping the big blind means I won't earn any interest from leftover hands. It's a tough choice—$4 reward and a potential shop versus the uncommon joker. I need to consider the overall value!\n**Evaluating potential rewards**\n\nIf I can win in one hand, I'm considering that I might have about three remaining hands to play, possibly four. With a winning hand, I could end up with around $11-$12 to spend in the shop before facing the boss, which would allow me to buy booster packs or items. That might be worth more than the free uncommon joker I'd get later. However, the joker itself is valued at $6, and I could potentially buy other items too. I need to weigh these options carefully!\n**Determining optimal gameplay strategy**\n\nIn considering my options, I realize that winning the big blind in one hand helps maximize earnings, leading to around $25 after facing the boss, compared to $14 if I skip the big blind. That’s a significant difference! Although skipping provides a free uncommon joker, it might not outweigh the financial rewards and the shop access I’d get from playing big. Plus, I could use my funds to buy better cards or jokers. Overall, it seems the best choice is to play the big blind to ensure long-term value!\n**Finalizing game actions**\n\nI’ve figured out that the Blue Joker adds chips before multiplying my total, but since these effects are independent, the scoring formula will calculate final chips as base chips plus additions from scoring and jokers. Since Blue increases chips and Shoot increases the multiplier, I don’t need to rearrange them. Now, it's time to play the big blind. I just need to format my action in JSON for the play_round action, with positions and intended_hand_type set to null. Let's get this done!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
