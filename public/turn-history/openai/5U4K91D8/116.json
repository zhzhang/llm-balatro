{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a card purchase**\n\nI’ve got a limit of 5 slots and currently hold 4, so I can buy without needing to sell. The best option is to buy the Drunkard card at position 1. I’m wondering if I should consider rerolling for better options; it would cost $10, and there’s no guarantee. But the Drunkard card seems solid, and the reroll cost is high. So, I think it’s best to just buy the Drunkard now.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
