{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop purchases**\n\nI'm at Ante 7 and have $21 to spend. There's a Strength tarot for $3, and a Walkie Talkie joker that seems free due to a previous tag. The Walkie Talkie, with scores of 10 or 4, grants +10 chips and adds a x1.5 multiplier, which is beneficial. However, I’m at max capacity for jokers and need to sell one to make space. I'm considering which joker to sell; Drunkard or Ice Cream.\n**Evaluating joker options**\n\nThe Blue Joker currently gives me +104 per remaining card, which is impressive! The Shoot the Moon joker adds a +13 multiplier for each Queen, and Card Sharp multiplies by x3 if I repeat a hand type in a round. I’m considering dropping the Drunkard to get the Walkie Talkie, which could trigger off 10s or 4s in my deck. Even if I don’t have those cards, the Walkie Talkie provides a solid x1.5 multiplier for all hands. I should also think about how the Card Sharp triggers independently.\n**Analyzing joker independence**\n\nI think the Card Sharp can trigger independently. The Shoot the Moon joker fits into the held category, while both the Blue Joker and Ice Cream are independent. The Walkie Talkie seems to have scoring effects for played 10s or 4s and adds a x1.5 multiplier from the polychrome edition. Since I'm at Ante 7 of 8, I should focus on high multipliers. While keeping the Drunkard helps with discards, it’s not essential. Ice Cream could also be a candidate for replacement since its value decreases with each hand played.\n**Assessing joker strengths**\n\nThe Shoot the Moon joker is powerful if I hold enough Queens. I know I have at least 2 Queens (spades and hearts) in my deck, and there might be a diamond Queen as well, though debuffed sometimes. I'm thinking that even if a Queen is debuffed, it should still count for Shoot the Moon since it’s based on being \"held in hand.\" The Card Sharp could give me a x3 multiplier on repeated hands, which is also strong. The Blue Joker benefits from many remaining cards—104 suggests I have 52 cards in the deck, implying it was replenished.\n**Planning shop actions**\n\nIt seems like I might still have a full deck of 52, which makes the Blue Joker quite strong. The Drunkard is probably the weakest option now. I noticed that the Telescope could ensure each celestial pack includes a Pair planet, which would help level up my Pair further, especially since it’s the most played hand. Buying the Telescope for $10 seems smart, given I have $21 available.  \n\nTo execute properly, I should first sell the Drunkard and then buy the Walkie Talkie. I think I’ll replace the Drunkard instead of Ice Cream since the extra discard can be helpful in tight situations. Let’s go ahead and sell the Drunkard next!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
