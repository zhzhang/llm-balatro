{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI need to decide on an action in the blind selection: play or skip. The builds have some strong options, like Blue Joker offering +104 chips. If I skip the small blind, I get a Holographic Tag, but I would miss out on $3 from playing. There's also a Buffoon tag available if I skip the big blind, which leads to a free Mega Buffoon pack. However, if I skip both, I go straight to the boss with no shop options. It's a tricky balance!\n**Evaluating tag impacts and boss challenges**\n\nI'm considering the impact of tags, specifically the holographic one that gives a free joker in the next shop after the boss. If I skip the small blind, I gain the tag immediately, but skipping both small and big means no shop until after the boss, which could be beneficial but risky. The boss's effect says that all face cards are drawn face down, making it tough to strategize. I could still focus on non-face cards and hope for lucky draws, though!\n**Deciding on playing strategy**\n\nThe boss is challenging, so getting a shop before facing it could improve my deck significantly. If I play both the small and big blinds, I'll have shops in between the rounds. Playing small gives $3 and a chance to shop, while playing big offers $4 and also a shop. Skipping those chances doesn’t seem beneficial, especially since my funds are low. I think playing the small blind is the way to go. My choice is to play the round!\n**Planning hand strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to aim for a two pair or a flush, and since my hand levels show the highest two pair at Level 3, that seems like a solid target. I’m estimating my chips could be around 3,000 to 5,000. It’s not strictly necessary to provide this information, but it could help with planning. I'll respond in JSON format to keep everything organized and clear!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
