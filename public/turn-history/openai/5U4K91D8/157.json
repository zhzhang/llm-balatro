{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nOkay, it seems I need to pay $3 to buy and use the Hermit, which doubles my current money. I’m realizing there’s some ambiguity here. After buying it with $9, I’d go down to $6 and double that to $12, which isn’t as beneficial as it could be. \n\nInstead, I could think about buying a Jumbo Celestial pack for $6 to upgrade my best hand. This pack should provide me with Mercury, which could enhance my playing strategy significantly.\n**Considering upgrades and strategies**\n\nUpgrading to Mercury would enhance my Pair from level 4 to 5, increasing my chips and multipliers, but my current strategy focuses on flushes that work with card sharp synergy and a queen multiplier. It might be more beneficial to boost my flush strategy. If we want to go for a flush planet, I could increase flush plays to make that the most played. \n\nAlso, an Arcana pack could improve my deck with cards like Death or Strength. However, I think buying the Jumbo Celestial pack for $6 first, followed by the Hermit, might be a better route, though I'm unsure about the double effect.\n**Evaluating purchase strategies**\n\nIf I buy a pack leaving me with $3, then get the Hermit, I'd end up with $0, which isn't a good plan. Instead, if I use the Hermit first with buy_and_use, I'd have $6 initially, then double it to $12. I could then buy Fibonacci for $8, leaving $4, which would allow me to purchase an Arcana pack exactly. \n\nI need to prioritize using the Hermit first to maximize my funds and then decide between Fibonacci and Arcana. That way, I can get the most value from my money.\n**Considering timing of Hermit use**\n\nI’m weighing whether it’s better to wait versus using the Hermit. It maxes out money at 20, but if I can win rounds and potentially build up to 15 first, then it could be useful. Though, who knows if the Hermit will show up later? I also have that seed money voucher which enhances my cap, but right now interest is low. \n\nScaling up to beat ante boss levels is essential, so using the Hermit now for an extra purchase (like Arcana) could really help. The Arcana pack may give me immediate tarot selections, which could improve my deck and increase my multipliers with more queens in hand. Keeping those queens unplayed could be key!\n**Evaluating strategy and purchases**\n\nIt’s clear that adding more queens to my deck increases the chances of having them in hand during play. Cards like Death would help duplicate them, while Strength boosts ranks to queens. The Arcana pack could provide valuable card selection, but I’m unsure if it’s worth it over Fibonacci. Using the Hermit first makes sense to bring my total to $12, allowing me to buy Fibonacci and potentially the Arcana pack afterward, but I need to consider keeping some funds for interest. I think my best immediate strategy is to buy and use the Hermit first!\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
