{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategy**\n\nI'm in a shop with only $2, and I don’t have cards to buy anything significant. I could sell a joker for $2 to afford a standard pack, which costs $4. I have five jokers, so I need to think about which one is least useful. The Showman might not be crucial early on, but it could help with duplicates later. However, selling it could enable me to buy that standard pack, possibly adding a queen or spade synergy.\n**Weighing card options**\n\nI see that adding a playing card increases my deck size, which boosts the Blue Joker's chips per hand. That's nice, but it slightly decreases my chance of getting a queen. A standard pack offers the possibility of three cards and might include special editions. However, since I've just beaten the big blind and am heading to the boss, I want maximum strength. Selling the Showman would mean losing potential duplicates, but with low money and no consumables, I’m leaning toward retaining it for long-term strategy. Keeping the Showman might be better overall.\n**Evaluating deck strategy**\n\nIf I can’t purchase anything, the extra $2 doesn't do much for me. The boss for this round has effects, which I need to remember. With the ante’s latest rounds, my focus should be on improving my deck. I can rearrange jokers for optimal activation. Blue Joker seems independent, boosting chips based on the remaining cards. Meanwhile, the Showman affects the shop, and the Business Card plays into scores. Figuring out this order is crucial for maximizing my chances against the boss.\n**Analyzing joker effects**\n\nI see that the Wrathful joker triggers bonuses for scored spade cards, adding multipliers. Since jokers trigger effects in left-to-right order, we should likely position Wrathful first, followed by the Business joker. Since they apply to scoring on the same cards, the order of their impact shouldn’t affect the total score. For the Shoot the Moon joker held in hand, it might make sense to keep it first in play. I'm debating whether to sell the Showman for a pack, but it could hurt my long-term strategy—so I need to evaluate the expected value of that decision.\n**Deciding my next action**\n\nI have $2, but I can’t earn interest without at least $5. Keeping the Showman might help me earn from the Business card in future rounds. Selling the Showman to buy a pack means I wouldn't have any money left after the purchase, which won’t assist with interest. The pack could add chips to the Blue Joker and might yield powerful enhanced cards, though selling the Showman reduces my chance for duplicates.\n\nI’m considering that keeping Showman could be beneficial overall. The next action is to proceed to the round select while assessing my jokers and their order for potential future benefits.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
