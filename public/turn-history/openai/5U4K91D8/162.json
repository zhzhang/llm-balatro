{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nHolding onto queens is more challenging now, especially with random discards. I’m wondering if I should sell Shoot the Moon if it becomes unreliable, but it still seems beneficial. For this boss, I might lose the queen at the end because of those discards. It appears boss effects activate before scoring, which could lead to losing the queen even if it remains in hand. I’m unsure if it’s worth selling or buying something, especially with no shop available.\n**Considering game strategy**\n\nI’m contemplating whether I should sell to increase my interest, but the money earned at the end is just $2 from selling Shoot the Moon, which isn’t significant. It might be better to keep it. I’m also thinking about rearranging jokers to trigger earlier, like with Shoot the Moon, but it seems that's not possible. So, my next action has to be play_round, and I need to prepare an output JSON for that without including positions or other details.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
