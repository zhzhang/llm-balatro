{"reasoning":"**Considering gameplay strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the best strategy here—if we play small, we can shop and maybe pick up a tarot or planet, but we only have $1 now. Playing small could give us $3, which we need. It seems like using Seed Money isn't possible since we have no money. I feel sticking to a small play is the best option. Plus, if we skip small, we miss out on shop rewards. Order matters for scoring and triggers, especially for Card Sharp. I have to keep track of that!\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI've got a few components here: Shoot the Moon is held with a multiplier, and then we have Blue Joker and Ice Cream with chips. The Walkie Talkie has a scoring feature that triggers left-to-right, which is key for multiple jokers. Scoring 10s and 4s seems to stack nicely with chips and multipliers. I note that the polychrome edition adds its own multiplier as well, which is independent. I need to ensure we organize the additive bonuses before applying the multiplicative ones effectively!\n**Determining optimal scoring order**\n\nI’m thinking about the order of independent jokers and how it affects multipliers. To maximize our scoring, I’d want to apply the additive multipliers before the multiplicative ones. Shoot the Moon is held and doesn't depend on order, but its trigger matters. Blue Joker and Ice Cream provide chips without order issues. I need Card Sharp and the Walkie Talkie at the end. So, my order should likely be: Blue Joker, Ice Cream, Shoot the Moon, Walkie Talkie, and finally Card Sharp!\n**Evaluating scoring order and actions**\n\nDuring the scoring stage, the Walkie Talkie triggers on scored cards, but its order compared to others is clear—I don't have to worry about that. In the independent stage, I see Blue Joker and Ice Cream add chips, followed by the Walkie Talkie and Card Sharp. Rearranging the order doesn’t seem necessary since the multipliers will always total the same.\n\nI need to proceed with the play_round. Selecting a hand will come later since entering the round shows my hand. So, I'll prepare to output the action in JSON format!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
