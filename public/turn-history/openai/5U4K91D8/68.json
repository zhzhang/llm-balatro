{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategies**\n\nWith the current setup, pairing scoring with Card Sharp x3 looks promising. But if the boss has effects like \"No repeat hand\" or debuffs on hands, I need to be flexible. Maybe getting a Jumbo Celestial pack could help for new cards like Pluto? Each planet corresponds to specific hands: for example, Mercury is a pair and Uranus is two pair. Since leveling pairs is crucial, I might opt for Mercury to strengthen my pairs, especially against a boss that debuffs.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nThe standard pack adds a playing card, which could be useful, like a Queen of Spades, but I'm uncertain. Flash Card needs rerolls to scale, and I can reroll at the shop for $5 each, though I can't reroll against bosses. I could potentially find a better joker or tarot, especially since we have the Tarot Merchant. With $18 available, spending on rerolls seems reasonable. However, we're at max jokers, so I should consider replacing weaker ones like Even Steven or Wrathful. The Blue Joker is giving me +104 chips now, but that’ll drop as my deck shrinks, which I want to manage!\n**Analyzing card values**\n\nCurrently, I have 42 cards left, but the Blue Joker uses the remaining cards in the deck during playtime. At the start of the round, the deck is full at 52 cards. I draw 8 cards, which leaves me with 44 cards, giving the Blue Joker a boost of +88 chips at the start. That's fantastic because while the chips aren't multiplied, multipliers from other cards can still enhance the value significantly. For example, Wrathful contributes +3 for spades scored, while Even Steven offers +4 for even ranks. In pair strategies, though, the multipliers are less valuable.\n**Exploring card swap strategies**\n\nI'm considering swapping one card for Flash Card to gain a constant multiplier. The Flash Card requires rerolls to build up its effect, maybe I can reroll three times for $5 each, resulting in +6 multiplier since I gain +2 per reroll. While this is additive rather than a direct multiplier, it still works independently. With Card Sharp x3, I need to think about how that interacts; Card Sharp applies a x3 multiplier to all multipliers. If I do Flash Card later, it could boost my total multiplier after the bonus from the Card Sharp.\n**Evaluating card strategies for the boss**\n\nIf I place Flash Card before Card Sharp, its +mult would apply before Card Sharp's x3, which is beneficial. A constant +mult is strong, especially with my existing high multipliers. I'm thinking about investing in a Jumbo Celestial pack for Mercury to level up pairs or even consider a Standard pack to add a card that increases my Blue Joker's chips. Although, there's the risk of deck bloat, I might also want to reroll for tarot cards to help with suit conversions. Keeping my queens in hand for Shoot the Moon is also important. Given my current money situation and the importance of earning interest, I need to balance spending wisely while preparing for the boss fight.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nWith Card Sharp x3, the base multiplier is crucial, so I think the best move is to buy the Jumbo Celestial pack and aim for Mercury if it's available. After purchasing, I’ll have to choose from up to 5 cards, and I should execute the command to buy_booster 2. Spending $6 will lower my interest slightly, but the immediate upgrade is worth it. I considered rerolling, but that seems less efficient without a free joker slot. Instead, I'll go for the booster, which doesn’t take up inventory space.
