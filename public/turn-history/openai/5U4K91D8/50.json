{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI need to decide whether to play or skip the big blind. If I skip, I can get the Buffoon Tag, which offers a free Mega Buffoon pack later. This pack gives jokers but skipping means missing the $4 reward and not accessing the shop before facing the boss. If I play and win the big blind, I could visit the shop, which might provide useful items. So, I have to weigh the potential benefits and the risks of skipping.\n**Considering boss impact**\n\nThe boss's rule means \"All face cards are drawn face down,\" which complicates visibility and might debuff strategies. Since I can't see which face cards I hold, it makes it challenging to hold queens for Shoot the Moon or trigger business cards, as I won’t know which cards are which. This reduces the advantage of face-specific jokers. I need to decide whether to play the big blind or skip for the free Mega Buffoon. Selling cards might be an option, but I can’t shop in blind select.\n**Assessing Mega Buffoon strategy**\n\nThe Mega Buffoon pack offers jokers, which could be beneficial, but skipping it means losing out on the shop and $4, plus facing the boss with face-down cards without upgrades. Looking at my scoring, I used to have 3082 with a two pair at the ante 3 small blind threshold, which should be enough since the big blind is 3000, but the boss requires 4000. I might need a better hand to succeed, especially since losing the Shoot the Moon advantage could affect my multiplier. I’ll have to strategize with my remaining cards.\n**Deciding on shop strategy**\n\nHaving a shop before facing the boss could help me buy something useful, but I currently only have $3. If I play the big blind, I might earn a $4 reward plus any leftover hands, potentially getting up to $8-10 for a purchase. However, I won't know the shop contents beforehand. If I skip the big blind, I get a Buffoon Tag, allowing a free Mega Buffoon pack after beating the boss. So, I need to weigh the benefits of immediate purchases versus the tag's long-term advantage.\n**Analyzing choices after the boss**\n\nAfter defeating the boss, I can advance to the next ante and visit the shop. If I play the big blind, I get two shops (before and after the boss) and a chance to earn extra money. On the other hand, skipping gives me a free Mega Buffoon pack, which is valuable but comes with fewer immediate options.\n\nCalculating the expected value is tricky. Playing big blind could provide more money and items, while skipping means fewer rewards upfront but a potential to upgrade later. Overall, I think playing the big blind is the safer choice.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
