{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot strategies**\n\nI'm choosing from five immediate-use tarots and it's important to select the best option. My build includes the Blue Joker scaling with deck size and the Shoot the Moon, which holds queens. The strategy suggests playing pairs with the queens. It seems the most reliable move would be to use Even Steven to achieve a +8 multiplier while holding the queens for extra benefits. However, I need to factor in that Flower Pot requires all suits, which may be tricky with pairs.\n**Clarifying poker hand rules**\n\nI’m trying to understand how Balatro defines a \"poker hand.\" It seems like it refers to the composition of played cards rather than just the scoring hand. Typically, you need to play at least 4 cards to trigger scoring—but if I have a 5-card hand with a pair as the best hand, I can include all suits. Non-participating cards don't score chips, but might still meet Joker conditions. However, the rules emphasize that non-participating cards don’t trigger effects for themselves or others. It's a bit complex!\n**Analyzing Flower Pot effects**\n\nI’m exploring how Flower Pot functions as an independent joker. It triggers after scoring and considers the played cards, not just those scored. If I play five cards where my best hand is a Pair, it should meet the condition for suits. I want to ensure at least one card of each suit is played. Since my current hand has all suits and three queens, I'm thinking it fits well with the strategy. During the shop phase, I have options, like enhancing two selected cards to Bonus cards for extra chips, potentially even my queens.\n**Evaluating options and strategies**\n\nI’m considering how a pair of even ranks could leverage Even Steven, like using pairs of 8s or 10s. Adding a Bonus card gives extra chips, which is helpful since the Blue Joker already adds +86 chips. The Hermit has potential to double my current money, capped at $20. Since I have $27, this would bring my total to $47. With The Soul creating a Joker, I need to ensure I have room for it, so I might need to sell one first.\n**Evaluating tarot options and strategies**\n\nI'm weighing whether to sell a joker to make room for The Soul, which creates a random joker. Selling Even Steven could be one option. The Hermit doubles my money but only up to $20, so from $27, I'd gain $47. Justice offers a strong multiplier, and Glass could enhance a queen or an 8, but there's a risk of destruction. However, applying it to an 8 could ramp up my multipliers nicely. Given all factors, I'll choose the Hermit for immediate value and safety.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
