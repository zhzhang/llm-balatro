{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop with only $3. I can't afford the bull or mega standard prizes—too expensive! The only actions I have are to select or rearrange jokers or to sell something for a bit more cash. Selling a joker or two could help, but I'm still unsure. Should I go for a reroll or save my jokers for future use? Rerolling might yield a better joker, but I'd risk being left with no money. Okay, it's definitely a tough decision!\n**Assessing joker strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to sell a joker for a reroll, but I should evaluate my current jokers first. The Blue Joker is valuable early game, and others like Shoot the Moon and Wrathful have benefits too. The business card is great for money but doesn't help my scoring, especially as I mostly play Two Pair, which relies on consistent multipliers. Since my current funds are only $3, I can’t buy anything, so maybe it’s best to move to the next round and earn some cash instead.\n**Deciding on round actions**\n\nI need to consider that we’re currently in Ante 3, Round 7 in Balatro, which means round increments are likely connected to each blind. We just beat the small blind, and the big blind will follow. Since our Two Pair has leveled up to 4, my best move now seems to be selecting a round action rather than rearranging jokers. The order of jokers does matter for triggers, but I'm thinking I should keep them as is because it doesn’t affect multipliers. I’ll go ahead with a round_select action.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
