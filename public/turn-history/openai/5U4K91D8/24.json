{"reasoning":"**Considering options in the shop**\n\nI'm in a shop with $7 to spend. I see options like Judgement Tarot for $3 and Crazy Joker for $4. The boosters are too expensive, and the blank voucher is $10. Rerolling costs $5, and I currently have 2 jokers and room for 5 cards. My build is focusing on scaling with the Blue Joker and maximizing multipliers from Queens. While Crazy Joker could work, I’m leaning towards buying Judgement for its potential benefit. I can buy both for exactly $7, but I’m unsure about Crazy.\n**Determining best purchase strategy**\n\nI think it's better to buy Judgement first to see what joker it creates, making sure I have enough room for it. Judgement is a tarot consumable; since it's a card in the shop, I can buy it and use it immediately without needing any targets. It seems like it makes sense to use the buy_and_use_consumable command. However, I need to confirm the consumable position within the cards section for it to work properly.\n**Deciding on card purchase and strategy**\n\nJudgement is in the first position in the shop, so I’ll use buy_and_use_consumable 1 to get a random joker. After using Judgement, the new joker will add to my inventory, and then I can consider whether to buy Crazy Joker, but I can only take one action now. Looking at the bankroll, we’re facing a big blind of 1200 next, and winning could give us a $4 reward. Crazy Joker is cheap and can be sold later, but it might clutter my joker slots. It gives a +12 multiplier for a straight, which doesn’t fit my current two-pair strategy, but I could use it if I manage to make a straight later on.\n**Finalizing the decision on actions**\n\nI realize I’m relying on holding queens for my strategy, and a straight uses 5 cards, which may not include queens. While I can still hold onto a queen if I don’t play, building a straight often means discarding cards, which could complicate things. However, Judgement could give me beneficial synergies, like with Baron or Mime. Random outcomes can be a risk, but I can always sell them if needed. So, I’ll take Judgement first and prepare to output the action in JSON format.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
