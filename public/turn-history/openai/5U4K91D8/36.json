{"reasoning":"**Evaluating deck and card options**\n\nI'm considering how the deck works. Initially, I had 31 cards left, but it seems the deck resets to 52 cards with each new ante. So, I should have a total of 52 cards in the deck. Adding a card would increase the count to 53. I have a lot of jokers, so I could sell either the Showman or Business Card. The Showman increases shop odds, while the Business Card might generate money from face cards. I'm thinking about buying the Jupiter planet card.\n**Considering card purchase strategy**\n\nI can buy and use the Jupiter card immediately, as it's a consumable type in the Shop Cards. The command I need is buy_and_use_consumable. I'm wondering if I should also buy Neptune since both cards total just $6. However, I want to save money for future interest, which could affect my funds after this round. Since having at least $5 yields interest, maybe buying Jupiter for $3 while keeping $6 for interest is the best move.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m weighing my options: if I buy the Arcana pack for $4, I'll have $2 left with no interest, which isn't good. Buying Neptune would leave me with $3, also no interest. It seems that buying only Jupiter is the best option. The reroll cost of $5 isn't worth it, and I can't afford the $10 Voucher Director's Cut. So, I'll proceed with the buy_and_use_consumable action for Jupiter, confirming its position in the shop. I’ll set the positions array to [2].\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
