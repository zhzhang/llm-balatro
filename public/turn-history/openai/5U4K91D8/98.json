{"reasoning":"I'm analyzing my current strategy in the shop. I've got $47 and the only shop card available is the Runner joker, which costs $5. With five jokers maxed out, the Runner gives me bonuses whenever I play a hand containing a straight. I previously focused on pairs, but since I recently leveled my straight, I might pivot my strategy to incorporate straights more frequently. Flower Pot and even Steven also support this, so it could work out!\nI'm considering my options with my big hand size. I can hold onto the queens while still forming straights with other cards. Using Card Sharp could give me a big boost if I play multiple straights this round, which seems doable. But I need to decide if I should sell one of my jokers to afford the Runner. The Blue Joker offers a solid +104 chips, while Shoot the Moon is valuable with the queens. I’ll weigh these strengths carefully!\nI’m considering how to satisfy the condition of playing five cards with all suits while keeping in mind that the \"poker hand contains...\" requirement likely pertains to the actual scoring hand. This makes me think that I need to include five cards in play, which is tricky if I'm only using pairs since that limits me to two cards. If Flower Pot depends on having four different suits, then it won't work with pairs. Still, I’ve been scoring well, so maybe I should focus on Card Sharp instead!\nI’m wondering if Flower Pot isn’t triggering since my scores aren't getting bigger, which is a bit puzzling. I need to decide my next move; I could reroll the shop for a better joker or tarot card, but that costs $5. With $47 funds and a cap of $50 for seed money, I need to be cautious. Entering the next round might require more power, and while the Runner offers scaling chips for straights, the Blue Joker already gives me chips. I should consider how they can work together!\nI’m weighing my options with jokers and considering how they impact scoring. The Runner could be a solid addition because it grows chips, but it starts from zero compared to the Blue Joker's steady output. I might keep Even Steven for its multipliers with Card Sharp and Flower Pot, but if Flower Pot isn't triggering, it may be better to sell it instead. I have to evaluate if I should reroll and see if I can find better jokers or focus on buying Runner. Selling Flower Pot and then getting Runner seems like my best move!\nI’ve decided to go ahead and sell first. This makes sense because it’s a crucial part of my plan before making any other moves. By selling, I can clear space for the Runner card that I want to buy. I’ll ensure that everything is in order and ready for that transition. This seems like the most efficient step to take right now, so I’m feeling good about it!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
