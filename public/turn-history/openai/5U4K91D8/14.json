{"reasoning":"**Calculating Two Pair Strategy**\n\nI’m working on our Two Pair strategy with discards. Since we’re already at level 2 after two plays, moving further seems wise for scoring. Let’s break it down: current base chips for Two Pair at level 2 equals 40, with a multiplier of 3. After Uranus, they'll become 60 chips with a multiplier of 4. With the Blue Joker adding 104, we have enough potential to reach our target of 600, even if some cards are debuffed. So, I’ll select pack position 5.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
