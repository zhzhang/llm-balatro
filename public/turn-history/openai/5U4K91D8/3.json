{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip values**\n\nI'm adding up chip values for the participating cards—Q10, J10, and getting a total of 60 chips. When I multiply by 2, it gets me to 120. We need a total of 300, so with three hands at 120, that brings us to 360. I still have 4 hands left. I think I could aim for a full house or four of a kind, but I only have 2 discards left. If I draw another rank from my pairs, I could make a full house!\n**Evaluating discard strategy**\n\nIf I discard those two cards and draw two new ones, the chance of getting at least one of my 5 outs is 1 - C(30,2)/C(35,2), which calculates to about 26.9%. That’s not great. I can discard up to 5 cards but want to keep my pairs. I might consider dropping the 6s and 5d or breaking a pair to increase my chances. For the small blind, I can play two pairs now for 120, and then see if I can improve with the remaining hands. But playing earlier won’t limit my discards; I’ll simply replace the played cards.\n**Considering hand strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about whether to play a 5-card full house, but that might not work. Instead, I could use low cards and 7s to preserve my Qs and Js for higher chips. If I play two pairs, specifically with 7s, I remember I only have one pair—just two 7s to work with. Playing a pair of queens yields only 60 chips, while two pairs with Q and J gives me 120. Oh, in Balatro, I can keep unplayed cards for future hands! So I could play two pairs like Q and J, and a 6 as my fifth card.\n**Deciding on card selection**\n\nThe 6 doesn’t really participate, so if I play it, it won’t score and will just be removed. It makes more sense to play just the four cards. I can use Qc, Qd, Js, and Jh, which still counts as two pairs, and keep 7h, 7d, 6s, and 5d for my next hand. Alternatively, I could play five cards with a kicker of 7, but the 7 would end up staying in hand. After scoring 120, I’ll need 180 chips, and for the next hand, I'll draw four new cards to replace the played ones. So I’m planning to play positions 1, 3, 5, and 6 from my hand for the two pairs, estimating chips at 120.\n**Computing chip values**\n\nAlright, let’s break this down: I start with base chips of 20 plus 40 from the participating cards (10 each from four cards), totaling 60. Multiplying that by 2 gives me 120. Now I need to provide this information in a JSON format for action. The action will be \"play,\" the positions will be [1, 3, 5, 6], and the intended hand type is \"two pair,\" with the estimated chips being 120.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6]"}
