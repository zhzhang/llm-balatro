{"reasoning":"**Clarifying stone cards' role**\n\nI’m figuring out the role of stone cards in gameplay. They lack rank or suit and don't contribute to the hand type, but they can add chips when used, although only if they’re part of a scoring hand. However, if stone cards aren't considered for scoring, they might just represent a high card instead. Ultimately, it seems they always score in Balatro, as they provide \"+50 Chips\" even if they’re not part of the hand.\n**Understanding scoring with stone cards**\n\nI’m considering if stone cards always score since they’re counted as \"played cards\" even if not in the hand. The rules state only cards in the highest hand contribute chips and trigger effects. Since stone cards lack rank or suit, they wouldn’t contribute to the hand type, which makes things tricky. Yet in Balatro, they score when played, earning 50 chips. So, it appears they score as played cards without affecting hand type.\n**Examining stone card scoring**\n\nIn Balatro, it seems any played card not in the hand type isn’t scored, which presents a challenge for stone cards since they can’t contribute to the hand type. I have this memory that stone cards do score, functioning as chip boosters. Maybe they have an exception and score regardless, but the prompt suggests special effects might override rules. I think stone cards might always participate, but I’m not entirely sure. Given the uncertainty, I’ll opt for the wheel upgrade instead.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
