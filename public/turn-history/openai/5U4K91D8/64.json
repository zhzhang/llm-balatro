{"reasoning":"**Analyzing poker strategy**\n\nIf we skip the big bet, we'd double our money from $13 to $26, which sounds great, but we would miss the shop until after the boss. Since we can’t skip the boss, we need to approach him with the same setup. I wonder if our current jokers could handle him? He diminishes the level of the played poker hand, making things trickier, but if we play strong hands like a flush, we could reach that 10,000 threshold.\n**Evaluating poker strategy against the boss**\n\nThe boss lowers the level of our played poker hand each time we use it. If I want to take advantage of Card Sharp, playing the same hand twice will reduce its level twice. The first play doesn’t benefit from Card Sharp, but the second can multiply by three, even if it's at a lower level. It might be better to use different hand types to avoid penalties, but Card Sharp could still help us hit threshold targets. Getting upgrades in the shop before facing the boss seems like a smart move. However, if we skip the big bet, we could end up with more money to spend after the boss fight if we survive!\n**Assessing survival chances against the boss**\n\nIt's tough to know if we can survive the boss without visiting the shop first. I think we can manage, but it's risky! Let's analyze our scoring potential. The Blue Joker adds +104 chips based on the remaining cards in the deck, which has 52 cards, so it gives me +104 chips for each hand. Shoot the Moon offers a +13 multiplier for each queen I hold, and I already have the Queen of Spades. I can stack multipliers with spades and even ranks, plus keeping a queen for that boost. I recently converted some cards to spades, increasing those chances!\n**Calculating poker hand potential**\n\nFor the big blind, I need 7,500 chips, which seems manageable. Facing the boss, I aim for 10,000, and despite level decreases, I think I can still pull off a flush with some multipliers and Card Sharp. If I play a flush with five spades, for instance, 10♠, 6♠, 4♠, 2♠, and 8♠, I trigger multipliers for the even ranks, totaling a +35 multiplier. \n\nWith base chips adding up, the flush gives me 80 chips originally, plus an additional +104 from the Blue Joker. After all this, if I hold a queen as well, I could jump to 54 with even more, but I also need to think about how Card Sharp tripling my multipliers might fit in.\n**Deciding strategy for the boss encounter**\n\nSo, the second flush with multipliers could yield a total of 162, bringing my chips to 29808, which is well above 10,000. Even without Card Sharp, I'm close at 9936, so I might need to either optimize my chips or Card Sharp. The boss decreases the flush level after I play it, meaning I should plan a strong flush for my strategy. I could use high even cards, like a spade flush with Q♠, J♠, and others to maximize my multipliers. \n\nUltimately, I think playing big blind first seems smarter as it lets me shop beforehand and still gives me a chance to grow my money, balancing risk and potential rewards for the boss fight. Playing big blind also keeps my financials intact. Given all this, I believe I should proceed with \"play_round\" as my action!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
