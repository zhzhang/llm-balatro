{"reasoning":"**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI'm at blind select with a small blind of 5000 and a reward of $3. There's an option to skip for a Handy Tag worth $13. This Handy Tag gives $1 per played hand this run. I wonder if that money is immediate? In Balatro, tags seem to be redeemed later in the shop, yet it sounds like skipping grants an immediate benefit. Skipping gives a significant reward compared to the small blind. I'll have to weigh the choice of playing versus skipping carefully!\n**Evaluating skip vs. play options**\n\nI'm considering the implications of skipping the small blind. If I choose to skip, I won't be able to shop between small and big blinds, as shopping happens after beating the blind. Skipping does advance to the next blind, but I miss the $3 reward. I wonder if I still benefit from the tag, gaining some immediate cash while progressing. However, playing gives me a chance for additional earnings from leftover hands and interest, potentially increasing my total to $5-7. It's a tough decision!\n**Weighing skip vs. play choices**\n\nI'm pondering whether to skip or play the small blind. Without a boss effect, skipping might still be better, but it means missing the chance to shop after the small blind. If I play and win, I'd get the chance to shop for items like Saturn. With $0 right now, I could see that playing could boost my funds to $5+, which is significant. Skipping delays my access to the shop until after the big blind or boss, so I'm really torn about missing out on these opportunities. Should I be worried?\n**Assessing the boss effect and options**\n\nI’m considering the boss effect, which decreases the level of a poker hand every time I play it. If I play a hand, its level drops, making future plays weaker. My main hand, Two Pair level 4, would be impacted negatively. Accessing the shop before the boss to add jokers or planets is valuable. I could play small first to shop for improvements, or I could skip for $13, potentially delaying my shop visit after the big blind. Skipping might reduce risk, so $13 now could help make important purchases later!\n**Choosing between skip and play**\n\nI’m looking at the economy tag that doubles money up to $40. If I skip the small blind and get $13, I could skip the big and receive the economy tag. But skipping the big means no shop access until after the boss, which is risky. I can likely manage with my current deck, but it might weaken my hands due to level decreases. Playing small first could get me $3 plus additional hands, which allows for shopping later. \n\nOverall, skipping small seems like the best choice for immediate funds!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
