{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy in Ante 6**\n\nI'm starting with $51, which is good! I need to strengthen my scaling for the upcoming antes. The Blue Joker gives me +2 chips for each remaining card in the deck, leading to +104 chips, suggesting there are about 52 cards left. My core multiplier seems to be from Shoot the Moon and Card Sharp on repeat hand types. My current strategy focuses on playing pairs to keep queens in hand, but as antes rise, I might need additional multipliers or scaling chips. I see some options in the shop, like Flower Pot for suit variety.\n**Assessing pack options**\n\nI’m considering the arcana and celestial packs while we have full jokers (5/5). To buy either Flower Pot or Runner, I’d need to sell a joker, but which one is less valuable? The Blue Joker adds +104 chips per hand independently, which is significant. Shoot the Moon is essential for large multipliers, while Card Sharp, Even Steven, and Wrathful also contribute to multipliers. Flower Pot gives a x3 multiplier if a hand includes all four suits—a nice option if I can arrange mixed suits while keeping my queens in hand.\n**Clarifying hand rules**\n\nI can play a pair with four suits by selecting five cards, but there’s a requirement that the hand must contain a Diamond, Club, Heart, and Spade. I’m wondering if \"contains\" refers to the scoring cards used or the actual played hand. In Balatro, it seems \"hand contains\" relates to the five selected cards. If some cards don’t contribute to the highest hand, they may not count as \"contained.\" But usually, all played cards matter for joker effects. For Flower Pot, it checks if suits are in the scoring hand, which uses all played cards. The hand type is based on the best five.\n**Understanding pair and kickers**\n\nI’ve realized I can select up to five cards for my poker hand, and the chosen cards determine the hand type. Only two cards matter for a pair, but I’m wondering if high cards or unscored kickers count as \"contained.\" According to the rules, cards not contributing to the highest hand don’t trigger effects, but Flower Pot checks the entire poker hand, potentially including non-scoring kickers. To meet the suit requirement, I can play a pair with two 6s and three other suit cards, even if they're debuffed by a boss, which would allow for a x3 multiplier.\n**Deciding on joker and purchases**\n\nI already have Card Sharp giving me a x3 multiplier, and if I stack that, it gives me a x9 multiplier. I need to consider the impact of debuffed hearts or other bosses. Including a heart should be manageable, even if debuffed. If that's the case, then Flower Pot would be really powerful. To make space for it, I'd likely sell the Wrathful Joker since Even Steven has a higher potential multiplier. After selling Wrathful, I can securely buy the Flower Pot and consequently purchase the Paint Brush to increase my hand size—very valuable! So, I'll command to sell Joker 3.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
