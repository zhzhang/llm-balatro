{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm in a shop with $7. I have some choices: a Bull for $6, a Celestial pack for $4, and I can't afford the Mega Standard pack or voucher. I'm thinking about buying the Celestial pack since it might help with my main hands. If I buy it for $4, I'll have $3 left, but that may reduce my interest since it’s calculated at the end of each round. However, the Celestial planet might be more beneficial than that small interest. I'll consider if I want to buy the Bull too.\n**Evaluating purchases and strategy**\n\nI'm looking at the Bull, which gives +14 chips for my current $7, but it's not impressive compared to the Blue's +104. The Bull scales with money, so keeping my funds high is essential. However, my joker slots are full, and I need to decide what to sell. The Business Card generates money but would occupy a slot. I already have good multi-generation, so I think buying the Celestial pack is the best move now. I'll proceed to buy the booster.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
