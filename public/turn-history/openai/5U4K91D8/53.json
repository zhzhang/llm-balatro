{"reasoning":"**Weighing card options**\n\nI'm considering my card strategy for the game. The Shoot the Moon triggers for queens can be problematic if I accidentally play or discard them. I could try focusing only on numbered cards, but there's a risk since face-down cards are unpredictable. The Director's Cut could help remove annoying debuffs, but it costs 10. Card Sharp offers a strong multiplier if I've played the right hand type, and I think I should buy it first.\n**Exploring card options**\n\nI'm thinking about how to use my remaining $6 after purchasing Card Sharp, and I realize I can't buy a voucher. I could buy a standard pack or Venus to level up three of a kind, but it seems better to save for a reroll, even though I can't reroll the boss. Since my main goal is to win right now, Card Sharp is the best value. I should also consider rearranging the order of my jokers based on their scoring categories.\n**Understanding card mechanics**\n\nI'm thinking through how chip modifications and multipliers work. It seems that the order of adding chips or multipliers doesn't affect the final outcome since independent effects modify chips or multipliers separately. If I add chips first, it won’t matter for the final result. However, if there are any independent additions to the multiplier, that order would matter. Since we don’t have any independent multipliers, I realize I should buy Card Sharp now. After that, I can look at buying a Standard Pack with the remaining $6.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy a standard pack for deck improvement. Adding cards like spades, evens, or queens sounds good, but the booster selection leads to more decisions on what cards to choose. I also need to think about holding onto cash for interest; for every $5, I earn interest at the end of the round. Currently, I have $12, but spending too much could reduce that interest. Keeping $10 would yield $2 interest, which seems beneficial, yet I still need to focus on power scaling with Card Sharp.\n**Deciding on purchases and strategy**\n\nI’m leaning towards buying Director's Cut, but I can't reroll the boss just yet. The voucher allows one reroll at the blind select screen. Director's Cut can enable rerolls later, which is tempting at $10, but I'd still be stuck with the current boss. With the voucher, I could reroll before facing the ante 3 boss, which might help. However, Card Sharp seems more crucial right now, so I should prioritize that. Afterward, I can save money for interest or future purchases.\n**Planning card order**\n\nI’m thinking about the order of my jokers: Wrathful first, then Even Steven, followed by Shoot the Moon, Blue Joker, and finally Card Sharp. It seems wise to keep the held-in-hand jokers earlier, even if it’s not critical. I should buy Card Sharp first, since that's my next action. After that, I can rearrange the jokers as needed. For now, my immediate task is to execute the buy_card action, so I'll go ahead and do that.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
