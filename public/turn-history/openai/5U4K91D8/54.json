{"reasoning":"**Calculating deck and chip values**\n\nAlright, let’s break this down. In the previous round, there were 44 cards remaining in the deck, which means +2 chips per remaining card, totaling 88. After a win, it now shows +104 in the shop—indicating a full deck of 52 cards. Each added card increases the Blue Joker’s value by 2 chips. I'm considering options like buying a Standard Pack to add a card or leveling up the Venus for a potential score boost, but keeping money for interest might be a better strategy.\n**Considering spending and upgrades**\n\nWith $6, I would earn $1 interest if I keep at least $5. If I spend $4, I’d have $2 left—so maybe I shouldn't spend? But upgrades are crucial, especially with the upcoming ante and higher blinds. I’m thinking about buying a Standard Pack to possibly add a spade or queen to help with \"Shoot the Moon.” I also need to think about the arrangement of jokers, especially since the order can matter for scoring and multipliers.\n**Clarifying joker categories**\n\nIt looks like Card Sharp is indeed independent, which is good to confirm. It provides a multiplier of x3 if I’ve already played a poker hand this round. It's positioned among independent jokers, where the order matters for applying multiplicative multipliers. The Blue Joker adds chips, but does not multiply. Shoot the Moon is held in hand, while Wrathful and Even are on scored. Ultimately, the arrangement isn’t critical, but I should keep Card Sharp at the far right for clarity!\n**Deciding on purchases and strategy**\n\nThe Blue Joker adds independent chips, but the order doesn’t really affect those chips. So, I can go ahead and buy a booster, which will let me select a card afterward—though my action schema only allows the purchase for now. I think I’ll choose the first standard pack, leaving me with $2. While that might affect my interest, it feels like a reasonable trade-off. Alternatively, I could buy Venus for $3, but that wouldn’t help my interest either. Saving $5 would get me interest, but improving my deck might be worth it!\n**Strategizing purchases and savings**\n\nWith Card Sharp, I think I may be strong enough to consider saving for the Director's Cut at $10, which could be valuable for rerolls against tough bosses. Saving my $6 now instead of spending could allow me to reach that goal after the boss battle. I also have the option to reroll for a better joker or buy the Venus card, but both may not be necessary now. Ultimately, it looks like the best strategy is to save and prepare for the next round while possibly rearranging jokers for efficiency.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
