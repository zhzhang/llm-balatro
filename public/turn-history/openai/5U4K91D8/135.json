{"reasoning":"**Planning shop strategy**\n\nI’m planning my purchases at the shop before 7 with $23. The options are Strength tarot for $3, boosters for $6 each, and a Telescope voucher for $10. We already have strong jokers, so I need to think ahead for ante 7 and 8. The Telescope ensures a planet in each celestial pack, which might be beneficial since pair scoring seems significant for our gameplay. I'd like to maximize my scoring potential with the pairs I play more often.\n**Evaluating purchase strategy**\n\nI'm considering how the Telescope, along with celestial packs, can quickly boost my pair level. Buying the Telescope costs $10, leaving me with $13, which allows me to buy both celestial packs for $12, leaving just $1. Normally, keeping over $20 would yield $4 interest per round, but spending might be necessary for competitive gameplay at ante 7/8 due to increasing chip requirements. Honestly, acquiring the Telescope and at least one celestial pack seems to be the best option! It helps ensure I have the right planets for maximizing my pairs.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm realizing that leveling my pair increases base chips and multipliers, which gives me a higher total with card sharp boosts. So, I'll definitely purchase the Telescope first, along with at least one celestial pack. Strength tarot is another option that can enhance up to 2 selected cards, though it’s not as crucial right now. Still, it could turn a Jack into a Queen or something useful later. I think I should grab Strength tarot after my main purchases for that extra flexibility!\n**Weighing purchase options**\n\nI'm looking at my spending options and realizing that if I buy the Telescope, two celestial packs, and Strength tarot, I'd go over my budget of $23. I really prefer getting the Telescope with two packs, but it leaves me with just $1—no interest gained. Maybe it’s better to buy the Telescope, one pack, and the Strength tarot instead, which would leave me with $4. However, I wonder about the risk of missing out on current celestial packs. Leveling my pair quickly might help me compete better at ante 7 and beyond.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
