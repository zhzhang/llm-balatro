{"reasoning":"**Playing game round**\n\nI need to play a round since we can't skip the boss select, and it's a blind choice. Right now, I only have the Blue Joker available, with no consumables to help out. It looks like I'll focus on making the most of the Blue Joker. I'll play the round and see how things go from there. It’s just a matter of diving in and giving it my best shot!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
