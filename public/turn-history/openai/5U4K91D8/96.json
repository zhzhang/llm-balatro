{"reasoning":"**Considering shop purchases**\n\nI’m in a shop with $33 and the only item for sale is the Joker for the Runner 5. The Jumbo Arcana Pack costs $6, and I have no consumables. Buying the Arcana seems like a good choice to improve my deck, but I could also reroll for a better Joker or some tarot cards. The order of my jokers—Blue, Shoot, Even, Card Sharp, and Flower Pot—matters for activation. I need to think through their interactions to see how they play together!\n**Deciding on purchases and order**\n\nI’m considering when to use the multiplicative effects later on. Since \"Shoot\" held triggers before the independent cards, that’s good to know. \"Even Steven\" adds multiplicative scoring per card before any x multipliers, so it makes sense to put additive effects before those. Blue doesn't affect multipliers, which is fine. I think I’ll keep Card Sharp and Flower Pot after that. So, I’m set to buy the Arcana pack—let's go ahead and make that purchase!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
