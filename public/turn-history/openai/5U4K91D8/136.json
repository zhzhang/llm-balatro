{"reasoning":"**Evaluating celestial packs and options**\n\nI'm at the shop with $13 and have a Telescope voucher, which guarantees that I get Mercury with each celestial pack since it's part of my most played hands. My most played hands include a Pair at level 2 and Two Pair at level 6. Buying two jumbo celestial packs for $12 would leave me with $1, or I could buy one pack and a Strength card for $3 to boost specific cards in my hand for potential triggers. However, I can't effectively target my boosts without seeing my hand.\n**Planning purchases in the shop**\n\nI’ve realized the shop card is a Strength tarot, which adds to my consumables inventory—currently at zero, but that's okay. I need to secure scoring options with an endgame ante of 7. My plan is to buy at least one celestial pack to level up my Pair by getting Mercury. Each jumbo pack can provide up to 5 planet cards, and choosing Mercury from both packs could raise my Pair's level significantly, which is crucial for boosting my score! However, I must consider my remaining funds.\n**Deciding on purchases with ante**\n\nWe're at ante 7, so money isn't as crucial right now. However, I should think about the Ice Cream, which decreases chips each hand played — selling it might be an option later. For now, I could buy one celestial pack for $6 and a Strength card for $3, leaving me with $4. But since this might be the last shop before final antes, I think I’ll go for both celestial packs. I’ll start by selecting to buy the booster now.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
