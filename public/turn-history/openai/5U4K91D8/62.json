{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game dynamics**\n\nI see that Card Sharp is multiplied by three, while other independent additives are absent. Shoot the Moon is held stage additive, and both Wrathful and Even Steven have on-scored additives. It seems placing the multipliers at the end of the independent stage might be optimal for maximizing the score. However, since our sources for multipliers are in the earlier scoring stage, Card Sharp’s timing is fine. Therefore, I’ll proceed with the action of round_select and return the JSON action.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
