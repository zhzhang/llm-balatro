{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about an optimal play strategy where I could use two cards and keep both queens in hand for a +26 multiplier. However, I need to avoid hearts since they're debuffed, meaning their abilities are disabled. I currently have 9S, 5C, 3C, JD, and two debuffed hearts. While I could create a pair of queens, that would lose the held bonus. But if I play both queens, I might score big — calculating total chips gives me 129.\n**Calculating final multipliers**\n\nI’m working with a base multiplier of 3. The on-scored jokers include the Wrathful for the spade QS, adding +3. But since I’ve played the queens and not held them, the Shoot the Moon isn't applicable, giving me a total multiplier of just 6. Card Sharp’s bonus kicks in after scoring, increasing it to 18. That leads to final chips of 2,322, which is less than before. I should discard to find a pair while keeping both queens to fish for two of a kind.\n**Selecting useful discards**\n\nI need to choose cards to discard that aren't useful, especially since I want to keep my queens. A♥ and K♥ are debuffed and worthless, while 5C and 3C are questionable. I have 9S and JD, which can help with multipliers. To make a pair, I can hold 9S and discard others to look for another 9. There are two 9s left in the deck. Alternatively, I could hold JD and search for another jack. Aiming for pairs of 9s or jacks seems smart, especially with the potential for multipliers.\n**Focusing on potential pairs**\n\nI’m considering aiming for pairs of 10s or 8s, but I don’t have any in hand right now. I could discard five cards to search for an even pair, but it might be simpler to find any pair to activate Card Sharp for a x3 multiplier. Keeping my queens also boosts my multiplier significantly. Reflecting on a previous pair hand, I scored 3,483 with a pair of 8s, which provided a +8 multiplier. So I’ll want to strategize carefully!\n**Strategizing discards and pairs**\n\nI’m considering my current chips, which now total 129. If I follow the same strategy as before, aiming for a pair with Card Sharp’s x3 multiplier could yield around 10,449, especially since I could hold both queens for a +26 boost. \n\nWhen planning my next move, I'm looking at my hand: 1 QS, 2 9S, 3 A♥, 4 K♥, 5 QC, 6 5C, 7 3C, 8 JD. My plan is to discard A♥, K♥, 5C, and 3C to look for new cards while keeping my higher cards, like QS, QC, 9S, and JD. So I’ll go ahead and discard those four cards!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,6,7]"}
