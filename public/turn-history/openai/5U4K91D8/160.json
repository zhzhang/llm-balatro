{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card synergy**\n\nActually, Walkie triggers when I score a 10 or 4, giving a boost of +10 chips and +4 mult. If I enhance a 4 to a Mult Card, it remains a 4 but still triggers Walkie and gets the +4 mult from enhancement. Looking at my hand, I've got a 4 of hearts at pos5, which is a solid candidate. I've also got multiple 2s and 5s, so enhancing a 2 or 5 to a mult card could work well for flush hearts and Fibonacci. It's a tough call, but avoiding playing the queen might be wise in specific scenarios.\n**Considering flush strategy**\n\nWith a flush, I might need to include the queen, but I can actually exclude her to focus on my hand size of 9. I see that I have hearts: Q, J, 5, 4, and 2. That's exactly 5 hearts, but to create a flush, I’d need all five, which means I have to play the queen. Losing the Shoot the Moon bonus might not be ideal, but if flush scoring is strong, it could be worthwhile. I could also use Wild cards to help achieve a flush without needing the queen. So, I could convert another card to Wild and achieve my flush without her.\n**Crafting a strong flush strategy**\n\nI can make a wild card from Jack of spades, allowing me to play J♠ as a heart and create a flush while keeping the queen of hearts for a +13 mult. That sounds promising! The Lovers would enhance one card to Wild, which can help trigger Fibonacci or Walkie, depending on usage. If I choose to make a 2 or 4 wild, I can maintain my flush strategy and still hold the queen. However, the World can convert up to 3 cards to spades, allowing for a spade flush. But that might not help maintain the queen. I could even switch the queen to spades while still counting her as a queen for the Shoot the Moon, which could be a fun twist!\n**Analyzing flush and multiplier strategies**\n\nPlaying a flush with spades might require using the queen if I only have 4 spades. The World lets me target up to 3 cards, potentially increasing the overall spades in the deck for consistency. But suits are flexible in this case. Empress presents a direct mult boost and works well with xmult, particularly useful in late ante. Lovers, on the other hand, is more about strategy for holding the queen and making a flush. Empress boosts +4 mult for each of two cards scored, totaling +8 mult per hand. When I consider Card Sharp and Walkie, I might end up with substantial multipliers, creating a strong play overall.\n**Navigating tarot strategies**\n\nLovers doesn't boost multipliers directly, but it can make a card wild, which might help create flushes while keeping my queen for that +13 mult. However, I already have a good chance of making a flush due to my card selection. While I can enhance cards with Empress, I must choose targets from my current hand of 9 cards. I think I’ll aim to enhance the 4 of hearts and the 2 of hearts, ensuring they remain in the deck for future plays. Choosing Lovers allows me to make a card wild, possibly the 2 of clubs or Jack of spades, which is handy. But it might be better to go for enhancing a 4 to wild since it triggers Walkie and can be versatile in triggering additional strategies!\n**Choosing between card enhancements**\n\nSince I already have 4 of hearts, making it wild might not limit my ability to build a hearts flush—actually, it still can work! However, having a wild card means I can create flushes more flexibly while keeping my queen. Empress would provide a direct +4 mult whenever I score, which stacks with Walkie, making it possibly more advantageous. I’m thinking about choosing to enhance 4 hearts and 2 hearts with Empress for effective scoring. \n\nI could also explore converting hearts to spades with The World, but that may not be necessary for my flush strategy. With my current cards, it seems enhancing specific cards that are likely to be scored, like 2 hearts and 5 hearts, is a solid path to boost multipliers. Enhancing those gives me more chances to score higher with Fibonacci contributions. I’ll go with the 5 hearts as I have multiple options available for a flush!\n**Evaluating card enhancements and strategies**\n\nI’m considering enhancing cards like the 4 hearts and 5 hearts for a flush, which could give me a +8 mult. But for a pair, the 4 hearts' usefulness depends on whether it's part of a pair or a high card, which might not happen. Since flushes seem to yield higher scores more consistently, focusing on them makes sense.\n\nGiven my cards, enhancing two 2s could be a strong strategy for pair and two pair hands. The Fibonacci triggers for each enhanced 2 add significant value. So, I think enhancing the 2 hearts and 2 clubs would support my scoring well, allowing combinations with both cards in play. Plus, I gain multipliers from Walkie Talkie and Card Sharp to maximize my outcomes!\n**Calculating scoring potential with enhancements**\n\nI’m analyzing how to maximize my scoring. If Card Sharp is active from a previous pair, I could get a nice total of 27,405 chips! Without that, I might still get 9,135, which is pretty good. However, for a flush, my base could be higher with a base of 65 and an 8x multiplier, plus bonuses from card chips and the Blue Joker.\n\nEnhancing the 2 hearts and 2 clubs seems strategic since pairs and two pairs are my most frequently played hands. I'll use Empress to target these cards, aiming for solid consistency. Now, I need to prepare the command in JSON format for selecting those positions. Let's target positions [3, 6, 7].\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,6,7]"}
