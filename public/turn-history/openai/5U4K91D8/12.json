{"reasoning":"**Evaluating hands in poker**\n\nSo, I've figured out that Blue Joker adds +88 chips to the total, then multiplies it by the multiplier. I want hands with decent multipliers to make the best use of that +88. For example, Two Pair has a base of 40 chips with a multiplier of 3, while other combinations like Full House or Flush have high multipliers too. \n\nI can make a Two Pair with Jacks and 3s, plus a kicker like A♠. Each relevant card contributes its rank value for the hand's overall score.\n**Calculating poker chips**\n\nI'm counting up the chips from my hand: J♠ (10), J♥ (10), 3♥ (3), 3♦ (3), and A♠ (11), which totals to 37 chips. Adding the base chips of 40 brings me to 77 chips. \n\nWith Blue Joker adding +88 chips, that gives a total of 165 chips. The base multiplier is 3, leading to 495 chips overall. That seems to clear the blind, which is great! I just need to confirm that we're currently at level 2 and ensure the Blue Joker is still adding those chips considering the remaining deck.\n**Understanding the card drawing process**\n\nAt the start, there are 44 cards in the deck. When I play five cards, these get discarded, and then five are drawn, reducing the deck size to 39. However, scoring happens before the draw in Balatro, which means the scoring considers the deck at 44.\n\nI’m pretty sure the \"remaining cards in deck\" refers to the current size during scoring. So, if I score before the draw, I benefit from the +88 from Blue Joker, since the deck still has 44 cards.\n**Calculating chip totals for the hand**\n\nIf the deck has 39 cards left, I'd calculate chips as follows: starting chips plus card values gives me 77, adding 78 from the Blue Joker gives 155. Multiplying by the base multiplier of 3 results in 465 chips, which is still above 450, so I’m in a safe position. I think I’ll go for a two pair hand: Jacks and 3s with an Ace kicker, estimating around 470-500 chips. \n\nTo finalize, I’ll specify the play positions for the cards and include the command to play them.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6,8]"}
