{"reasoning":"**Calculating card probabilities**\n\nI'm figuring out the probability of holding at least one queen in 8 cards, which is about 1 - C(48,8)/C(52,8)  0.47. For two queens, it's around 0.16. The expected number of queens in my hand is calculated as 8*(4/52) = 0.615, which is decent. This adds up for a hand with jokers, especially since the Blue Joker gives big chips but no multiplier. So, overall, my action is to buy the card!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
