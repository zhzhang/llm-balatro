{"reasoning":"**Planning for scaling strategies**\n\nI'm in the shop after beating the small blind ante and have $9. I need a plan to scale up. The Blue Joker scales with the deck size, adding +2 chips for each card remaining. It seems the deck has 52 cards. The significant boost is great. “Shoot the Moon” provides a +13 multiplier per held Queen, which is powerful if I can hold onto those and play other cards. My build focuses on spade scoring and holding Queens. I might also consider buying “Even Steven” for a multiplier bonus.\n**Evaluating card synergies**\n\nI see that playing even spades synergizes well with my deck. However, I need to consider replacing an existing Joker since I can only have a maximum of five. The Showman has great utility for the shop, so I might want to keep it. The Business Card isn't as crucial right now. The Bull gives +2 chips for every dollar, which can add up but would consume a Joker slot. Even Steven offers multiplier scaling, which could be strong, especially if stacked with Wrathful for spade scoring.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI need to choose between buying the Celestial pack or the Mega Standard pack. The Celestial pack, which costs $4, can level up hand types like Two Pair, Flush, or Pair, and seems to have immediate value. Since I already play two pair often at level 3, it feels like a strong choice. The Mega Standard pack is $8 and could add cards like Queens, but I'm uncertain about its benefits. I think I'd prefer the Celestial pack first to boost my base chips and multipliers.\n**Weighing purchase options**\n\nI have $9 and could buy the Even Steven and Celestial pack, which would cost $8, leaving just $1 behind. However, I need to make space for them, so I'd have to sell a Joker for $2, which also adds some cash. Selling the Showman could free up a slot, but I question if it’s necessary at this early stage. The Business Card provides income and could keep me financially stable, but I can manage without it. The core cards seem to be Wrathful, Shoot the Moon, and the Blue Joker, so I’ll really have to consider what to drop. The Bull doesn't seem worth it since it relies on keeping money high.\n**Strategizing purchases and sales**\n\nI’m considering buying Even Steven, as it provides a +4 multiplier for each even card, which is a strong boost for two pair and flush with spades. I could sell the Showman to make space for this purchase. However, I wonder if keeping the Showman is wise since it allows duplicates of cards like Even Steven or Shoot the Moon. \n\nWith limited slots, it seems better to let the Showman go since it doesn't contribute to scoring. Buying the Celestial Pack is also a priority to level up Two Pair or Flush. \n\nI plan to sell the Showman first, which gives me some cash and frees up a slot. Then I can buy Even Steven, and with the remaining funds, purchase the Celestial Pack afterwards. I'll confirm Showman's position before executing this plan.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
