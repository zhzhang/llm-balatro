{"reasoning":"**Calculating poker strategy**\n\nI’m in big blind and need 7,500 chips, but I currently have 2,756 after the first hand. That means I need 4,744 more chips. Looking at my hand, I have Q♠, 5♠, K♥, 9♥, 4♥, A♦, 6♦, and 5♦. I'm planning to keep Q♠ for a +13 multiplier. Since I've already played a pair this round, using Card Sharp could work on my next hand.\n\nI can create a pair with my 5s. While kickers usually help, I realize they aren't necessary to score, as I can play just the two.\n**Planning my poker play**\n\nIf I only play the two 5s as a pair, those are the only cards that will score. I need to keep the Queen to avoid wasting cards, which means I'll hold onto six cards. After playing, I draw back up to eight cards, so playing two will let me refill with two new cards, which is fantastic! Now, I need to carefully estimate my chip gain from the hand. I’ll verify scoring, considering that the last action was a 3-8 pair for 2,750 chips. I need to reflect on the previous hand details too.\n**Calculating score for pair of 4s**\n\nThey just played a pair of 4s using cards 3 and 8. Now, my updated hand includes Q♠, 5♠, K♥, 9♥, 4♥, A♦, 6♦, and 5♦. This confirms the played pair. The score was 2,756, which I’ll use to calibrate my expectations. \n\nNow I’ll work out the expected score for my pair of 4s while holding onto Q♠. The base for a level 1 pair starts at 10 chips with a multiplier of 2. Each 4 gives me 4 chips, totaling 8, and the Blue Joker adds bonuses based on remaining cards, at that moment giving me an extra 88 chips. It seems this adds to my total chips, not the multiplier.\n**Calculating total chips and multiplier**\n\nAlright, I’ve figured my total chips: starting with a base of 10, then adding 8 from my cards and 88 from the Blue Joker, giving me a total of 106 chips. The base multiplier is 2.\n\nNext, I calculate my multipliers. The Wrathful Joker gives me a +3 for the spade since I only have 4♠. The Even Steven Joker gives +4 for both 4s being even, so that's an additional +8. This adds up to a multiplier of 13. \n\nSince I’m holding Q♠, I get another +13 multiplier, bringing it to a total of 26. However, Card Sharp isn’t triggered, as the first pair hasn't been played before this round. So, I end up with 106 chips multiplied by 26, which equals 2,756. That's perfect! Moving on, I’ll play my pair of 5s now, and the deck currently has 42 cards left with Blue Joker at +84.\n**Calculating final score for next hand**\n\nThe Blue Joker gives me +84 chips. Starting with base chips of 10, my scoring cards (two 5s) add another 10, totaling 104 chips. The base multiplier is 2. \n\nNext, the Wrathful Joker adds +3 since only 5♠ is a spade. Even Steven doesn’t add anything since 5 is odd, and holding Q♠ gives me +13 from Shoot the Moon. Before considering Card Sharp, my multiplier is 18. \n\nNow Card Sharp applies since I've played a pair this round, which gives me an x3 multiplier, so it becomes 54. My final score is 104 multiplied by 54, totaling 5,616 chips. Adding this to my current chips of 2,756 means I have 8,372, which exceeds 7,500! \n\nNow I’ll play my pair from positions 2 and 8 (5♠ and 5♦). I’ll keep my other cards (Q♠, K♥, 9♥, 4♥, A♦, 6♦) to maintain my hand. I’ll prepare the Action JSON to play these positions.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,8]"}
