{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop actions**\n\nI need to decide what to do next in the shop. Right now, my only option is \"The Magician,\" which costs $3. However, I can't buy it since I have full consumables. I could use the buy-and-use option, but it requires targets that I don't have. I’m considering either rerolling for $10 or ending the shop round. Since I have $16, I should probably choose to round-select to keep going. I also need to be mindful of interest from my remaining money.\n**Weighing options for The Magician**\n\nRerolling might find a strong joker, but it costs a lot. I could also sell a consumable to buy The Magician. However, since I can't target anything in the shop, I could buy it as a consumable if I have an available slot, then use it when I have a hand. To free up a slot, I need to decide which consumable to sell: Lovers or Death. Both are valuable for deck manipulation, but Death seems to offer more potential for enhancing queens. Lovers is helpful for flushes, but my strategy is more focused on pairs, so Death might be the better choice.\n**Deciding actions for shop**\n\nI could sell Lovers for $1 and then buy The Magician for $3, but I can only take one action per turn. It seems wise to sell Lovers now to make space, then use my next turn to buy The Magician, which could lead to creating Lucky cards that boost my multiplier or money. I could also consider rerolling for jokers, but my current jokers are weak. The shop shows only tarot cards, which I can use to enhance my deck. Creating Lucky cards, especially with two queens, could be huge for my strategy!\n**Strategizing for pair play**\n\nFor my pair strategy, playing a pair of lucky queens gives each a 1/5 chance to increase the multiplier, which is significant. However, I also need to hold onto queens for the Shoot the Moon strategy, although I could still play them occasionally. I can use The Magician on non-queen cards too, but my deck size is about 52, making it tough to hit specific ranks. It seems wise to sell Lovers and buy The Magician next, keeping Death for potential queen copying later. So, I'll start by selling Lovers.\n**Assessing the best action**\n\nI’m thinking about whether selling Lovers is wise since it could make a queen wild, helping with a flush or straight. However, The Magician is in the shop right now, and if I leave, it might be gone. I want to sell Lovers to free up a slot and allow me to buy The Magician next turn. Selling it gives me $1 and boosts my money to 17. So, I’ll proceed with selling Lovers now to open the slot for The Magician.\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
