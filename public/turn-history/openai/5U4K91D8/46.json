{"reasoning":"**Planning for shop scaling**\n\nI’m thinking about our shop setup. We’ve sold a showman, and we have 4 jokers with a max of 5. The shop has Bull and Even Steven, plus some boosters. We currently have $11, so I need to plan for scaling. Our build involves using Blue Joker chips based on deck size, and other effects from cards like Wrathful and Shoot the Moon. I’m also considering buying Even Steven or the Celestial pack for leveling up!\n**Evaluating card purchases**\n\nI'm thinking about my options for purchases. The Mega Standard is $8 and could add more queens and spades, but it feels costly. With $11, I could buy Even Steven and the Celestial pack for $8, leaving me with $3. Alternatively, I could buy the Director's Cut voucher for $10, allowing me to reroll bosses, but it’s a bit pricey for now.\n\nLeveling up the two pair or flush through the Celestial pack also seems important. In the end, Even Steven looks like a solid choice for immediate scoring!\n**Deciding on joker order and purchases**\n\nI'm considering keeping the Business Card because it adds income, especially since we want to hold money for interest and potential vouchers. With 5 jokers, like Blue, Shoot, and Even Steven, I can’t fit Bull; it takes up a slot but scales with money, which isn't as effective as multiplying scoring. \n\nSo my choice is to buy Even Steven, then probably the Celestial pack to help level up either Two Pair or Flush, leaving me with $3. Keeping track of the jokers' order for activation is also important since it affects how they trigger during scoring!\n**Clarifying joker interactions and effects**\n\nI'm untangling how the jokers trigger during scoring. Since \"Shoot the Moon\" is an \"on held\" joker, it triggers after scoring, so its order relative to others like Wrathful doesn’t matter much. I realize Shoot should be left-to-right among held jokers, as there’s only one.\n\nThe Blue Joker adds chips independently in step 5. If it adds after scoring, it impacts the total chips before any multiplication. Even Steven boosts the multiplier by +4 for each even card scored, while Wrathful adds +3 for spades. This is all coming together!\n**Choosing the next action**\n\nI’m figuring out the triggers for scoring and how the order increases the multiplier, but since they’re additive, it doesn’t really matter. The Business Card gives money for face cards but doesn’t affect scoring, so I might keep it for later.\n\nFor now, my next action is to buy Even Steven, which is card position 2. I think I'll also consider grabbing the Celestial booster later, but I can only pick one action right now. So, I'll proceed with buying card 2!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
