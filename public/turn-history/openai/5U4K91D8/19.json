{"reasoning":"**Weighing options in the shop**\n\nI have $3 to spend, but unfortunately, I can’t buy any of the items I want, like Shoot the Moon or boosters. My choices are to sell something or make a round_select decision. I have the Blue Joker and Arrowhead. Selling Blue could let me buy Shoot the Moon, but Blue has strong value early in the game. Arrowhead has potential synergy with spades, which I should compare. Overall, I’m leaning toward keeping Blue for now.\n**Analyzing multipliers and strategies**\n\nI’m looking at the base multipliers from hand levels, like Two Pair giving a base multiplier of 4. The chip value from Blue is strong, but later on, multipliers become crucial. Shoot the Moon can significantly boost my multiplier if I hold multiple queens, which I can control by keeping them in hand. I have a hand size of 8, which means I can hold onto those queens while playing other cards. If I draw two queens, that could add a significant +26 to my multiplier.\n**Estimating queen and spade probabilities**\n\nI’m calculating the probability of drawing at least one queen in an 8-card hand, which is about 47%. For at least two queens, it’s closer to 15%. Not the most reliable, but I can alter my chances by discarding cards to go for queens. Now, Arrowhead gives +50 chips for each scored spade, and the chance of drawing spades is roughly 25%. While it adds value before the multiplier, Arrowhead won’t help if spades aren’t in the scoring hand. Keeping Arrowhead might still be a good idea!\n**Weighing options with $3**\n\nI only have $3 at the moment, and the next blind ante is coming up. I need more power, so I’m considering selling something to buy an Arcana or Standard pack, which costs $4. If I sell Arrowhead for $3, I'd have $6 to buy the Arcana pack or Shoot the Moon, but that leaves me with little left. Selling Blue gives me just $2, which isn’t worth it. So, I think I’ll play it safe, round_select, and save my money for future purchases while evaluating the benefits of my current items.\n**Evaluating Arrowhead vs. Shoot the Moon**\n\nArrowhead could give me +100 to +200 chips before multipliers, especially with spades. In a hand with two spades, that could be around +400. Blue also contributes, depending on the remaining cards in the deck. If I keep Blue, it provides consistent chip value, while Shoot the Moon offers significant multipliers if I hold queens. Although I just bought Arrowhead, I’m considering selling it to buy Shoot, which can provide needed multiplier scaling. However, Arrowhead adds some chip flexibility and could show up again. Balancing these values and possible future scenarios is tricky!\n**Planning actions for Arrowhead and Shoot the Moon**\n\nI've decided to sell Arrowhead to buy Shoot the Moon. However, I can only perform one action per turn, so I need to plan accordingly. For my first action, I’ll sell the Arrowhead. The next turn, I can buy Shoot the Moon. It makes sense to go with sell_joker 2 first, and then I’ll follow up with buy_card 1 on the next turn. Let’s proceed with selling Arrowhead!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
