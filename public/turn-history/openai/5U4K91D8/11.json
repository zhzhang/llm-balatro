{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the game's scoring system. Since there's no other scoring, it seems fine to play big blind to earn money and shop. The tag option is tempting, but it might hurt me by missing out on shopping and money. Plus, I can't skip the boss, so I have to play. It seems better to take the $4 and shop for a joker to help. I'll proceed with the action to play the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
