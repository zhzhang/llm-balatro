{"reasoning":"**Analyzing hand combinations**\n\nI’m considering playing pairs while holding queens and how that works with my hand size. Playing a pair or two pair with queens seems easy since two pair uses four cards. I note that two pair starts at level 6 with strong chip values, while a pair is level 2. Upgrading a pair with Mercury adds a decent boost, but upgrading two pair gives a smaller increase. Since pairs are easier to repeat, I think leveling pairs is the best option.\n**Evaluating ante and scoring**\n\nI’m thinking about how the ante of 7/8 might need lots of chips, especially since two pair has a base of 120 chips. Improving that could yield better absolute scores. For estimation, spikes like pair scoring over 11,160 come from factors like held queens and card sharp x3. It seems that base hand chips and multipliers are important, along with independent factors from jokers and things like Ice Cream. I realize scaling multipliers is crucial since jokers multiply scores.\n**Upgrading pair levels**\n\nI’m considering adding a +1 multiplier to the base for pairs, which would then stack with the existing multipliers and other sources, making it really valuable! So, I think I should select Mercury. This will upgrade my pair from level 2 to level 3. According to Mercury's description, it boosts my pair with +1 multiplier and +15 chips, enhancing its strength. I’m ready to make this upgrade, so I just need to use the command to select it.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
