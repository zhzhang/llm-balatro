{"reasoning":"**Planning the hand type**\n\nI'm thinking about setting the intended hand type to \"two pair,\" as that seems like the best option. It looks like Card Sharp encourages the idea of repeating the hand. I might want to play a small two pair first, followed by another two pair with Card Sharp x3. But I realize this is more relevant for round play, not necessarily the select play. I still want to mention it, though. I’m uncertain about the estimated chips, so I’ll proceed to output the play_round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
