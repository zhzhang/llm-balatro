{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nI think we should add jokers to support our strategy with pairs or face cards. The shop has some interesting options: the Wrathful Joker gives a +3 multiplier for every spade scored, and the Business Card has a 50% chance to add $2 for face cards. I'll consider how these cards work together. Playing small pairs can trigger the Business Card, and although we have good multipliers from queens already, the additional multipliers from spades might help us reach chip thresholds with fewer queens in hand.\n**Evaluating card strategy options**\n\nAfter each round, we shuffle the discard back into the deck, so it resets to 52 cards. This means the Blue Joker returns to a +104, which is great because we'll likely see queens. For Shoot the Moon, we want to hold 1-2 queens frequently. We have three joker slots filled, and buying both the Wrathful and Business cards for $9 leaves us with $2. Although we might save for better jokers later, the Business card boosts our economy, while the Wrathful helps with multipliers for spades, which could be our focus.\n**Considering deck options and strategy**\n\nAdding a standard pack increases the deck size by one, which boosts the Blue Joker's chips by 2 for each extra card. It seems like a good net gain, but a larger deck may lower our chances of drawing queens. If we can add a queen, that would create great synergy for multiplying held queens. However, the standard pack only reveals up to three random cards, and I’m not sure if the Showman can affect the pack contents. Since it's affordable at $4, it might be worth a shot, but I should prioritize the Business Card first for better economy and synergy in the game.\n**Assessing hand strategies**\n\nI realize that while Shoot the Moon triggers held queens, we can also go for pairs of face cards, which could work well. The Business Card pays out half the time, which seems fine, but the Wrathful Joker provides multipliers. Although I wish I could get the Crazy Joker, it’s unavailable. Rerolling after a purchase could cost $5, and I’m uncertain if that’s a good idea. We need to consider the boss requirement of “Play only 1 hand type this round.” To win quickly and maximize our money, we should focus on multipliers. However, even if we don’t get queens, I estimate that with a base multiplier of 2 and the right chips, we could still need many hands to hit 1,600, but I'm hopeful we’ll have a queen.\n**Evaluating purchase strategies**\n\nWith one queen held, my multiplier would be 15, which allows for winning in a single hand at 2,010 chips, provided I have at least one queen. The odds of drawing a queen are about 47%, and I can discard to improve that chance. The Wrathful Joker could help, but I might focus on buying the Business Card first for better economy. I also consider buying standard packs for queens, but that might dilute my deck. So, perhaps just getting the Business Card is best: it's cheap, supports my strategy well, and can provide income in the next round while increasing my potential fortune without risking too much right now.\n**Finalizing the purchase strategy**\n\nThe Business Card seems like a solid option since it relies on face cards played. We might play pairs of face cards to keep queens in hand, reducing the risk of playing a queen. Each pair has a chance to earn $2 from the Business Card, which adds up nicely during gameplay. Once I buy it, I'll have $7 left. I could consider rerolling for a stronger joker, but it might be better to save that for the next shop after the boss. I'll go ahead and purchase the Business Card now, referencing it as card #2 in the shop.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
