{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m noticing that their Two Pair yielded 664 chips in boss ante1, suggesting they could hit around 800 with a hand or two. With Ante 2 at 800 for the small blind, it seems manageable. However, skipping this yields a Voucher tag that adds a voucher to the next shop, which could be beneficial but isn’t free. If I skip the small blind, I forfeit a $3 reward and a chance to shop, which I really need for packs and jokers. Playing the small blind seems better.\n**Analyzing round strategy**\n\nAt the round's end, I'm considering the money from remaining hands plus interest to help build my economy, so it’s probably best to play. Skipping the small blind could potentially provide a voucher, but I’m hesitant as I might not afford it. If I skip small and choose big, winning could take me to the shop. However, vouchers typically cost around $10, making them potentially worthless. Plus, there's an upcoming boss rule to play only one hand type, so consistency seems essential!\n**Planning for the boss battle**\n\nI've got two pair leveled to 3, so I might use that strategy for the boss. In the small and big blinds, I can still try different types while working on building my two pair and holding onto queens for multiple plays. For \"Shoot the Moon,\" holding queens boosts my multiplier, making it smart to play. I’ll focus on those actions while remembering that the order in which I trigger jokers matters — held cards activate before independent ones. I think I'm ready to play!\n**Deciding on gameplay strategy**\n\nFor \"Shoot the Moon,\" since it's a held trigger and \"Blue\" is independent, the order between them doesn't really matter. However, I should keep in mind that the ordering could impact other jokers later in the game. Because of this, I think it's best to go ahead and play the small blind. This way, I can take action without getting too caught up in the details of the triggers right now.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
