{"reasoning":"**Calculating hand scores**\n\nAlright, so Wrathful gives a +3 multiplier for each spade scored in the highest hand. If I play my pair of 9s (9H and 9C), I’ll lock into them as a Pair. The base chips for the Pair would be 10, with a total of 28 chips from the rank of the cards. Adding the Blue Joker gives me 116 chips, but my multiplier is just 2, leading to a total of 232. That's too low to reach 1600 with just four hands.\n**Estimating Two Pair score**\n\nOkay, with a Two Pair hand of 10s (10H and 10D) and 9s (9H and 9C), that feels pretty strong! Let’s calculate the score: the base chips for Two Pair at level 3 are 60, plus the chip values for the four cards give me 38, totaling 98 chips before the Blue Joker. Adding the Blue Joker, I get 186 chips. The multiplier is 4, so my total chips amount to 744. That’s still shy of 1600, so I'd need to play more hands or improve my cards.\n**Assessing hand options**\n\nSo, if I play 10H, 10D, 9H, 9C, and KD, I still have a Two Pair hand with a King kicker. However, in Balatro, only the four cards contribute to the score, meaning the kicker doesn't help. Keeping the King in hand doesn’t seem beneficial unless for later. I could consider a Full House, but that’s not an option right now. A straight isn’t available, and while I can aim for a flush with my hearts, the Two Pair still looks better for scoring. My goal remains to beat 1600, possibly by getting queens for that multiplier!\n**Planning for card play**\n\nIf I play a 4-card Two Pair while keeping 4 cards in hand, and if I can draw two queens, that’s a big boost with a +26 multiplier! My total multiplier could go up to 30, boosting my chips to 5580, which is fantastic. It's smart to aim for queens before finalizing my play. However, I can’t discard without risking my current Two Pair, so I’ll plan to discard the 6H, 3H, 4C, and KD to try for new draws while maintaining my strong hand with 10H, 9H, 9C, and 10D.\n**Chasing queens and spades**\n\nI’m considering using discards to chase after queens and spades. If I find spade cards among my scoring pairs, that could boost my multiplier by +3 for each, but I currently don’t have any spades. However, I can still trade a rank 9 or 10 for a spade if I get one. My main focus should be on holding queens, as having them gives a significant multiplier increase.\n\nSo, I’ll plan to discard the non-pair cards (positions 3, 4, 6, and 7) to try to draw queens or spades. This way, I’ll keep my Two Pair intact. I’ll need to reassess after the discard and draw new cards!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,6,7]"}
