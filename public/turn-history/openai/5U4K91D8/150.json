{"reasoning":"**Calculating flush strategies**\n\nI realize that I need to discard two random cards per hand, which complicates things with held Queens. But with the sun helping, I might achieve easier flushes using the current hearts count. I aim for 52.5k—previously, I got 25.762.5 with a smaller flush. The plan is to trigger Card Sharp with a repeat flush, focusing on playing a low flush first and then a bigger one. Alternatively, a two-pair play could work, but the flush tends to yield higher multipliers.\n**Evaluating flush strategy**\n\nI need to consider that each queen held provides a +13 multiplier, and I currently have the Queen of Diamonds. If I play a 5-card hand without a queen, I can keep the multiplier, which is good! I'm aiming for a club flush, and my first action should be to discard to draw a fifth club while keeping the queen. I can discard non-clubs and keep my essential cards, like Q♦. By discarding four cards, I’ll increase my chances of drawing clubs, which should give me a decent probability of about 57.5%.\n**Determining discard strategy**\n\nI’m considering my options and think it might be best to discard some cards for a better chance at a flush. I note I have four 4s and three 10s, which could influence my decision. However, I need to keep my clubs to maintain flush potential. Discarding the 3♣ would reduce my flush chance unless I can replace it with another club. So, I'll discard cards 1, 2, 3, and 9, keeping Q♦ at position 8. Next, I'll prepare the action JSON for this discard.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,9]"}
