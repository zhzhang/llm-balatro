{"reasoning":"**Analyzing poker strategy**\n\nI’m considering a poker hand with four queens, so drawing one seems likely. My strategy involves using discards to create a strong two pair, potentially adding a queen to multiply my chances. I could also aim for a flush with clubs since I have four already: AC, JC, 9C, and 5C. I’d need one more to complete it. Alternatively, there’s a chance to make a straight with cards like 5C, 6H, and 7D, but I’d still need the 8.\n**Evaluating poker hand strategy**\n\nI’m analyzing my poker hand options. A straight gives a base of 30 with a multiplier of 4, but it might not be enough for 2000 chips. Aiming for a flush or two pair with spades is tempting, but I think I should discard three non-club cards. Keeping my clubs while discarding others increases my chances of drawing a fifth club, with about a 62% probability of getting at least one from four draws. However, I need to be careful since keeping four clubs keeps my hand at size 8.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nWhen playing, I can select five cards. Ideally, I’d aim for a flush with five clubs if I have them. If not, I could consider two pair with kings, but I'd risk discarding them, losing that potential pair. Still, I can make two pair using clubs. It seems wiser to keep three off-suit cards while holding onto the kings. However, keeping the kings reduces my chances of drawing additional clubs. To maximize my chances of getting a club, I should discard four non-clubs. Unfortunately, this does mean losing a pair of kings, but I might still draw another one.\n**Strategizing with the deck**\n\nI’m considering the deck where there are two kings remaining along with the two I have, totaling four. If I discard the kings, they go to the discard pile and won't be drawn again until a reshuffle. This could be fine since I’m focusing on setting up a flush and potentially drawing queens, of which there are four remaining. Discarding kings seems viable because holding queens can trigger bonuses. With an 8-card hand, I can keep queens in reserve to enhance my multipliers if I draw them into my remaining slots.\n**Strategizing my poker hand**\n\nI'm planning to go for a flush with five clubs, which gives a base multiplier, plus bonuses for holding queens. Each queen held boosts the multiplier significantly, so ideally, I want at least one. Discarding non-essential cards will maximize my chances of drawing a queen and clubs. I can discard four non-clubs while keeping my kings, as drawing a queen is critical for raising my score. Each possible hand type presents strategic choices, especially with the potential for spade bonuses. My goal is to configure the best combination for the remaining rounds.\n**Planning my poker hand strategy**\n\nI'm considering my deck and the abundance of spades, thinking about building a flush in that suit later. For today, the focus is on collecting queens to boost my score via Shoot the Moon. Discarding face cards that don't help is a priority, but I need to be cautious about discarding clubs necessary for a flush. The analysis of various hands shows I need either a strong two pair or a flush to reach 2000 points, ideally with queens involved. Analyzing my potential draws, it might be best to discard cards that hinder my straight or flush chances. I will discard wisely to optimize my hand while aiming for that crucial eighth card to complete my straight. Hopefully, this approach will work toward achieving my goal!\n**Deciding on my hand strategy**\n\nI realize that to make a straight, I need five specific cards, and I already have 5, 6, 7, and 9. I just need an 8 to complete it. The probability to draw an 8 is about 32%. However, I could also consider keeping my kings since they can form a pair. Evaluating my options, the flush plan looks better, with a 62% chance of drawing at least one club. I plan to discard four non-clubs and look to complete the flush while keeping my strategy for the future. Let's execute the discard!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
