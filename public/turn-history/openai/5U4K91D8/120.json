{"reasoning":"**Assessing game strategy**\n\nI'm considering the Juggle tag, which gives me an extra +3 hand size for the next round, likely benefitting the big blind. Right now, we have Paint Brush adding +1, which could be pivotal for Shoot the Moon since I want more queens in hand. Clearing the small blind of 20k seems manageable with a couple of good pairs—maybe 2-3 hands could do it. But if I skip, I'll conserve Ice Cream and reduce the risk, especially since Ice Cream loses 5 chips each hand played. Skipping would mean fewer hands and might be the better choice, especially given the approaching endgame stakes.\n**Weighing strategy for boss jump**\n\nI'm considering whether to skip the small and big blinds to reach the boss more quickly. Skipping the big blind would give me the valuable Polychrome tag, allowing for a joker-free shop in the next base edition. However, if I skip both the small and big blinds, I won't access the shop at all. After skipping the big blind, I'm likely going straight to the boss, which means I'd miss two shops and their rewards. But with the Polychrome tag, I'd have a strong chance at a good joker after beating the boss. That could be huge!\n**Evaluating shop and tag trade-offs**\n\nI'm weighing the sacrifice of two shops against the benefits of rerolls and the last shop being empty. I have the tarot merchant, so shops typically offer tarots anyway. I could skip the small blind, still get the Juggle tag, and then play big, allowing for a shop after. But skipping the big blind would mean losing out on the Polychrome tag. If I skip big, I go straight to the boss and then shop after beating him at ante 6. So, I need to consider if getting the Polychrome tag is worth it.\n**Balancing rewards and tags**\n\nIt seems better to get one shop and a $3 reward while also keeping the option for Polychrome. The downside here is that I won't get the Juggle tag, which only adds +3 hand size next round. That might actually be less valuable than Polychrome. I could potentially get both by skipping the small for Juggle and then the big for Polychrome. This means no shop before facing the boss, but I’d have the +3 hand size to help beat the 40k. So, skipping small and big might be the best strategy!\n**Determining strategy on skips and rewards**\n\nMissing the shop could hurt during tougher antes, but the Polychrome joker in the next shop might offset that. Currently, I have useful jokers like Shoot the Moon, which is stronger with queens. I need to evaluate if I can beat the boss with the 40k requirement. I could hold multiple queens to increase my multiplier significantly. While the diamond debuff means those cards won’t score, held queens should still count for multipliers. Given the stakes, skipping both blinds for valuable tags seems like a good plan, so I’ll decide to skip the small blind.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
