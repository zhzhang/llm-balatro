{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI'm figuring out the benefits of different card bonuses. Wrathful gives a +3 multiplier for each spade card played, while Even Steven adds +4 for each even rank played. Card Sharp provides a x3 multiplier for repeating a poker hand played in the same round. Since the first hand won't get x3, I'll need to plan around that. My strongest hands have a variety of multipliers, and I ultimately need 4000 in four hands. So, I'll start with a solid medium hand!\n**Evaluating hand options**\n\nI can go with a Pair of 8s or aim for a Two Pair, depending on the unknown cards that could match with 10, A, 2, or 8. But since the unknowns are face cards, I can't make a Two Pair with the 8s unless there’s another pair among them. With three unknowns, it's possible but uncertain. I might just stick with the Pair of 8s, using 8♥ and 8♣. It seems I should avoid adding cards that won’t contribute to the score.\n**Calculating potential hand improvements**\n\nI’m considering if discarding cards could help form a Two Pair, but we already have a solid Pair of 8s, boosted by the Blue Joker for +88 chips. My estimation goes like this: starting with 10 base chips and a multiplier of 2, adding the 8s gives me 16 chips, totaling 26. Then adding the Blue Joker brings it to 114. The multipliers from Wrathful and Even Steven boost it further. I need to think about keeping queens in hand since they could also score if they show up among the unknowns!\n**Estimating queen multipliers**\n\nI'm considering how much each queen held in hand adds, which is +13 to the multiplier. The remaining deck might show three unknown face cards, with a distribution of Queens, Jacks, and Kings. The probability of drawing a queen among these unknowns seems to be around 1 in 3, so I might expect one queen, adding another +13 multiplier.\n\nWith that estimate, the total multipliers come to 23, which gives a final chips count of 2,622 — close to 4000 but still short. I should aim for a Two Pair or Straight to be safe!\n**Strategizing for optimal play**\n\nTo use Card Sharp effectively, I’ll start by playing my Pair of 8s, scoring some chips, and then play a second Pair with a x3 multiplier to possibly exceed 7000, which is great! The goal is to not necessarily win the first hand, but if I do, it’ll be fine. If I don’t get any queens, the plan is still solid, as I can compute different outcomes. Holding onto unknown face cards could be beneficial in forming more hands later, especially since they might include queens. I’ll play my Pair of 8s and proceed with positions [3,5]!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,5]"}
