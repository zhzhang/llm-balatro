{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card probabilities**\n\nI'm exploring the probability of drawing 5 cards and getting no pairs. With only 3 ranks, it's impossible because, by the pigeonhole principle, I must have at least one pair. So, if I draw 5 cards, I definitely have a pair among them. I’m considering if I might play two unknown cards, but there's a chance they won't match. To ensure a pair, I can play all 5 face-down cards. I realize this could lead to hands like a full house or four of a kind based on the combinations.\n**Analyzing poker hands**\n\nI'm evaluating poker hands, noting that our highest hand currently is Two Pair at level 4, which offers a solid 80 chips with a multiplier. But if I think back, we already played a Pair, which gives us a massive x3 multiplier for repeating it. Still, a Full House could potentially give us even more value, especially since it's a different hand from what we played earlier. To get a Pair this time, I need to select exactly two cards of the same rank and avoid making any higher combinations.\n**Planning card plays**\n\nI'm considering the strategy for playing only 2 cards without knowing which ones will match. If I play 3 or 4 cards, I might be able to form a pair or three of a kind, but that complicates things. Since I just need a score of 1378, maybe just one set like a Three of a Kind or Two Pair is sufficient, even without a card sharp multiplier. I think using discards could help identify good cards, but the face cards will remain face down, limiting my options. It seems a bit tricky!\n**Exploring card strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about how to play a hand without messing it up, particularly using known non-face cards. I could play a high card like A♣ while keeping queens to trigger \"shoot the moon.\" If I just play A♣, I’ll hold on to 5 unknown face cards plus 4♥ and 7♣. Each queen adds a nice multiplier, which is promising. I need to calculate if this could help me reach 1378 points, especially with the high card's contribution of 11 to my score.\n**Calculating poker outcomes**\n\nI'm working through the points for my hand and the potential scores. Starting with 16 chips plus a blue joker gives me 92 chips total. My high card A♣ could lead to some interesting multipliers. I need to estimate expected queens from my five face cards, figuring I should get at least one since there are only four non-queen faces. If I manage to hold at least one queen, it looks like my score could surpass 1378 when I play 4♥, especially with the additional multipliers from the queens!\n**Analyzing hand options**\n\nI'm calculating scores based on various card plays. If I play 4♥, I get 85 chips with a multiplier, especially if there's at least one queen held, which I expect due to the counts. However, I need to remember that the remaining deck counts don’t confirm what's in my hand. I’ve deduced there should be at least a pair among my 5 face cards due to rank limitations. This means I could end up with a strong Two Pair. Yet, I need to be cautious about relying solely on queens for multipliers.\n**Calculating hand possibilities**\n\nI'm analyzing card plays focusing on creating strategic pairs and possible multipliers for scoring. If I aim for a Full House with my 5 face cards, I need to ensure I can reach enough points. My analysis shows that relying on spades for multipliers is uncertain, but I could create a pair with the Even Steven rule for extra benefits. I'm also assessing the chance of drawing additional cards to make effective pairs or sets. My goal is to maximize my score while navigating these variables carefully!\n**Assessing card strategies**\n\nI'm trying to figure out my best move with these cards. I can play 4♥ along with 4 face cards, but that means I could only have a single pair or maybe two pairs at best. If I don't include spades or queens, my multipliers drop significantly. I could aim for a pair of 4s by drawing another 4, but the math on that seems tricky. I want to increase my chances of having at least one queen while keeping my options open for the next plays. It's a balancing act!\n**Deciding on card plays**\n\nI'm thinking about discarding some unknown face cards to draw new ones, but that might shift the distribution. The chances of queens among the face cards are about 1/3, which isn't a certainty. I might play 4♥ alone to keep more face cards in my hand, aiming at a high card play with just that. If I incorporate Ace and 7 of clubs, I lose potential multipliers, so sticking with just 4♥ seems smarter. My estimate for chips is around 2000, so let's go with that!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3]"}
