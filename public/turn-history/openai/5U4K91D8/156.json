{"reasoning":"**Considering purchases in shop**\n\nI'm at the shop with $7 after winning. There's a Fibonacci joker for $8, but I can't afford it. The Hermit tarot card costs $3 and doubles my money up to $20, which makes sense to buy. I can use the buy_and_use_consumable function for it, and afterward, I’ll have $8. Then I could buy either a Jumbo Celestial for $6 or an Arcana pack for $4 with the $8 I have left.\n**Weighing options for purchases**\n\nThe Celestial pack will include a pair planet, likely Mercury, which boosts my pair level. This is useful since pairs are most commonly played, though flushes are also strong options. The pack offers choices to improve pairs further, while flushes come from the card sharp. \n\nI should buy the Jumbo Celestial pack for $6 after using The Hermit, which brings my money to $8. This way, I can focus on scaling my hand levels effectively. The first step is to use the Hermit to increase my funds.\n**Evaluating selling for Fibonacci**\n\nI'm considering whether I should sell something to afford the Fibonacci card for $8. After using The Hermit, I’ll have $8, but I need an empty joker slot since mine is currently full with five. Selling a joker could work, but is Fibonacci strong enough for my deck? It triggers on A, 2, 3, 5, and 8, providing a multiplier when scored. I notice I often play flushes that include these ranks. My current core setup offers some great multipliers, but I have limited joker slots. I need to figure out which joker to replace. The Blue Joker provides a significant boost, while Ice Cream's value is declining.\n**Analyzing multipliers and chips**\n\nThe Ice Cream chip is worth 50, but its significance seems less since chips scale lower than multipliers. Multipliers are crucial, especially at high thresholds. The Walkie Talkie offers a x1.5 multiplier and adds chips for every four or ten played. Plus, with the polychrome edition, it multiplies that by another x1.5, leading to a total of x2.25 when combined. \n\nAlongside the Card Sharp, which multiplies further, and the Shoot the Moon effect, it’s clear that this setup can be quite multipliers-heavy, especially with the Fibonacci providing +8 for each scored Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8.\n**Strategizing purchases and actions**\n\nIn a flush of 5 cards, I could potentially score 2-3 of those, adding a significant multiplier. Ice Cream gives chips but not multipliers, while the Walkie Talkie enhances multipliers. If I sell Ice Cream for $2, I could reach $9, allowing me to buy the Fibonacci card for $8 immediately, freeing a slot. Alternatively, using The Hermit to boost my funds to $8 also requires selling something.\n\nBuying the Jumbo Celestial pack for immediate scaling might be a better option, given our next challenge. Ultimately, keeping my options open for leveling pairs with the Celestial pack could be essential.\n**Optimizing scoring with Fibonacci**\n\nThe Fibonacci card could boost every scoring, especially flushes, by adding significant multipliers. My current flush multiplier is 8 at level 3, and with extra contributions from queens held, I could reach a total of around 38 before applying x multipliers. \n\nIf I sell Ice Cream for $2, I'd have $9, allowing me to buy Fibonacci for $8, which seems the most impactful move. Losing Ice Cream mainly affects chips, but with the Blue Joker's high chip count, switching to Fibonacci likely provides better long-term multipliers. Therefore, the plan is to sell Ice Cream first and then buy Fibonacci.\n**Deciding next action**\n\nMy first action is to sell, but the system may prompt for the next move afterward, which is fine. Selling Ice Cream first seems best, although I had briefly considered buying the Fibonacci card directly. \n\nShould I buy a jumbo celestial pack instead? It’d improve hand levels but not necessarily offer the multipliers I might need. Selling the Ice Cream allows for a stronger strategy moving forward. So, I’ll stick to selling Ice Cream as my plan, then I'll respond with the action in JSON format.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
