{"reasoning":"**Optimizing joker order**\n\nI’m thinking about rearranging the jokers for optimal scoring. The effects apply left-to-right, so I’ll consider things like Shoot the Moon, which gives a +13 multiplier per queen held, and then Blue Joker for extra chips. As I analyze the order, some jokers might be held-in-hand, triggering differently. Card Sharp seems to operate independently but scores after the hand. I believe the order for scoring should prioritize additive multipliers before the multiplicative ones for maximum benefit.\n**Clarifying joker effects**\n\nIn step 5, I'm thinking about the independent jokers’ order from left to right, considering additive multipliers first, followed by multiplicative ones. Card Sharp, which provides a x3 multiplier, should be placed last among scoring-independent jokers to maximize the additive bonuses. The Blue Joker and Ice Cream add chips but not multipliers, so their order isn't crucial unless other effects come into play. I might consider moving Shoot the Moon to an earlier position, but since there’s no shop items available, I’ll just proceed with my current plan.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
