{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about various card combines, like selling a blue card and shooting for a total of 7, but that might be too much of a loss. Another option might be selling a walkie and shooting for the moon, totaling 6, allowing us to maintain some valuable cards. The polychrome aspect of the walkie and the potential multiplier from holding queens also weigh into my decision making. I'm weighing the value of keeping large multipliers versus selling cards to buy a Jumbo Celestial.\n**Evaluating card upgrades**\n\nI'm considering whether to trade away cards like Walkie or Shoot the Moon for a Telescope that guarantees me a planet for my most played hand, the Pair. Upgrading from L4 to L5 might increase my base chips and multiplier, but I’m not clear on the increments. I’m worried that while an upgrade could help, it may not be as impactful as losing a joker. Plus, the planets get consumed right away, benefiting a hand I play frequently.\n**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm exploring whether to keep my jokers or sell them for cash. We’re currently at Ante 7 in Round 15, likely just finishing the Big Blind. The structure has three blinds per ante, and the Boss Blind is next. It’s crucial to remain strong since I don't have any money right now. Selling some items could provide funds for interest, but I think it might be better to hold onto the jokers and focus on playing the Boss Blind instead.\n**Evaluating card choices**\n\nI'm contemplating whether selling Shoot the Moon would be a smart move since it seems less utilized. My focus might shift toward maximizing multipliers from Fibonacci and Walkie. The issue is that Shoot the Moon only activates when I have queens in hand, which could be tricky if I'm playing flushes where a queen may not be held. It’s possible to build a flush without using a queen, but without seeing the deck's makeup, I’m unsure how often I hold queens, considering there are four in the deck.\n**Analyzing card multipliers**\n\nI’m trying to break down how the Blue Joker impacts my deck and chance of getting queens. It looks like with a full deck, I have a 56% chance to hold at least one queen in a 9-card hand, yielding an average multiplier of about +9. Selling the Walkie Talkie seems risky since it offers significant additive and multiplicative benefits due to its polychrome edition. I think I should proceed to round select without rearranging jokers too much, as the existing order seems fine for maximizing scoring triggers.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
