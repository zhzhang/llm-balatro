{"reasoning":"**Choosing a planet**\n\nI'm in PLANET_PACK and need to choose a planet right away. My options are Uranus for a Two Pair level up, Earth for a Full House, or Pluto for a High Card. Given that Two Pair is my most played and highest level, choosing Uranus for the level up seems wise. Upgrading to level 4 gives me +20 chips and +1 multiplier, which could be significant. I'll go with Uranus and select it now!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
