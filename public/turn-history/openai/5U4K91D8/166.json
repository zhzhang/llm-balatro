{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card play mechanics**\n\nI'm sorting through how card play affects the deck. After playing a hand, the deck size decreased from 38 to 31, which means 7 cards are accounted for – 5 played and 2 discarded by the boss. This means for each hand, 2 random cards are discarded, effectively reducing the deck size. So now, if I discard, it'll lower the deck by 5. However, using the Blue Joker to help with a flush may be worthwhile despite using one of my two remaining discards.\n**Estimating flush scoring**\n\nI'm trying to estimate the scoring for a flush with a multiplier of x3. I need about 58k in 3 hands. In a previous round, a flush yielded between 35k and 45k, with one hand reaching 40,185 thanks to a Card Sharp bonus. If I can pull off two x3 flushes, that could wrap things up for me. With just three hands, I should aim for over 30k in the first flush, then two more yielding around 15k each. I’m focusing on discarding to get that spade flush, but I also wonder if we might consider a straight flush if we can draw the right cards.\n**Calculating flush potential**\n\nI need to be careful because if I use both discards without getting a flush, I can still play two pairs—though that’s likely fine. Let’s work out the scoring for a spade flush with 10♠, 9♠, 9♠, 3♠, and an unknown card X♠. The base value of a flush is 65 chips. If X is 8♠ or 5♠, that changes the total. I also get a boost from the Walkie Talkie, which adds more chips and even multiplies my score. If I score well, I could end up with a good multiplier!\n**Evaluating flush scoring potential**\n\nI'm looking at the scoring for my flush strategy. If I can hold my queens, I could trigger a \"Shoot the Moon.\" The Card Sharp gives me a multiplier of 3 for 84, and then the Walkie Talkie adds another 1.5. So, I calculate the total chips, but it seems low at about 20,916. I need about 58k total, but my flush might only yield 20k without more multipliers. However, I realize I can get that x3 multiplier on additional flushes, so if I can get two more, that's hope for reaching my target!\n**Analyzing flush and pairing options**\n\nI'm considering if my flush could yield more than 20k by possibly drawing an Ace of Spades. If I get that, it could enhance my chips and multipliers. I have two 9s already, which helps, but I wonder if making a two pair could be more beneficial using 10♠ and 4♣ for added multipliers through the Walkie Talkie. In testing this option, my calculations lead to a total that still feels too low. So, I realize I need to discard non-spades to seek that crucial fifth spade. My next action will be to discard cards 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8,9]"}
