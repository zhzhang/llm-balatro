{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop where the Drunkard joker costs $4 and The Magician tarot is priced at $3. My consumables are full, so I can't buy The Magician unless I use a buy_and_use action, which allows immediate use but requires targets. Unfortunately, since I have no hand shown, I can’t target anything now. I can only buy the Drunkard, reroll for $10, or sell something. It looks like I need to evaluate which joker to sell.\n**Assessing card decisions**\n\nThe popcorn currently gives +20 multipliers, but it decays at -4 per round, meaning it might be lower soon. Ice cream and blue chips contribute +100 and +104, respectively. Since Shoot the Moon is essential, and Card Sharp x3 is significant, I might consider replacing popcorn. While it's decent, its decay makes it less appealing compared to the multiplier potential of queens. I'm thinking of selling popcorn for $2 to buy the Drunkard for a net cost of $2. However, I can only take one action per turn, so I need to decide.\n**Deciding on actions in shop**\n\nI could sell a joker now and then buy the Drunkard next turn, but what if it disappears during a reroll? The shop likely stays open until I choose, but each action in this interface counts as one. It seems I should buy Drunkard right now if I can, since I have full jokers. Selling Popcorn might be worth it, but I could also consider rerolling for a stronger joker. Reroll costs $10, though, which isn't great for my low funds. I think selling Popcorn is the best option to buy Drunkard next.\n**Making the final decision**\n\nWithout the popcorn, my total would be 166, which isn't huge, but I know it will decay to 16 by the next round. Selling the popcorn is definitely the right move then. So, my action will be to sell the popcorn now for 4. This seems like the best option to maintain my multipliers and give me the chance to buy the Drunkard in the next turn.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
