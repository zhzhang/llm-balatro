{"reasoning":"**Evaluating planet options**\n\nI'm considering which planet to pick, focusing on pairs and two pairs for our strategy. Pair is at level 3, and choosing Mercury upgrades it to level 4, which is appealing. I've noted that Uranus would level the two pair, but we already have a strong level 6 there. For endgame, boosting the multiplier is key, especially with tools we have. So, Mercury seems like the best choice overall, even over other options like Jupiter or Earth.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
