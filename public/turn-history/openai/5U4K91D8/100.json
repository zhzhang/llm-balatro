{"reasoning":"**Considering shop options**\n\nI’m in a shop that’s currently empty, and I’ve got a couple of choices: I can either reroll the shop or select a round. I have $45 available, and rerolling costs $5. It feels a little like a dilemma because I want to make the best choice! Do I go for a reroll and hope for better items, or stick with what I have? I'm leaning towards rerolling, but I need to think it over!\n**Evaluating options for growth**\n\nI’m weighing my options with a Seed Money interest cap of $50. Holding onto money generates high interest, and I’m currently at $45. The interest for the next round will depend on how much I have after this one. Shopping could help, but I don't have any cards right now. Rerolling for $5 could uncover useful items like tarots or jokers, which might improve my ante for the remaining rounds. I need to balance this with keeping some cash on hand!\n**Deciding on rerolls and multipliers**\n\nI’ve got $45, so I can reroll a few times while still earning high interest. However, interest is only awarded at the end of the round, and spending money now reduces my potential for that. If I spend $5, I’d drop to $40, making my interest only $8. Rerolling could lead to something great, but I’m also considering how to organize my jokers since the order can affect triggers and multipliers. It’s a lot to think about!\n**Analyzing multiplier interactions**\n\nI'm thinking about how each effect modifies chips or multipliers and how the order affects their interactions. For instance, Card Sharp's x3 multiplier should come after an additive multiplier, as it multiplies the current multiplier at that point. Since Blue Joker adds chips but doesn’t change the multiplier, the order is mostly critical only between x-multipliers and +multipliers. We don't have +multipliers, so it seems fine to place Card Sharp after other x-multipliers. I’m ready to reroll to explore more options!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
