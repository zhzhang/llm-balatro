{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m in a shop with $4 and have already bought some vouchers. I’m looking at my options: Saturn planet for $3, Zany Joker for $4, Arcana pack for $4, and Buffoon pack for $4. I need to pick the best investment. With a maximum of 5 jokers already filled, buying a new one requires selling an existing one. The Zany Joker isn’t a good fit for my strategy of two pair or Shoot the Moon. Arcana pack offers benefits but is confusing regarding deck size.\n**Analyzing deck dynamics**\n\nI’m realizing that deck count scales with the number of cards remaining at scoring time. At the beginning of the round, I had 52 cards, but earlier there were 42. After the round, the deck resets, meaning it includes all cards again. The Blue Joker benefits from a larger deck, so I shouldn’t remove too many cards. The Arcana pack allows me to choose tarot cards to use immediately, but some may require specific targets. I need to consider how to use them effectively.\n**Considering tarot and upgrades**\n\nIn the game, I can choose a tarot from the pack selection and use it with a target from my hand. When I select a tarot that requires targets, it prompts me for options from my deck. Buying a booster might introduce a choice state that isn’t clear yet. Picking tarots like The Magician or Chariot could be beneficial, but they come with risks. Having a Tarot Merchant means getting more frequent options, which is helpful. Buying Saturn for $3 seems like a solid upgrade for my strategy.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nAt Ante 4, I need stronger hands, and leveling a straight could be a good alternative, but it requires five cards. My current jokers and strategies like Even Steven or Shoot the Moon don’t directly support straights. Two pair remains a solid option. Buying the Arcana pack for $4 might yield strong tarots like Death or Devil, which offer great benefits but must be used immediately. I also have to consider my joker lineup since the Blue Joker gives a significant chip boost. I’ll weigh the options carefully.\n**Deciding on enhancements**\n\nHolding queens for “Shoot the Moon” could be game-changing, and “Wrathful” adds a strong multiplier for spade-heavy hands. “Even Steven” also looks good with two pair, while “Card Sharp” provides a significant boost if I repeat a hand this round. Since my jokers are all solid, I'm considering using my remaining $4 on the Arcana pack for deck improvement. I could also buy Saturn to upgrade my straight, but I think the immediate benefits of the Arcana pack outweigh the risk. Let’s go for it!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
