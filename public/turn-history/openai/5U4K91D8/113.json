{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm at the shop and considering my choices. I have $35, but rerolling costs $8, and I need to think about how to maximize my resources. I already ante $6, so for future rounds, a stronger position would help. With an empty shop, rerolling might be the best option, but it only affects the \"cards\" section. I could generate tarot or other beneficial items, but I must weigh the risks and potential rewards carefully.\n**Strategizing planet purchases**\n\nI notice that with no target planets, I can buy and use which is great. Rerolling might help me find planets to level up my pair, but my current pair level is only 2. Since my strategy relies on pairs, enhancing my hand is crucial. I need to keep queens while aiming for a pair, especially since my Card Sharp build requires repetition. It seems rerolling for planets like Mercury could be a good move since they can enhance my overall strategy.\n**Clarifying planet abilities and strategy**\n\nI realize that Mercury represents a pair, Venus is for three of a kind, and Earth might be a full house. Standard options include Pluto as a high card, while Mars is four of a kind, Jupiter is a flush, Saturn is a straight, Uranus represents two pairs, and Neptune is a straight flush. However, I can't modify the deck with cards like Death or Lovers since I need target cards. So, my immediate action should be to reroll the shop. Considering selling a consumable first might also help. Plus, I need to keep track of how Popcorn decays over rounds!\n**Planning the next move**\n\nI'm currently at ante 6, round 12, and I need to prepare to face the big boss soon—probably in rounds 13-14. Popcorn will lose about 4 per round, but it’ll still be useful for a couple more rounds. My plan is to reroll for a better joker, something like Cavendish. Since I have limited slots, I might need to sell something, especially if I can find something better than my current Blue Joker or Ice Cream. Since the shop is empty, rerolling is the best option right now, so I'll go ahead and reroll the shop!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
