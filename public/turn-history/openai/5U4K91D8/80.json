{"reasoning":"**Considering shopping decisions**\n\nI’m figuring out my options in the shop with $3. I can't buy the to-do list for $4 or the jumbo standard for $6, and rerolling costs $5, so I think I need to end the shop round.. But what if I sell a joker for $2? That would give me $5, which could allow me to buy the to-do list. It offers a $4 score when I have a pair, but I'd risk losing a scoring joker. My current scoring relies on other strategies too.\n**Evaluating scoring strategy**\n\nI’m trying to decide whether replacing a multiplier on scored cards (Even Steven or Wrathful) with the to-do list is worth it. Since I'm at ante5, I need score scaling, not just money. My seed money is low, and selling a joker could hurt future scoring potential. So maybe I should just proceed to the next round. But I wonder if I should rearrange the order of jokers, as it seems to matter for triggers. The order affects scoring, especially with independent jokers, so I'll need to optimize that.\n**Analyzing joker interaction**\n\nI’m thinking about the Blue Joker and its independent chips. It seems like they might add to the chips, but those are independent from Wrathful and Even Steven, which trigger multipliers. The order among these doesn’t matter since both add a multiplier. For independent cards like Blue and Card Sharp, the independence of chip addition and multiplier triggers creates a separate calculation until the final multiplication. In this case, the order isn't relevant, so I’ll just proceed to round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
