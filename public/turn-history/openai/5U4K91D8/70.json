{"reasoning":"**Analyzing poker hand levels**\n\nI’m thinking about our hand levels, particularly the two pair at level 5 with a base of 100 and a multiplier of 6. If the boss decreases the level each time it’s played, we could drop to level 4, which makes scoring trickier. I wonder if I should avoid repeating the same hand types? The Arm’s rule about decreasing levels complicates things. Plus, there's the decision about buying a Flash Card, which would require selling a joker. I'm considering which one to part with.\n**Evaluating hand dynamics**\n\nMy hand size is typically 8, which means the Blue Joker will use the remaining cards in the deck—52 minus 8 leaves 44, plus discards likely generates about +88 chips. That's a big boost, especially with multipliers. If I can hold onto 2-3 queens, Shoot Moon can grant +13 multipliers per queen, which sounds great! I’m also considering the implications of Wrathful and Even Steven for scoring. If I lean towards spades or even ranks, those might be more beneficial, but I’m still debating on the flush option. I could buy a Flash Card with my funds and still have some left over.\n**Assessing expenditures and strategy**\n\nRerolling costs 5, which feels pretty steep. The Flash Card's real benefit only shows if we reroll multiple times later, making it viable for the long term. Adding a standard card to the deck can boost Blue Joker chips, but it seems marginal—just +2 chips for one card added. Spending 4 seems better as a saving strategy since interest accumulates at $1 per $5 at the round's end. With $12 now, I'll want to keep at least $10 to earn $2 in interest. The next boss could be tough, but my chip output is solid.\n**Deciding on rerolls and purchases**\n\nI realize I can still generate substantial chips with the jokers and Blue. It makes me think about rerolling at the shop for a tarot card to prepare, especially since they appear more with a voucher. However, right now, the shop only offers the Flash Card. Rerolling would cost 5, but maybe finding tarot cards like The Fool or Death could be valuable. Since I currently have 0 consumable slots, I can buy one, but the shop isn’t showing consumables. I have to decide quickly before the boss arrives!\n**Weighing options for the upcoming boss**\n\nThe Flash Card doesn’t seem appealing unless I plan to reroll. Rerolling might help me find consumables for the boss fight. However, the shop only has the Flash Card available right now, and I wonder if buying a standard pack would be worth it instead. I have 12 but need at least 10 to earn interest. Given the boss's challenges, maybe I should reroll the shop once, even if it costs 5, to see if I can score some valuable tarot cards. Keeping my funds for interest could be crucial too!\n**Strategizing for the boss battle**\n\nIt seems wise to play less important hand types during the boss fight to absorb any debuffs while preserving my valuable two pair. Since the Arm reduces the hand level type you play, I could use lower hands like high cards to chip away without losing my two pair level 5. While I could entertain purchasing items to bolster my score, my current setup seems strong enough. I’ve decided to skip additional spending, save my money for future interest, and proceed to the round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
