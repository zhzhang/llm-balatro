{"reasoning":"**Selecting the best planet pack**\n\nI'm looking at the five planets in the pack and I'm leaning towards selecting Mercury. It's already at level 6, and leveling it to 7 will give me a +1 multiplier and +15 chips. I think it's best to keep scaling the pair since that's what I play most. Mars has potential for a four of a kind, but I rarely play that way. The others like Neptune and Saturn don’t seem likely for big payouts. So, Mercury sounds like the best choice!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
