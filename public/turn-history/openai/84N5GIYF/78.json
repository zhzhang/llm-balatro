{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI'm in the shop without cards for shopping, with only a few options left: reroll, round_select, or use Pluto. I've got $8, and rerolls cost $4 because of a surplus. Rerolling once or twice sounds feasible. We have two ancient jokers in diamonds, which is powerful for a potential diamond flush. Scholar helps with aces, and Cloud 9 offers money. I might want a more effective joker than Cloud 9 or Scholar, but financial gain is good. Pluto is there for later if needed.\n**Analyzing consumable options**\n\nI see that my consumable slot has space for only one item. Rerolling could help me find a planet for a flush, a pair, or a joker. The planet merchant seems to pop up more often, which is nice. With $8, if I reroll twice, I'd be out of funds, hurting my interest rate or future purchases. The shop is currently empty since I bought Scholar, so I might want to reroll to see new cards. Rerolling once while keeping $4 seems wise to maintain some interest at the end of the round.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nIf I don’t reroll, I'd keep my $8 and earn $1 interest at the end of the next round since I’ll have at least $5. I already have a strong scoring setup with a pair worth 10,000. At ante 4, it might need around 20,000, but with two Ancient jokers, I should scale effectively. \n\nGoing for round_select to save money sounds optimal. However, the empty shop might mean missing chances for improvements. Still, I have a strong loadout. Rerolling could yield valuable planet cards, enhancing my flush or pair, which could provide extra chips and multipliers.\n**Considering reroll options**\n\nIf I reroll once and find good planets, I could buy one and still have some cash left. I’m at max jokers, but the shop might have tarot or planet consumables that fit into my slots. Although we can't see the shop cards right now, a reroll would reveal them. \n\nSo, it makes sense to choose to reroll now; it costs $4, leaving me with $4, a risk for potential gain. If the cards turn out worthless, I can still opt for round_select later without spending more. However, I might lose some interest, though $4 isn't a big deal. At ante 4, having power is more crucial than just cash.\n**Deciding to reroll**\n\nOkay, with Cloud9 generating $4 per round as long as I reach 9 count, I can recover financially. That cushion makes it feel safer to reroll. I think rerolling the shop is a good option now. It could open up new possibilities, and since I have some financial backup, it feels like a manageable risk. Let's go ahead with the reroll_shop!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
