{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card order in gameplay**\n\nI'm thinking about how to arrange jokers before playing to maximize triggers. The order of jokers matters for specific categories, and I noticed that Scholar and Ancient as \"on scored\" triggers can influence outcomes based on their positioning. Currently, the order is Scholar, Ancient, Ancient, Hanging Chad, Splash — and my strategy involves understanding how each card's effect interacts. If Scholar goes first, it could significantly boost chips and multipliers, which is crucial for the game!\n**Sorting jokers for optimal scoring**\n\nI’m considering the effects of card order, especially with Scholar needing to be placed before Ancient for maximum benefit. If Scholar adds +4 after the xmult, it becomes less effective. I'm not entirely certain about Hanging Chad's retriggering ability, but it seems to activate after the scored jokers. It might be retriggering after that phase, so its positioning matters less since there's only one. Splash appears independent too, but I need to remember that the Ace of Hearts should be played first for Chad's retrigger to work correctly.\n**Deciding on round actions**\n\nI'm planning my next move, focusing on the need to play the round. I might want to provide an intended hand type, possibly a pair or flush, but I’m not completely sure yet. For chips, I estimate I should exceed 22,000. Should I provide a null response? It seems like I just need to indicate the action to play the round. I can't decide the exact hand type right now, so I’ll simply proceed with the action to play the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
