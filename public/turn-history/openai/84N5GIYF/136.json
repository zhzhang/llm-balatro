{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI'm considering my options for the big game. I can either go for a $4 reward and then shop, or skip to get a special pack but face the boss with no resources. It seems better to play big for the reward to help buy tarot or joker items for the boss. My build looks strong with double ancient hearts and Tribe, but I need hearts for the flush to maximize my multiplier. If I hit a full heart flush, one hand might be enough!\n**Considering suit changes**\n\nThe suit changes at the end of each round, but since I've skipped the small game, the suit hasn’t changed yet. Skipping doesn't count as playing a round, which means I still have hearts, good news! If I play big, the suit will change randomly after the round, which could hurt my chances against the boss. However, I need money. Maybe I should skip big, keep the hearts for the boss, and then get a mega celestial pack after. This could be a strategic move!\n**Assessing risk and rewards**\n\nI'm considering whether skipping the big game could help me with ante 8. The risk is that I won't earn money, but the boss rewards $5 plus potential earnings from remaining hands. I think I can beat the boss with a hearts flush, which seems strong. Skipping big might set me up better for that and for the mega celestial pack. Sure, I’d miss out on the $4 reward, but I already have good jokers, and the potential extra chips from the boss could be worth it!\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI'm planning to go up against the boss using hearts, which feels like a solid strategy. So I'm choosing to skip the round to set this up. However, it's crucial to ensure that I can't skip the boss fight itself. I’ll also pick up the tag while I’m at it since that could be beneficial. It seems like this plan is shaping up nicely!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
