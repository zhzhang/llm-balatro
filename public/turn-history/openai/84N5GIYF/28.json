{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI'm considering how the Invisible Joker duplicates after two rounds, which makes for an interesting strategy. Since it’s free, I can hold onto it until a good moment to sell for a duplicate random joker. To optimize, I’ll focus on selling weaker jokers first. But I'll have to watch out for how ice cream decays. I should open both the Jumbo Arcana pack and the standard pack since they could give me beneficial cards!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI think buying jokers first is a no-brainer since they won't significantly change my state. I'm pondering the order of my purchases, and I decide that it doesn't really matter much. I’ll go ahead and buy Hanging Chad first to make sure I don’t miss out on any options if the booster ends up requiring a choice later. So, I’ll stick with that plan and buy Hanging Chad.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
