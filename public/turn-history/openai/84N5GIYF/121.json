{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop purchases**\n\nI’m at the shop with $8, and it seems I don't have any negative tags now. The 8 Ball negative edition is free and gives me a +1 joker slot, so it’s a no-brainer to buy that! The Abstract Joker costs $4 and provides a +3 multiplier per joker. If I buy both, I'll still have $4 left. Plus, I might consider a booster pack or a reroll for 1 dollar. Overall, I think these purchases are beneficial!\n**Considering boss strategies and purchases**\n\nThe next boss is debuffed by All Hearts, which isn’t a big deal since I focus on clubs and spades. My Ancient suit changed to Clubs, so I want club cards to maximize the x1.5 bonus from them. Building a club-heavy deck is important. The Celestial pack can help improve my pair and provide Mercury for leveling, but it costs $6. I can’t afford both the Abstract and Celestial packs, so I need to decide if Celestial is worth it over the Abstract, which adds a significant multiplier.\n**Assessing multipliers and purchases**\n\nI start with a base multiplier of 7 for pairs, but with ancients, I can multiply that. Adding +18 would significantly boost my multiplier. The Celestial pack might raise my pair level and chips, but not as much as the +18 from Abstract. Leveling my pair from 6 to 7 could give an extra +1 multiplier and a few more chips, but still seems less valuable. Given that the Abstract scales with the negative 8 Ball bonus, I’ll buy the 8 Ball first, then the Abstract. With $4 remaining, I could reroll for better synergies.\n**Weighing purchasing decisions**\n\nI’m considering whether to save my money for the next shop or spend it now, especially since interest and rewards come into play at the end of the next round. Facing a boss needing 40,000 is a challenge, but we’re strong. I might want to use Chariot for a steel card later, but that requires a target in hand during the round. Selling Splash could be tempting, but it’s essential for multiplying cards. The 8 Ball gives me extra joker slots, which is beneficial despite its negative edition status, adding some complexity I need to keep track of!\n**Deciding on card purchases and strategy**\n\nI’m sorting through the effects of the negative edition on the joker, which provides an extra joker slot without counting toward the limit. The 8 Ball adds a +1 joker slot too, so I should buy it first to increase my slots before getting Abstract. After that, I’ll figure out the order for scoring jokers. It’s crucial to position Scholar before Ancients for maximum multipliers. I’ll focus on buying the 8 Ball first, since it seems necessary to unlock the additional slot and enhance my strategy!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
