{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m in a shop after beating a boss with $11, owning only a Drunkard card. I need to build for the long run. The shop offers Ice Cream, which gives +100 chips but decreases by 5 for each hand played. There's also an Ancient Joker that multiplies the value of cards in the current suit by 1.5. It could be powerful, but I'm unsure about focusing on different suits each round. Can I adapt my deck? Ice Cream is reliable early, but I'm not sure how to balance both items.\n**Choosing the best long-term strategy**\n\nI'm weighing my options, and the Ancient Joker impresses me with its multiplicative scaling potential. It triggers for played cards of the current suit, stacking at x1.5. If I get a flush of five cards, the multiplier could be massive—over 30! Even if I only play three cards, it still boosts me to 3.375. Buying the Ancient Joker for $8 leaves me with $3. I can't afford a Standard Pack or Jumbo Buffoon, so it looks like I'll stick with the Joker and then select a round with my remaining funds.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
