{"reasoning":"**Calculating flush strategies**\n\nI’m considering how to achieve a flush. With Sun's ability to convert up to three cards to hearts, I can guarantee a flush if I have two hearts in hand. The Tribe bonus gives double points for a flush, which is significant. The Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card, leading to a potential multiplier effect. With Ancient Jokers, each heart could give up to x2.25. It seems I can reach an impressive x11.39 multiplier from the ancients!\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nSplash allows all played cards to score, which is useful, but it might be redundant if we’re always playing a flush since all five cards already count. Yet, sometimes I won't have a flush, and the Tribe prefers it anyway. For ante 8 boss, we need powerful scores, and strong scaling helps us achieve this. Spare Trousers gives a consistent x1.5 multiplier, while the polychrome edition offers additional multipliers. The Joker card provides scaling bonuses based on specific conditions. I need to keep this all in mind!\n**Analyzing the joker’s potential**\n\nThe Joker provides a flat x1.5 multiplier and gains an extra +2 multiplier each time I play a two pair. The polychrome version adds another x1.5, making it potentially x2.25 total, which is significant! I might consider replacing Splash or Tribe with it. Tribe gives x2 if I have a flush, but Splash may be unnecessary since all cards contribute in a flush. I think dropping Splash to add Spare could be a good move for maximizing my score!\n**Considering card strategies**\n\nIn non-flush hands, only my best hand cards score, but I'm aiming for a flush with Tribe and ancients, so that's fine. Hanging Chad requires the first played card in scoring, even with a flush. I should sell Splash for $1 and buy Spare Trousers for free.\n\nThat leaves me with $13, and I’m considering a Walkie Talkie for $4, which provides chips and +4 multiplier per 10 or 4 scored. However, I’d need to replace another card to fit it in. Given that Tribe gives x2 on flushes, Walkie isn’t strong enough, so I think I’ll skip it. Plus, I could buy an Arcana pack to enhance my deck with valuable tarots!\n**Evaluating card purchases and strategies**\n\nI’m considering whether to buy the Arcana pack for potential powerful tarots like The Lovers or The Sun, but I might need high scores for the ante 8 boss. I can score 165k with three of a kind, and Spare could boost that to 370k. However, Arcana cards must be used immediately, and some require targeting hand cards, which complicates things since I can't see my hand during shop phase. \n\nI think it’s best to focus first on selling Splash, then buying Spare Trousers to strengthen my hand. After that, I can evaluate whether to pursue other options.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
