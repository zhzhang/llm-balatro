{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m in a situation where I have $0, and we're considering selling something for money. However, I might hold off and proceed to round selection instead. I wonder if I should rearrange the jokers to maximize their effects? With Splash, each played card matters for scoring, which is even more significant with Ancient. Each card of a suit gives x1.5 on score, and I need to think about the order of triggers for the best result. It's a bit complex!\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm thinking about how the order of scored jokers might matter, especially with the +mult. It appears that Abstract operates independently from scoring. So, the +mult for each joker applies in a separate phase after scoring, and it's not included in the on-scored phase. Splash modifies scoring participation but isn't triggered. Ancient, on the other hand, affects on scoring. Hanging Chad seems to retrigger the first played card for two additional scoring occurrences, and I need to consider how jokers interact during scoring. It's quite a puzzle!\n**Deciding joker placement**\n\nThe prompt mentions that retriggers happen after scored, and I see that Hanging Chad should be placed leftmost among retriggering jokers to trigger the first card early. However, since we only have Chad, the order isn't crucial. Ancient's order could matter if there were more scoring variables, but we only have Ancient and 8 Ball. The 8 Ball creates tarot but doesn't affect scoring, so its position isn't vital. I could still place Hanging Chad earlier in activation, but it seems irrelevant given the current situation.\n**Considering card strategy**\n\nI realize that for independent jokers, the order would matter if there were multiple multipliers, but since only Abstract adds a +18 multiplier, the order is irrelevant. I'm wondering if I should sell The Chariot consumable for $1. It could help with rerolls, but I’d lose the valuable steel enhancement that boosts the multiplier by x1.5. Although I don't have deck context, I think keeping it makes sense. Selling Splash for $1 could be tempting, but it plays a critical role in scoring. I think I'd better hold onto it!\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI’m realizing that without Splash, only the cards in my final hand will score, which could drastically decrease the xmult if I’m only getting points from two cards. So I should definitely keep Splash. Selling Hanging Chad for $2 seems tempting, but it's valuable for retriggering multipliers. Abstract is also worth keeping since it adds a +18 mult. As for the next round, it looks like I’m at Ante 6, Round 11. But the rounds seem a bit confusing. Whatever it is, I’ll proceed with the round selection!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
