{"reasoning":"**Analyzing deck strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how the spade suit is currently active on the Ancient deck, but there are limited spades. Consistent triggers are needed, and maybe the arcana pack could convert tarot to make spades wild. The banner gives +30 chips for each discard left; I believe we have two discards now. Theoretically, it could yield a significant number of chips if circumstances allowed, but we usually end up using our discards for assembling hands. Still, we've been scoring huge chips lately, so maybe a voucher isn't necessary.\n**Evaluating ante and scoring factors**\n\nI'm uncertain about the ante being around 350k for the eight small. Previously, I managed to score 2M with flush hearts due to double ancient hearts synergy, but now that spades are the focus, it might drastically cut the multiplier. Tribe x2 applies to any flush, and Splash counts all cards, so maybe playing flush hearts could still yield significant gains? However, since ancient triggers only apply to spades now, we'll need to reassess without those bonuses. Overall, I’m not quite sure how this will play out.\n**Deciding on spade flush strategy**\n\nI'm considering the idea of making a spade flush by converting using tarots, so the Arcana pack might be my best bet for cards like The World for spades and The Moon for clubs. However, the Sun only converts to Hearts, which isn't helpful right now. The suit changes at the end of each round, so for ante 8 with the small blind, the current suit is spades. But since changing is random, I’m wondering if focusing too much on spades might backfire if the suit changes unexpectedly.\n**Weighing purchase options**\n\nConverting to spades might not hurt much since I can still make a flush. I'm considering the best purchase, and the Wasteful voucher seems appealing since it provides an extra discard, helping me search for the flush suit each round without being tied to a specific suit. It also benefits the last ante. While the cost uses all my funds, I can reroll later with interest from rounds, though I may not get another chance after the final boss. There are multiple shops left, so spending now could be okay. Alternatively, I could buy the Arcana pack for tarot cards, but I can't do both. The Arcana pack might yield strong cards like The World or Justice, but it's still a risk.\n**Deciding on purchase strategy**\n\nSince my goal is to clear the final ante reliably, I'm leaning towards buying the Wasteful voucher. The extra discard will provide me with consistent options and help reduce the risk of a bad draw. Plus, I already have a strong scoring setup, so this should enhance my chances. Now, I’ll move forward with this decision and prepare the necessary action in JSON format. This feels like a good approach!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
