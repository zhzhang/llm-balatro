{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop options**\n\nI’m considering what we have with the Empress tarot selection, where we targeted 9 spades and 7 diamonds, resulting in Mult cards. It’s exciting since the shop has Green and Wrathful Jokers, but I need to decide whether to buy or sell. We're building with dual Ancients and others while targeting diamonds, though we’ll switch suits at the end of the round. Green Joker could be strong if we minimize discards, and Wrathful boosts our score with spades.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm realizing that with Chad retriggering the first played card twice, the first scored card gets its effects three times, which is fantastic if it's a diamond Mult card. This could maximize chip collection. I’m also considering keeping Cloud9 for its $4 per round since we have $18, but I might need to score more. As we approach round six, I need to strategize for upcoming blinds and assess which joker to replace for better multipliers.\n**Weighing joker options**\n\nI'm assessing the value of the Wrathful and Green Jokers. Wrathful adds multipliers per spade, but might be inconsistent if Ancient's suit isn’t spade, while Green scales up no matter the suit. We're mid-run and could benefit from playing several hands per blind to get +20-30 multipliers. I’m considering whether to drop Odd Todd or Cloud9, leaning toward Odd Todd since it synergizes with Chad. However, dropping Odd Todd might limit my chip gains from odd plays.\n**Assessing multiplier strategies**\n\nThe Green Joker could provide a solid +20 multiplier, which combined with the Ancient multipliers might really boost my score. Meanwhile, Wrathful adds multipliers per spade, plus it retriggers with each spade played. If I get a spade flush, I can see a +15 multiplier, plus retrigger bonuses that can really add up! However, if Ancient's suit changes, the synergy with Wrathful could weaken. Green Joker is reliable in any situation. I’m contemplating the potential of both jokers, but I need to manage my slots effectively.\n**Deciding on joker strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about selling Cloud9 and OddTodd to buy Green and Wrathful jokers, but that would cost me my chip income. Still, jokers could significantly increase my scores. I have $18 plus the income from Cloud9, which might be enough for rerolls. Spending too much could be risky. I realize we're at the end of Round 6, and the Ancient suit will change after the next blind. I decide to sell OddTodd to buy Green, as it fits my current strategy. Let's go ahead and sell OddTodd!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
