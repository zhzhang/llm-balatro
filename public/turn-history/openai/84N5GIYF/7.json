{"reasoning":"**Weighing purchase options**\n\nI need to decide on purchases in the shop with $6. My choices are a loyalty card for $5, a celestial pack for $4, or saving the money. The loyalty card triggers a x4 multiplier every 6 hands, which could come into play soon. I’ve already played 2 hands, so I’ll need to play 5 more for that to trigger. But spending $5 on the loyalty card means I miss out on the celestial pack, which might be better for leveling.\n**Evaluating upgrades and purchases**\n\nI'm considering the celestial pack, which may provide significant upgrades for my flush with a base score of 35 and potential multipliers. Upgrading would increase chips and multipliers but I'm not sure about the exact amounts. The loyalty card offers a big x4 multiplier every 6th hand, which could help in winning with fewer hands. I’m leaning towards the celestial pack for consistent benefits, but since I have $6, I can’t buy both. Maybe buying the loyalty card now and using the Drunkard to help make flushes is a solid plan.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nThe Ante1 boss isn't too tough, so it seems like a safe investment. I think I'll go for the celestial pack since it provides consistent scaling, especially since I've already used the flush. I'm a bit uncertain about the exact options in the pack. Even if I don’t get Jupiter, I might end up with Saturn for a straight, but that might not align with my strategy. Permanent planet upgrades are definitely a plus, so I’ll purchase the celestial pack now.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
