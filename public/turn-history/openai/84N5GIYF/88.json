{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot card options**\n\nI'm currently selecting a tarot pack and considering my options: The Empress, The Sun, and Strength. Since I have heart-suit synergy and two Ancient Jokers contributing multiplicatively, I realize that converting cards to hearts is incredibly powerful! More hearts increase my score significantly. Given this, The Sun, which allows me to convert up to three cards into hearts, seems like the best choice. Now, I need to determine which cards to convert from my hand: 9 of Spades, 7 of Spades, Q of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, or 9 of Diamonds.\n**Confirming card selection**\n\nI already have some strong hearts: Ace, Jack, and 7. I'm aiming to convert high-value non-heart cards to maximize my score and enhance my Ancient Jokers. The 9 of Spades is great because it triggers multipliers, and the 9 of Diamonds and Q of Clubs are also valuable choices. I think I’ll convert the 9 of Spades, Queen of Clubs, and 9 of Diamonds for better flush possibility. I'll select The Sun and confirm the command as 2, 1, 6, and 8. Let’s go for it!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,6,8]"}
