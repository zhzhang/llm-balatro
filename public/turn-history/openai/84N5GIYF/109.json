{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot choices**\n\nI'm looking at tarot choices from the Arcana pack: Justice, World, and Empress. Since I want to avoid increasing spades and The World carries that risk, it's a bad pick. Justice offers a Glass card with a multiplier, which is useful. The Empress generates two Multipliers, each worth +4, which seems safer and more consistent. We also have an Ancient jokers factor to consider for heart cards, enhancing scaling. The Empress combined with hearts could yield significant rewards, especially with Aces.\n**Considering card enhancements**\n\nI'm thinking it might be best to enhance the Ace of Hearts and possibly the King of Hearts. Enhancing the Ace maintains its rank and suit but turns it into a Mult card for a +4 multiplier when scored. This way, it can trigger the Scholar and Ancient enhancements too. Since Hanging Chad retriggers the first card used in scoring multiple times, I'll ensure the Ace of Hearts is played first to maximize this effect. If I enhance the Empress on these Aces, it looks like I could really boost my multipliers!\n**Weighing card strategies**\n\nI see that the Ace of Diamonds doesn't benefit from Ancient, but it can trigger the Scholar. Instead, I could pick the King of Hearts, which would benefit from Ancient. I think I’ll go with the Ace of Hearts and the King of Hearts for better synergy. But I need to be cautious about the Ace of Hearts' bonus; converting it to a Mult card could remove its bonus of +30 chips. Enhancements are exclusive, so it’s tricky. Maybe I should keep the bonus on the Ace and apply Mult to the King and an 8? I'll balance between losing the bonus and maximizing multipliers.\n**Analyzing multipliers and chips**\n\nI’m considering whether to make the Ace of Hearts a Mult card. If I do, chips drop to 11, but I gain a +4 multiplier. With Splash in play, chips from each card become vital, but massive multipliers can outweigh that loss. I wonder if the loss of 30 chips is significant. Since chips get multiplied by the multiplier total, losing those could cut my score.\n\nWith two Ancient jokers, each heart gives a double multiplier effect, translating into a considerable boost. If I play five hearts, the multiplier could skyrocket exponentially!\n**Choosing card enhancements**\n\nI realize that maximizing chips and multipliers is key. The bonus card gives me +30 chips, which multiplies by 57, contributing significantly. A multiplier card may seem less impactful since my base multiplier already starts strong. If I make the first card a heart, I can trigger Ancient jokers, amplifying my score further. It’s vital to play the Ace of Hearts first for maximum benefit with Scholar! Pairing Empress with the King of Hearts and 8 of Hearts seems like a solid strategy to enhance my multipliers without unnecessary risk. So, I’ll select those cards!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,4,5]"}
