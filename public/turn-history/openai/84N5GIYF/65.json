{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI’m realizing that \"suit changes at end of round\" means suits rotate randomly each round. With two Ancients, it's likely they change separately. Traditionally, the Ancient Joker chooses the suit at the start, changing to the next one each round randomly. Both showing diamonds aligns well. In Ante4, having higher blinds means I should consider buying the Green Joker, but that might not be effective since we play few hands and discard often. Wrathful Joker could help, but we need to consider our current slots.\n**Considering game mechanics**\n\nI’m weighing whether to keep Cloud9, since I already have $38, or sell it for future scoring. Odd Todd adds +31 chips for odd ranks, which can be beneficial with cards like Ace/9, especially when using Chad to retrigger. Given the high multiplier, chips become important too. I could also think about buying boosters from the Celestial pack for planet cards. My main hand could be a pair or a flush. I realize now we need to prioritize diamonds to maximize triggers.\n**Strategizing hand options**\n\nI’m thinking it might be best to aim for a pair of diamonds or perhaps a diamond flush. Since the suit changes, I can't rely solely on diamonds, but wild cards can help. Investing in hand levels through planets seems like a solid strategy, and with the voucher for Planet Merchant, I have access to common planets. The Celestial pack at $4 looks like great value. I should prioritize that and aim for a flush, as triggering ancients would really boost my score. If Jupiter is available, I'll definitely grab it!\n**Weighing purchase options**\n\nI’m considering buying the Reroll Surplus voucher for $10 to lower reroll costs. Since I have $38, it seems like a solid long-term investment, especially since it helps find jokers and planets. The savings from the voucher will likely kick in after about five rerolls, which I think I'll exceed. \n\nHowever, I can only make one action at a time. Buying a voucher first is usually the way to go, but I still need to decide the best order between that and any booster for immediate scaling.\n**Deciding purchase order**\n\nI’m thinking it might be better to buy the Celestial pack first to determine if I actually need rerolls. But the voucher doesn't seem to affect current costs. However, buying it will lower the reroll cost to $3, which is great for finding better jokers and planets in this shop. So, I’ll go ahead and buy the voucher first, then proceed with rerolls if necessary, and finally buy the packs. My next action will be to buy the voucher.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
