{"reasoning":"**Clarifying poker strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how to improve the game strategy with Mercury and using two cards, especially when a flush can't be made. Odd Todd gives chips to odd ranks, which might work alongside pairs. Now, whether the boss blind is coming up is key since we're in round 5 of ante 3. I'm confused because each ante has different blinds, and round 5 seems to indicate overall rounds. We finished big blind of ante 3, and it looks like the boss's debuff might affect flushes. Enhancing my flush could help against the boss.\n**Selecting planets for strategy**\n\nI think it’s a good idea to select Jupiter and Mercury. I need to choose them one at a time, starting with Jupiter in position 5. After that selection, the pack should shrink down to 4. But I should remember that once I pick position 5, it disappears and the remaining ones shift. However, the command should still focus on selecting 5 first. So, I’m going to go ahead and select 5 now.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
