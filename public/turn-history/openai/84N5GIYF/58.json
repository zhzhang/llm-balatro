{"reasoning":"**Deciding next shopping action**\n\nI need to decide my next step in the shop. I can buy the Cloud 9 card for $7, and since I already have four jokers, I can still buy it without exceeding the maximum. My funds are at $16, so I can make this purchase. Rerolling isn’t necessary since Cloud 9 has good economics, and I’ll still have money left over. I think the best move is to buy Cloud 9 now, as the shop is limited. Time to output the action in JSON!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
