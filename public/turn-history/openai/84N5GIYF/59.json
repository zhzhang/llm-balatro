{"reasoning":"**Deciding on rerolling options**\n\nI'm in a shop without any cards, boosters, or vouchers. My only choices are to reroll or select a round. I have $9, and rerolling costs $5. Should I go for it? There's a boss coming up in Ante 3, which makes this more interesting. Round 5 hints at possible boss blinds, but I need to consider my options carefully before making a decision.\n**Assessing reroll options before boss fight**\n\nI have an Investment tag that gives me $25 after defeating the boss blind. I need to make sure I can win. Currently, I have two Ancient jokers along with Chad, Odd Todd, and Cloud 9. My scoring seems strong since I earlier had a 12k flush, but the boss blind might change things. Rerolling could help me find a strong joker or planet. Spending $5 now seems sensible because I'll gain enough afterward. But if the reroll reveals a costly card, buying might be an issue. I should consider my options carefully!\n**Evaluating joker selling and rerolling strategy**\n\nI can sell jokers for cash: $4 for Ancient, $2 each for Chad and Odd Todd, and $3 for Cloud 9. While selling is tempting, I might prefer to keep them. If I find a better joker, I could swap out Chad or Odd Todd. Should I reroll at least once with my remaining money? The interest will give me $1 for my $9, but spending $5 to reroll could reduce that. Big rewards are expected after defeating the boss, so it might be worth the risk. Going into the boss fight without upgrades feels risky, especially if the boss counters my flush!\n**Analyzing card strategies for the boss fight**\n\nIt seems the current suit is hearts, and I think it hasn't updated yet. For the boss, managing a hearts flush could be tricky, but I might play heart cards to get multipliers. With two Ancient jokers, each heart card contributes x1.5, doubling up to x2.25 total. That's a strong advantage! I could make my first card a high or odd-ranking heart to maximize chips. Rerolling is definitely worth considering, even without booster packs. I'll go ahead and reroll once at least; if I don't find anything useful, I'll select a round instead.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
