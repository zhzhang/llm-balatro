{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card game mechanics**\n\nI’m reviewing how the retrigger effect from Hanging Chad interacts with Odd Todd’s scoring. The order of applying chips, enhancements, and seals is crucial. For an odd heart card, I need to consider whether the Ancient Jokers apply before or after Odd Todd. Ancient gives a multiplier, while Odd Todd offers additional chips. The order of this affects the final multiplier, but not the chips. It seems multipliers can be commutative, which is important to keep track of!\n**Clarifying game mechanics**\n\nI’m pondering the order of multipliers and whether it matters. Since only Ancient provides a multiplier and there's no additional multiplier, the order is irrelevant. Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card, activating after scoring. Chad also triggers based on that initial card used in scoring, repeating the scoring process twice. I'll consider repositioning Chad to the leftmost position since retriggering jokers apply left-to-right. With the Ancient suit changing at the round's end, I’ll move on to round selection and prepare the JSON response.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
