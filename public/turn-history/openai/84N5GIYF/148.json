{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI’m figuring out my next steps in the game after buying a voucher, which feels wasteful since I can't afford anything else. I could sell the Sun for $1 to reroll, but I’m questioning if that’s a good idea, especially since I might need the Sun later. We're in round 13, and I should prepare for the final boss at ante 8, requiring careful adjustments to my build. It's tricky balancing risks!\n**Planning for round 13**\n\nWe're in round 13 after defeating the ante 7 boss, and the small blind at ante 8 is approaching. I think the Sun could be useful if Ancient changes suits to hearts after this round, but right now, they’re set to spades. Using the Sun at this point seems irrelevant. However, I might consider selling a joker to buy a Banner for $5. The Banner would give +30 chips for each remaining discard, which could be valuable. But I need to think carefully!\n**Evaluating Banner's value**\n\nI just realized that each round starts with three discards, plus one from Wasteful, giving us four. The Banner could add 120 chips if we don't use any discards, which is significant when considering the multipliers from ancients and tribe. However, not discarding could limit our chances for synergy. If I use two discards, I get an extra 60 chips instead. To buy the Banner for $5, I could sell the Sun and some other items for funds. But is the Banner really worth it? Hm.\n**Evaluating the scoring engine**\n\nI need to evaluate the current scoring setup. With two Ancient Jokers, each spade played gives a 1.5 multiplier, stacking up to 2.25 for each spade. If I manage to play five spades in a flush, that could mean a whopping multiplier of 57.7! Plus, if I add the Tribe’s x2 bonus for a flush, I'm looking at 115.4 total. \n\nNow, about Hanging Chad—it retriggers the first scoring card two extra times. With Splash, every played card counts, making it super valuable even if I don't achieve a spade flush!\n**Assessing scoring mechanics**\n\nI need to dive into the scoring mechanics. If my first card is a spade, it activates the Ancient multipliers multiple times, resulting in substantial bonuses. Each spade can lead to increasing multipliers based on how often it scores, making the first card crucial. The Tribe multiplier boosts scores significantly if I achieve a flush, which is independent of jokers. \n\nWith my deck only containing six spades, building a flush seems tough, but Splash allows for flexibility in scoring. I should consider my joker arrangements carefully, especially regarding Hanging Chad and the Ancients, to maximize scoring opportunities. Maybe I won't rush into selling my cards just yet, considering potential future shops.\n**Finalizing the decision**\n\nIt looks like I don’t need to make any immediate changes since I have the Sun tarot in consumables. I can’t use it without target hand cards, so it’s best to just keep it for now. Now, I’m ready to proceed to the round selection. I think it's time to craft the JSON for that next step! Let’s get everything organized and ready for the upcoming round.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
