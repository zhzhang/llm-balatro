{"reasoning":"**Analyzing current chips setup**\n\nI'm in a shop with $14, and the only option is Cloud 9 for $7. I noticed I have four nines in my deck. Each round, I earn $4, which is decent for the economy. I need to replace the weakest joker among my current options: two Ancient Jokers, Hanging Chad, Odd Todd, and Ice Cream. Ice Cream gives me +75 chips but loses 5 for each hand played. We've played about 8 or maybe 15 hands, so I should calculate my current chips.\n**Evaluating joker strategies**\n\nI've played a total of 7 hands. Ice Cream gives me a decent bonus of +40 chips. Hanging Chad triggers cards extra times, making it strong alongside Ancient and Odd Todd, which could be essential. Odd Todd adds +31 chips for odd ranks, while Ancient Joker duplicates suit triggers per card. With both Ancients in the same suit (hearts), each qualifying card triggers x2.25 multiplier. So, I think I should keep both Ancients. I might consider selling Ice Cream or Odd Todd. Since I have $14, I can buy Cloud 9 after selling a joker for space.\n**Deciding on joker replacement**\n\nSelling Ice Cream gives me $2, but I need space for better options since I already have $14. I think I'd prefer replacing Ice Cream because it decays, while the Ancient Jokers provide multipliers for scoring. Ice Cream does offer +chips independently, but it doesn't feel essential. On the flip side, Cloud 9 earns $4 each round, which might be useful for rerolls or buying more jokers. Since it's still early in play, I’ll opt to buy Cloud 9. My plan is to sell Ice Cream first, then buy Cloud 9.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
