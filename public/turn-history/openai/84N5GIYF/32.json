{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop items**\n\nI'm in the shop with 19 money left after Temperance. I need to choose between a free Standard Pack, a Hone voucher for 10, or a reroll for 5. The Standard Pack is free, so I should open it first, but the Hone voucher could help long-term by doubling edition spawns. I can afford both Hone and the reroll, but the Standard Pack is free, and it might add a helpful card, though it could also add an unwanted suit. I need to weigh the options carefully!\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about our strategy with the Ancient Joker, which currently aligns with hearts, but it changes suits at the end of each round. Each heart played gives a 1.5x multiplier for scoring, so focusing on hearts might be temporary. We scored a massive flush of 4981.5, likely boosted by the Ancient Joker. Investing in the Hone voucher could help us find better editions and increase our chips or multipliers permanently. With 19 money left, I believe Hone is a wise choice!\n**Planning purchase sequence**\n\nI'm considering whether I should reroll the shop before buying the Hone voucher. The reroll costs 5, but there aren’t any cards available right now; it may add jokers or consumables, which could be useful. If I buy the Hone now, it'll boost the chances of getting better editions later on, which seems promising. I think the plan should be to open the free Standard Pack first, pick a card, then buy the Hone voucher, and possibly reroll next. Let's start by opening the Standard Pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
