{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop strategy**\n\nI'm at the shop with $14 to spend. I have a strong setup with Scholar and 2 Ancient Clubs, plus Hanging Chad and Splash. Playing lots of cards is great; with Splash, all played cards score. Having 2 Ancients gives me a multiplier of x2.25 for each club, so I want to load my deck with clubs and Aces. I’m considering various items in the shop, like packs and reroll options for improving my strategy. Reroll costs could also help me search for specific cards, which is really exciting!\n**Improving hand strategy**\n\nIn my last hand, a pair earned 36k chips, so that's a strong position. I need to reach an ante of 8 eventually, and scaling is important. Upgrading both the pair and three-of-a-kind will boost my chips and multiplier. Mercury improves my Pair of Aces, giving +15 chips and +1 multiplier with a cheap cost of $3, which seems like a great value! Venus also enhances my three-of-a-kind by +20 chips and +2 multipliers. I can afford both planets for $6, leaving me with $8 to work with!\n**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI'm considering buying the Standard pack for $4, which could add a club Ace, but it’s random. The Jumbo Spectral pack might offer powerful effects like Immolate or Wraith, but that feels risky. There's also the Voucher Reroll Glut for $10, which could be great for rolling for clubs or jokers, especially since rerolls would only cost $1 after discounts. With $8 left after buying planets, I can’t buy the voucher alongside others, but maybe it holds more value compared to the other packs?\n**Considering options for upgrades**\n\nI'm weighing whether to buy the voucher for $10 and still grab one planet, since planets provide immediate power. The reroll could help find better jokers later, but I don't have extra space right now. I could sell Splash if I find something better, but it's currently a key part of my synergy with Ancient. I could replace it with something like Blueprint or Brainstorm, though they’re rare. Rerolls at $3 are affordable, so that’s an option. I also need to think about the order of my jokers, as effects trigger left-to-right.\n**Strategizing purchases and joker order**\n\nI’m thinking about how Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card, ideally a club Ace, and how Splash affects scoring. The order of jokers matters, especially with Ancient and Scholar. To maximize multipliers, I want Scholar before Ancient since Scholar adds +4 to the multiplier, which then gets multiplied by Ancient. In the shop, I can prioritize buying Mercury and Venus as consumable planets for immediate power, then consider the voucher Reroll Glut for long-term use. With $8 left, I need to decide whether to go for a standard pack or Jumbo Spectral pack for deck enhancements. I might lean towards the voucher for long-term benefits!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm looking at Mercury, which gives +15 chips and +1 multiplier, and Venus, offering +20 chips and +2 multiplier. We typically rely on pairs, using them effectively in the boss fight. Mercury feels consistent since it's our main hand type, but Venus offers a bigger improvement per cost. I think it’s better to buy the voucher Reroll Glut now to lower reroll costs to $1. With the remaining funds, I’d choose to buy Venus next. So, I should take the action to buy the voucher first!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
