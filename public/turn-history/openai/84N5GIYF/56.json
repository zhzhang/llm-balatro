{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop strategies**\n\nI'm considering purchasing Cloud 9 after beating the boss, but then I wonder about the timing for going to the next blind. Having cash right now doesn’t impact scoring. Money could let us reroll or buy items in the next shop. After using Temperance, I realize we can still shop, especially since the tarot pack is in the store. If we get $14 with Temperance, I might buy Cloud 9 for $7. But we might still access Cloud 9 after using the pack. I need to think more about the deck composition.\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI've got four 9s in play, which is solid since Cloud 9 will give $4 per round at the end. We’ll also have the Investment tag soon, giving $25, so our economy should be fine. I’m considering buying jokers like Cloud 9 and getting rerolls too. The Wheel of Fortune has a 25% chance to add a random joker edition, which could boost our scoring significantly. Even if it fails, it might not hurt us, but I'll weigh the risks, especially with an impending boss fight.\n**Assessing Ancient's suit strategy**\n\nI'm considering whether the Ancient's suit requirement could change from hearts, which might impact our strategy. For flushes, we have a strong hand level of 2, and manipulating suits could make achieving a flush easier. The Ancient pays a multiplier of x1.5 for cards of the chosen suit, currently hearts. If we could convert cards to hearts, that would be ideal. But since we're already in round 5 and just finished with the big blind, the suit likely changed after that round. I need to keep track of that for our strategy!\n**Preparing for the boss fight**\n\nAs we're heading into the boss fight, I'm realizing that the suit might not be hearts anymore, but the description notes that the heart suit gives a x1.5 multiplier. So, if hearts is currently active, that’s great news! However, the Moon to clubs won't help us. I’m thinking about using the Tower stone card to add 50 chips without worrying about rank or suit, which could significantly boost our score. Utilizing the Devil gold card could also give us $3 if we keep it until the end, but our main focus should be maximizing Tower’s power during the immediate boss confrontation.\n**Strategizing with cards and economy**\n\nI'm diving into whether the Hanging Chad can retrigger cards, which is great since each High Card in the hand boosts chips with the stone adding 50 per scoring. However, since the stone has no rank or suit, it might not give us the benefits from Odd Todd or the Ancient multiplier. I'm realizing that these stone cards will still score chips when played, even if they don't contribute to hand formation.  \n\nGiven my earlier flush score, I think we could easily clear the boss ante, especially with heart multipliers. The Wheel of Fortune's chance of adding polychrome or holographic features is tempting but risky. Should I take Temperance for some cash? Cloud 9 might help our economy, but I'd need to consider selling a joker like Ice Cream to make space. That decision requires careful thought!\n**Considering card strategy and economy**\n\nI think it's a good idea to go for Cloud 9 since it boosts our economy and doesn’t rely on specific plays, while Ice Cream might eventually lose value. With two Ancients and Odd Todd, we have decent scoring, even without Ice Cream, which adds +75 chips. However, the reduction of Ice Cream's value over played hands is concerning. It seems to subtract 5 chips for each hand played, so maybe its value is lower than +75 now.  \n\nI believe selecting Temperance is the best move since it guarantees us $14, which we can use in the shop to make further decisions. I'll choose Temperance now, and hopefully, that can set us up nicely!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
