{"reasoning":"**Deciding on SHOP strategy**\n\nI’m considering our next move in SHOP, particularly whether to buy the Scholar. It seems like a good choice since it’s cheap and enhances chips/multipliers when Aces are played. However, I’m not entirely sure about the deck configuration of Aces. The Scholar’s ability suggests it could yield a significant bonus, especially with the Ancient enhancements. I need to prioritize how we play these cards, especially regarding the Ancient Jokers and Scholar interactions. It’s a bit complex!\n**Optimizing card order in SHOP**\n\nI’m analyzing the use of the Ancient Joker and how it interacts with the Scholar. The Ancient Joker multiplies each played card of a specific suit by x1.5 during scoring, and the order of jokers is crucial. To maximize our multipliers, we should play Scholar first for additive benefits, followed by the Ancient Jokers for multiplicative effects. However, I need to clarify that the Hanging Chad retriggers from the first played card during scoring, which might place it differently in our sequence. It’s all about the strategy!\n**Clarifying joker mechanics**\n\nI’m working through how the retriggering jokers interact during scoring. The Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card used in scoring two extra times, and I believe it fits into the category of retriggering after the score. The order of jokers matters, especially regarding when the Ancient triggers during scoring. However, since Chad is a retriggering joker, its placement among other jokers doesn’t impact the outcome. So, I think the best order is Scholar, Ancient, Ancient, Hanging Chad, and finally Cloud 9.\n**Planning immediate actions**\n\nI need to take immediate action and buy the Scholar for $4 since we have $12. We also have the planets Pluto and Mercury to consider using. The planets can help level up hand types, and we might need their effects before facing the boss, but I don't see a reason to hold onto them for selling. Using Mercury now could strengthen our Pair, moving it to level 3, which adds +1 multiplier and +15 chips. This could be a strong play!\n**Finalizing shop actions**\n\nI need to decide whether to buy the Scholar now or hold onto my resources for a potential boss that might debuff our High Card. I think buying the Scholar is the better choice right now, and after that, I can choose to use either Mercury or Pluto. Each response from my assistant counts as one action, so I’ll make sure to buy the Scholar while ensuring the “Shop Cards” only contains it. That will occupy one of our joker slots, leaving us with room for one more. Time to respond with \"buy_card 1\" and format the Action JSON!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
