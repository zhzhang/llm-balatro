{"reasoning":"**Calculating discard strategies**\n\nI can discard up to 5 cards, so if I discard 4 non-diamonds, I'll draw 4 new ones, aiming for diamonds. There are 9 diamonds left out of 34 cards. The probability of not drawing a diamond in 4 attempts is about 27.2%, which means I have a 72.8% chance of getting at least one diamond. I can discard Kings and some lower cards, keeping the diamonds. If I still don’t get one, I can try to discard again for a better chance!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4]"}
