{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tag strategies**\n\nI’m considering whether I can skip each blind tag while still playing the boss. Skipping small gives me Investment, while skipping big gets me Handy. Could I play small and skip big at the same time? It looks like skipping small means losing $3 but gaining $25 later if I beat the boss, which I anticipate I will. Although there's a delay in getting duplicates, the $25 could be quite useful. Ultimately, I think I should skip small for the Investment tag.\n**Clarifying tag effects**\n\nI’m trying to figure out how the tag effects work when I skip. It sounds like the Handy tag might give immediate cash upon acquisition, earning $1 for each played hand during the run, totaling $6. But I’m unsure if tags trigger rewards right away or at a later event, such as after defeating a boss. It’s likely I receive the money immediately when I get the tag. I think I remember that about Handy, but I want to confirm.\n**Assessing tag strategies**\n\nIf I skip big, I could get $6 immediately, which isn't too bad. But skipping also means losing the shop after the big play. Since skipping small already leaves me without a shop, I won't have one until after the boss fight, and I won't progress Invisible either, which seems detrimental. My plan is to skip small for Investment, then play big to beat it and access the shop before the boss. This way, I can duplicate before the boss fight, which sounds good!\n**Weighing options for Invisible**\n\nIf I decide to play small, that will get Invisible to 2/2 immediately and allow duplication before going big, which might be better. But then I wonder if that's worth missing out on Investment, especially since $25 is quite significant. The good news is that I can still duplicate after going big, so I think skipping small makes more sense. When I do that, I’ll stay blind-select at big and choose skip_round as my next action. I’ll ensure I can’t skip the boss and format the output as JSON.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
