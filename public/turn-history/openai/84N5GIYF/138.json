{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nI'm working through some game mechanics related to card values and levels. It seems that the high card base moves from 25 chips at a multiplier of 3 to 35 chips at a new multiplier of 4. For Mars, a four of a kind jumps significantly from level 2 to 3 with better chip values. I wonder if it's worth picking certain card combinations based on their potential value, particularly focusing on higher payoffs. Ultimately, it’s about maximizing expected value.\n**Assessing hand probabilities**\n\nI'm evaluating the probabilities for making various hands in the game. A high card is always possible, but it’s a fallback option. I think we can assume having at least a pair is likely since picking two of the same rank is manageable. Three of a kind is moderate in probability, while four of a kind is low. With the Mars option, if we can manage a four of a kind, it could be extremely valuable, especially with high base chips and a multiplier. But it's definitely a rare occurrence!\n**Evaluating card choices**\n\nI'm considering picking Pluto to boost our base multiplier and chips, especially for hands where we don't make pairs, trips, or flushes. However, since we're at pair level 7, it’s likely we'll always have a pair from an 8-card hand. The odds of drawing no pair at all from a standard deck seem to be around 0.1, meaning the probability of having at least one pair is about 0.95. It looks like options like full house or four of a kind are quite rare, making Pluto less valuable.\n**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI'm considering that Mars might offer the best potential for a big win, even if it's rare. We need 140k chips to beat the boss, but given that we can already generate over 200k with a pair, I think we have a solid chance if we maintain a hearts flush. Since the suit hasn't changed, we can leverage the ancient suit. With the right cards, scoring each heart can ramp up our multiplier significantly, leading us to potentially hit a substantial total. So, our planet choice isn't crucial; I just need something for the ante!\nI'm thinking that we should focus on strengthening non-flush hands because the ancient suit will change after the boss round. With ante 8, since blinds are higher, we’ll need consistent high scores, even if suits change away from hearts. The ancient suit changes independently, but could differ randomly. Our strategy may need to pivot towards three-of-a-kind or pairs instead of relying on suits. I’m leaning towards choosing Mars to enhance four of a kind since it also contains the higher scoring opportunities. So, let's select Mars!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
