{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchases and strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to reroll for $5, which would leave me with $4. I might get a cheap joker, but the shop is mostly empty besides a voucher. Buying Hone first could influence my future shop appearances and reroll results. Since the voucher likely applies immediately, it might be better to buy it now before rerolling. Alternatively, I could reroll first to check for must-have jokers, but Hone seems like a solid investment for the future.\n**Assessing interest and spending**\n\nI’m weighing whether we risk losing interest if we spend. Interest earns $1 per $5 at the end of a round, but the details on the cap aren’t clear. Spending $10 reduces interest earned from 3 to 1 per round, so that’s a loss of 2. However, improving editions could be beneficial. Given the early ante of 2, Hone is a solid choice for opening boosters. Oh, we actually took steel 4 hearts, not foil 7 spades. My action: buy voucher 1 for Hone.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
