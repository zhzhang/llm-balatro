{"reasoning":"**Deciding on Joker Selection**\n\nI'm in a position where I have to choose between Grim or Wraith from a spectral pack. If I go with Wraith, it creates a random Rare Joker but sets my money to $0, and I currently have $4. My joker slots are maxed out at 6, but I have a negative 8 ball that adds one slot. To make space for a new joker, I'd need to sell one first. I wonder if I can sell a joker now during pack selection. The available commands include sell_joker. Should I sell something like Splash or Hanging Chad?\n**Evaluating Joker Sale Strategy**\n\nI'm trying to figure out my options for selling jokers. If I sell the 8 ball, my max goes down to 5, and I’d need to sell another joker to stay within limits. So, I need to keep the 8 ball while selling another joker to make space for a new one. Maybe I should sell Abstract because it has a +18 multiplier, but it seems crucial. Splash and Hanging Chad are also essential. Perhaps I should consider selling one of the Ancient Jokers instead, but they have significant stacking benefits! Decisions, decisions!\n**Considering Card Replacement Options**\n\nI'm weighing whether it's better to replace a card with a rare one from Wraith, but that's uncertain. Maybe I should choose Grim instead. It can destroy one random card in my hand and add two enhanced Aces. I'm thinking Grim modifies my deck; it says it adds to my hand, but since this is a spectral effect, it likely adds to my deck. This could be strong because Aces are helpful for scoring pairs, which is key for me, even if not based on rank.\n**Weighing Card Risks and Benefits**\n\nI'm considering how the splash effect could give me more cards for scoring, but really, only played cards matter. More Aces isn't a huge advantage. However, the enhanced Aces might be helpful like Steel, Glass, or Lucky. The downside is that Grim could randomly destroy a valuable card in my hand, like the 4♥ Steel card that has a X1.5 multiplier and creates tarot when discarded. Grim has a 1/8 chance to take that away. Wraith is similarly risky, but it might bring game-winning jokers like Blueprint. There's potential for synergy if I swap out Hanging Chad or Splash. However, with the upcoming Ante 7 and my current scoring at 76k, I definitely need to scale up for those higher blinds.\n**Planning for Ante 7 Strategy**\n\nAnte 7 may have higher thresholds around 60-80k, so upgrading my jokers could be essential. Grim modifies the deck but removes a random card, which could be risky. Wraith could provide a powerful rare joker but needs an open slot, requiring me to sell one first. I’m hesitant to part with key jokers like Hanging Chad or Splash due to their synergy. Selling Abstract might be my best option, as its additive multiplier could be less valuable compared to the large bonuses from my Ancients. I believe selling Abstract allows room for a new rare joker from Wraith without significant risk.\n**Analyzing Current Resources**\n\nI have The Chariot consumable, and I've noticed a Steel 4♥ in my hand that has the ability to create tarot when discarded. This means I already have a steel card, probably from earlier plays. Using The Chariot later could create another steel card for me to hold. I'm considering Wraith for a chance to get a rare joker like Blueprint or Brainstorm, which could significantly boost my strategy. So, my action is to sell the Abstract joker while ensuring that this doesn’t reduce my max slots. Let's proceed!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [6]"}
