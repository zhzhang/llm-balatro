{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategies**\n\nI'm considering Cloud 9, which provides +$4 per round with four nines, and that sounds promising in the long run. However, I have five joker slots, and if I buy Odd Todd, I can't get Cloud 9 without selling something. We're looking at Ice Cream, which currently gives me +75 chips but decays over time. While it still provides value, it might be reaching a point where replacing it with Cloud 9 could be beneficial for future purchases. Two ancients might also be unnecessary.\n**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI'm trying to understand how the suits work because both could change at the end of the round. If they change independently, they might both switch to the same suit, which could introduce some flexibility. Right now, they're both Hearts, but that randomness might create opportunities. I'll definitely keep doubling down on the triggers and purchase Odd Todd. Rearranging my jokers is important for maintaining the correct order of triggers. The Ancient cards add valuable multipliers, so I need to consider that when playing. Ice Cream offers independent chips, too!\n**Understanding game triggers**\n\nI'm unpacking how Odd Todd works; it triggers on scored cards and adds chips for odd ranks. Then there's Hanging Chad, which can retrigger the first played card for extra scoring. This is a type of retriggering joker, likely fitting into a certain category. The order of cards matters, as on-scored jokers apply from left to right. After considering purchasing the Mega Celestial pack to upgrade hand types, I'll focus on getting Odd Todd first since it reduces my funds. It seems my best next move is to buy Odd Todd now!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
