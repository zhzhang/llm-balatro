{"reasoning":"**Strategizing for the round**\n\nI'm in the middle of a boss round and need to accumulate 10,000 chips. Right now, I have 4,925 chips and three hands left with no discards. I need at least 5,075 more. I have several jokers to utilize, which can greatly boost my score. Splash indicates that every played card counts in scoring, so I can maximize my hands even if cards aren’t in the main poker hand. I'll aim to play my best five cards to reach my scoring goals.\n**Analyzing scoring with hearts**\n\nI'm focusing on how hearts will score in this round. Since the last hand included hearts, I assume hearts will still apply. Each heart card gives a multiplier of x1.5, resulting in x2.25 when scored. With the Hanging Chad, if the first scoring card is a heart (like A♥), it can retrigger, applying the Ancient jokers multiplier as well. Each time A♥ is scored, it can potentially score multiple times and provide an additional +30 chips. This looks promising!\n**Planning card play order**\n\nThe Mult card, 7♦, adds +4 to the multiplier when scored, but it only applies to the first card played. My goal is to use A♥ as the first scoring card because it can trigger further scores when played. I can choose the order of the cards, as demonstrated in a previous action. I'll position A♥ first, followed by A♣ to trigger Scholar, and then I need to decide on the last card. Forming a pair of Aces looks like the best option since creating three of a kind isn't possible.\n**Estimating chip totals**\n\nI’m analyzing the chip values for potential card combinations. A pair of Aces offers the best base with 40 chips and a multiplier of 4. Trying to make a straight or flush doesn’t seem possible, so I’ll focus on the Pair. With the Splash rule, every card contributes to scoring. I’ll pick the best five cards: A♥ (bonus), A♣, 7♦, Q♦, and 10♣. I’ll estimate the chips: that gives me a total of 79 chips, including bonuses!\n**Analyzing multiplayer effects**\n\nI’m diving into some detailed calculations about scoring in the game. If I only have one Ancient Joker active, my chips and multipliers come to a specific total, but it looks like I need to consider the effects of potential suits from the Jokers. Each one could impact scores significantly, depending on the suits matched. I think the best strategy is to mix cards that could trigger both Jokers, focusing on hearts and spades to maximize my chances. This ensures I can clear the necessary chip threshold, even if there’s uncertainty around the suits!\n**Confirming hand strategy**\n\nI’m realizing from earlier hands that I definitely have at least one heart trigger, so I can rely on that for scoring. Even if the other Ancient isn't hearts, I'd still achieve a decent score with the cards I have. Playing A♥ first will maximize the score since it retriggers. The plan is to play A♥, A♣, 7♦, Q♦, and 10♣. I estimate the score could exceed 14,000 chips, comfortably pushing above the required threshold!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,8,7,6]"}
