{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nI'm examining the Splash override in the game. It seems that every played card counts toward scoring, which means all cards can trigger enhancements, even jokers. In Balatro, Splash allows all selected played cards to score, especially with Ancient Jokers. For example, if I play 5 hearts, all of them score, leading to a significant multiplier effect. Additionally, there's a tactical item called Diet Cola that can create a free double tag. I’m wondering if that appears as a joker in the shop.\n**Considering joker options**\n\nI just realized Diet Cola is a Joker and costs $6, using a joker slot. Since I already have the maximum of 5 jokers, I'd need to sell one to buy it. The benefit is that I can later sell it to create a Double Tag. Should I consider dropping something? Cloud 9 gives $4 per round, but it doesn't impact scoring. I’m weighing whether to replace Cloud 9 with Splash, another joker. However, I'd need to sell a joker again. Which one makes sense? Cloud 9 seems low scoring but offers monetary benefits.\n**Weighing joker strategies**\n\nI’m considering the need for money to reroll for better jokers or to upgrade hand levels. Cloud 9 gives $4 per round plus interest, which is decent, but Splash could significantly increase scoring. Our current score is pretty high at 35,680 from a small blind with 3 aces and 2 hearts. If I replace Cloud 9 with Splash, I could potentially include additional hearts to multiply scores even further. I’m debating whether to replace Cloud 9 or possibly Hanging Chad, which has its own scaling advantages with the retriggering first card.\n**Assessing card choices**\n\nWith Splash, I can use 5 cards and still keep Chad, which seems like a solid plan. Scholar is essential for Aces, and while running double Ancient might be powerful, it could be overkill. It looks like Cloud 9 is the one to sacrifice. Late game seems to favor scoring over money, and I can still maintain some economy through interest. Diet Cola would add complexity since it requires another joker slot, which means dropping something else. Its Double Tag potential could be great, but I’d have to weigh that against the possible loss in shop opportunities.\n**Evaluating purchases and strategy**\n\nI realized that I could buy Diet Cola as a joker and then sell it for about $3, creating a free Double Tag in the process. Even though I'd temporarily lose a joker slot, I can do this right away in the shop. If I skip a big tag for Meteor, I might get two Mega Celestial packs, but skipping the big means no shop before the boss. That makes me reconsider. If I buy both Arcana and Celestial packs, they could help level up hands, especially since I still have $11 after purchases. Given that high cards are seldom useful, I might sell my Pluto consumable to free up space. Overall, I need to balance my purchases with what will be most beneficial for my current strategy.\n**Strategizing purchases and actions**\n\nAfter the big blind, things might change, but I'm confident we can adapt given our strong scoring. I'm considering investing in deck manipulation to support Aces and hearts. I plan to buy both the Arcana and Celestial packs, costing $8, leaving me with $3. Rerolling for jokers could reveal better options, but I’ll need to sell Cloud 9 first to free up a slot. It seems like selling Cloud 9 is the best immediate action to take right now. I’ll proceed with that and then look into my next steps!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
