{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nWith Splash, all 5 cards score no matter what, so hand type is crucial for base chips and multipliers. For a high card level 3, we get base chips of 25 with a multiplier of 3, which isn't amazing, but ancient bonuses can really add up. Alternatively, I could play 4 hearts, but I need at least 1 card. Playing 5 cards works too. To make a straight, I see I'm missing A, K, Q, J, 10. A flush could happen if I draw another heart. I could discard non-hearts to improve my chances of drawing that heart!\n**Calculating potential scores**\n\nI need 22,000 chips, and my previous pair gave me 37,000, so I see a chance to win in one hand with my 4 hearts and something extra. Let's estimate how that might work. If I assume the Joker order is Scholar, Ancient1, Ancient2, Chad, and Splash, here's what I think: Scholar gives me +20 chips and a 4x multiplier for Aces. Ancient triggers multiply hearts by 1.5. Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card, scoring two additional times. It seems to retrigger after scoring, impacting my overall score too. I have to wonder, does the order really matter for the scoring?\n**Deciding on card combinations**\n\nSince it’s a static setup, I’m thinking of playing 5 cards with a high card base. However, with Splash, playing a pair could really boost my base chips and multiplier—like a pair level 5 with a base of 70 and a multiplier of 6. I have two Jacks (J♥ and J♦), so if I play both along with K, Q, and 6 hearts, I get the pair of Jacks and 4 hearts. But wait, one Jack is a diamond, which complicates things. Still, the pair improves my base, and all 5 cards score. I think both Jacks have to be in there, along with the best hearts. But I have to keep it to 5 cards total. This needs careful planning!\n**Refining the card strategy**\n\nI’m looking at my hand now: it includes J♥ and maybe 6♥, giving me 4 hearts and a pair of Jacks. So, I’d have K♥, Q♥, J♥, 6♥, and J♦, which is helpful. However, I don’t have an Ace, which means I miss out on the Scholar trigger since it only activates on played Aces. If I include A♣ to gain that trigger, I’d need to drop either a Q or the 6, reducing my hearts to 3. This would improve my base chips but decrease my scoring multiplier by a factor of 2.25. I'm curious just how much of a difference that makes! I need to arrange the order of playing to maximize multipliers, starting with the heart, maybe K♥ for its multiplier.\n**Optimizing card play strategy**\n\nI want to ensure my pair of Jacks is recognized, but it seems the order won’t impact scoring since Splash allows all cards to contribute. I’m thinking of the optimal play set: K♥, Q♥, J♥, 6♥, and J♦, which would give me a pair of Jacks and 4 hearts. Each card adds its chip value, and since K adds a +4 multiplier, I'll benefit more if I score K♥ first. This way, it boosts my multiplier before other hearts score. By scoring K♥ first and using retriggers, I can maximize my total score even further. It looks like I can easily aim for over 22k chips if I plan the sequence correctly!\n**Planning the card play**\n\nI can only play up to 5 cards, and the scoring order depends on their left-to-right arrangement in my hand. Luckily, they appear in that order: K♥, Q♥, J♥, 6♥, and J♦. So, I don’t need to rearrange anything. My current hand has the cards in the right order already. I'm aiming for a pair of Jacks, and I estimate my chips to be around 180,000, possibly rounding from 150,000+. I’ll create the action JSON with these positions, intended hand type, and my estimated chips. Let's move forward!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,8]"}
