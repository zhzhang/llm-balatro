{"reasoning":"**Calculating diamond probabilities**\n\nI'm considering how ice cream decreases my chips, but winning might hinge on strong hands like a flush or straight. Discarding non-diamonds could help draw more diamonds since I need five for a flush. I have two diamonds now, so can I draw three from the remaining deck after a discard? I'll use hypergeometric probability to find the chances of succeeding when drawing five cards. I think I can do some quick calculations in my head or mentally with Python!\n**Estimating diamond outcomes**\n\nI’m estimating expected diamonds from a discard and drawing scenario, roughly calculating that I might get about 1.41 diamonds, which doesn’t seem promising for at least three. Even with three, I'd have five for a flush. Winning in one hand is my main goal to save ice cream and potentially earn more money. I have a coupon for my next shop, so I can focus on discards to aim for a diamond flush and maximize my chips!\n**Analyzing winning hands**\n\nI’m thinking that if the low ranks average around 7 each, I'd total 35 chips, which would lead to a significant amount of 5,100 chips when multiplied. A flush could easily win! I could also aim for a straight with multiple diamonds, which would trigger multipliers for each diamond. For my current hand, I see I could draw a straight, but I need to discard some cards while keeping my diamonds. Let's keep the diamonds and 10♠ and Q♣ for high ranks!\n**Deciding which cards to keep**\n\nI’m thinking of keeping my 10♠ and Q♣ just in case I need high cards, but that's only worth one point, so maybe it’s not the best idea. I’ll keep 8♦ and 6♦ for sure. I might also keep the 6♥ for a potential pair. So if I discard five cards, I’ll have three left. If I draw three diamonds in the next five, I'd secure a flush, but I'll stick with the 6♥ for a fallback pair. Discarding 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 sounds like a plan!\n**Planning discards and draws**\n\nI’ll go ahead and draw five cards. After that, I can evaluate whether to play for a flush, a straight, or a pair. Since I have three discards available, it makes sense to use one now. So, I’ll discard cards 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. This strategy should set me up nicely for whichever hand I decide to pursue! It’s all about making the best choice based on my next draw.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
