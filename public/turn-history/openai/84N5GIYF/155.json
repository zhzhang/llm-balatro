{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card multipliers**\n\nI'm considering how the Ancient card works well with hearts, even if they're not in hand. Each heart played scores with a 1.5 multiplier, and the splash triggers scoring for every played card. The Hanging Chad retriggers the first card twice, which could also be a heart, giving additional x1.5 scores. The Tribe doubles if we make a flush easily. It’s good to think about whether to include Spare Trousers in our strategy, but it seems I need to weigh our options carefully.\n**Deciding on joker drops**\n\nI'm figuring out which joker to drop since we need to make space. The Splash and Hanging Chad cards are important, and the Ancient cards are core to our strategy. The Tribe is strong if we make a flush. The 8 Ball gives a tarot chance but takes a joker slot, which makes it a weak option. If we sell the 8 Ball, we’ll drop to five jokers, which means I need to consider if we should sell another joker instead. Keeping that extra slot is crucial!\n**Assessing joker options**\n\nI’m considering swapping the 8 Ball for Spare Trousers, but we'd drop to a maximum of five jokers after the sale. If we buy the Spare Trousers after selling the 8 Ball, we'd have five jokers and a max of five, which is okay. However, I'd lose the joker effect from the 8 Ball but gain the polychrome x1.5 benefit. I realize selling the Hanging Chad might not be good since it boosts the first played card's score significantly. Keeping Chad seems crucial!\n**Evaluating replacements and upgrades**\n\nThe Tribe doubles scores if we get a flush, and we can create that easily using Sun to convert to hearts, which synergizes with Ancient cards. This means the Tribe is valuable. I’m considering replacing the 8 Ball since its effect is minor apart from the slot. But I’d still have five slots left, which is fine. The Spare Trousers provide a constant x1.5 multiplier, and with the game nearing the end, I think it's better to sell the 8 Ball and get the Spare Trousers. Also, I noticed the shop has Walkie Talkie for $4, which could be useful too!\n**Planning joker transactions**\n\nI need to sell a joker to make room for something better, and the 8 Ball seems like the weakest option since its effect is minor. If I sell it, I can then consider buying the Spare Trousers or an Arcana pack, which could improve my deck for the boss. I’m thinking the immediate utility of the Spare Trousers is crucial, and rearranging my jokers could maximize their effectiveness. So, the best first action is to sell the 8 Ball!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
