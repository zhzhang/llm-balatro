{"reasoning":"**Processing shop card actions**\n\nI'm noting that the `buy_and_use_consumable` function requires the `consumable_position` in the shop card section, and Mercury is identified as shop card 1. So, it looks like I need to set the action JSON to include `buy_and_use_consumable` with position [1] and specify no hand type. This seems pretty straightforward! I just want to make sure I follow the requirements accurately.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
