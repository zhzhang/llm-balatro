{"reasoning":"**Evaluating scoring triggers**\n\nI’m thinking about how the first card can retrigger and score additional times, likely after scoring, and whether this effect needs to be reordered for maximum gain. If I have multiple retrigger jokers, the order will matter, but only for the chad. It seems like the ancients are on-scored, so I should work with them before considering any multipliers. Alright, I'll just proceed with playing the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
