{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy in the shop**\n\nI’m in the shop after selecting Jupiter and have $24 to work with. I’ve got various jokers: double Ancients, Hanging Chad, Odd Todd, and Cloud 9. I need to improve my scoring or deck manipulation. The shop has Green Joker, Wrathful Joker, and Jumbo Arcana pack. I’m considering whether to replace either Cloud 9 or Odd Todd with a scoring multiplier. The Ancient jokers provide a significant multiplier for diamond cards, which could lead to a huge score if I stack them!\n**Maximizing scoring with jokers**\n\nAncient jokers trigger their bonuses when scored and also on retriggers—this means I need to maximize my scoring potential. The first card I score should ideally be a diamond to apply the x1.5 multiplier from both Ancients with each retrigger. Odd Todd adds chips on odd ranks, and retriggering can significantly boost my score. Cloud 9 is more about economy rather than scoring. Green Joker offers multiplier scaling, but I might need to drop Cloud 9 to focus on diamonds and potential suit changes.\n**Preparing for the next round**\n\nI currently have two Ancient jokers, and the suit will change at the end of the round. Right now, it’s diamonds, which I can take advantage of in the upcoming blind. I should focus on maximizing my scoring instead of a longer-term strategy. It looks like we’re in Round 6 with Ante 4. Since we're in the shop, I need to consider buying a Jumbo Arcana pack, which can enhance my deck with valuable cards like The Star that convert cards to diamonds!\n**Buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack**\n\nI don’t have any consumables right now, but I can get the Jumbo Arcana Pack, which gives me immediate tarot cards to use without occupying my slot—perfect! So, buying the Arcana Pack sounds like the best move. If I drop Cloud 9, I’ll lose $4 per round, but since I have $24, I can sustain that for now. The Arcana Pack could offer cards like The Star or Strength. Once I get the pack for $6, I’ll think about rerolling for better jokers!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
