{"reasoning":"**Considering Balatro mechanics**\n\nHmm, so in Balatro, you use tarot in the shop, and it pulls random cards from the deck. It seems you actually choose a card from your deck rather than just what's in your hand of 8. Interesting! But in this simulator, it treats it as \"cards in hand,\" which might limit your options since there's no current hand supplied. Oh, and I could sell consumables for money, but rerolling costs might complicate things. Maybe selling a joker is a better way to get funds for Uranus?\n**Thinking about strategy and sales**\n\nI need $3 to get where I want, and selling Splash for $1 gives me $2, so I'm still short. If I sell Scholar for $2, I’ll reach $3 and can buy Uranus, which levels Two Pair. But I'm leaning towards focusing on Pair and flush instead. \n\nEnding the shop phase and moving to the next round makes sense, but I should also think about rearranging the jokers for optimal triggering, especially since the order matters for my strategies with Ancient and Scholar.\n**Analyzing Splash and card order**\n\nIt seems that Splash makes every played card count in scoring independently, which is interesting. So, it modifies the scoring to include all played cards as part of the hand, but it doesn't trigger on its own. I'm thinking that the order may matter, especially with jokers applying left-to-right for each scored card. \n\nIf I start with the Ace of Spades and consider how each card in my current order impacts the multiplication, I'll want to place Scholar before Ancients to optimize the score. The best sequence might be Scholar, Ancient1, Ancient2, Hanging Chad, and Splash, rearranging Hanging Chad as a retrigger.\n**Clarifying retrigger mechanics**\n\nI see that Hanging Chad is supposed to retrigger the first played card used in scoring two additional times, likely during the retrigger phase after the on-scored jokers. The order of these jokers might matter, especially since it triggers left-to-right. Putting Hanging Chad earlier could be beneficial, but if it's after Ancients, it will retrigger after their effects. \n\nEach retriggering joker acts in succession, but its order relative to others could vary. I think it's crucial to keep Scholar before Ancients to maximize the additive multiplier effects with every score.\n**Deciding on card order and strategy**\n\nI’m considering placing Splash first, but it seems like it doesn’t really matter. The on-scored jokers trigger for each scoring card in order, so if Ancient is before Scholar, Scholar’s +4 multiplier wouldn’t be as effective. I should keep Scholar first and perhaps put Splash last.\n\nSince I can't buy anything, moving to the round_select makes sense. I could think about selling Chariot to afford a reroll, but since I’d need $2, it’s better to keep Chariot for its potential multiplier effect later. I can proceed with round_select and set up the JSON for that action!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
