{"reasoning":"**Analyzing hearts scoring**\n\nI realize that while playing hearts doesn’t score directly, it can help form hand types like pairs. With splash, the scoring includes cards but gives them a value of zero. I think it might be strategic to focus on playing five strong cards instead. Aiming for pairs is important since they hold high value, and we could score big in one hand. Currently, I have cards that could contribute to a king pair, but the heart king is debuffed.\n**Estimating card hand value**\n\nI’m considering that other played cards can function as kickers, and for this hand, we're aiming for pair of kings. With splash, it seems every played card counts in scoring, even those not forming the hand type. That’s great because kickers add chips too! However, we’re currently lacking clubs, which means we miss out on the xmult scaling from the Ancient trigger. While we still have a strong base multiplier, without clubs, reaching 40k might be tricky based on past scoring.\n**Calculating pair scoring**\n\nFor the pair, my base chips are 100 with a multiplier of 8. Played cards will add their chip values, and with splash, I’ll get chips from all played cards. The King of Spades adds 10, and the Jack and Ten of Diamonds each add 10 as well, totaling around 130 chips. However, since the hearts are debuffed, they won’t contribute any chips. Even with retriggers, we might end up at 3,900 chips, which is way below the target of 40k.\n**Prioritizing clubs for scoring**\n\nI realize I need club cards to maximize my scoring potential. Since I have some debuffed hearts in my discards, it seems wise to get rid of those to find clubs and ranks for forming a pair. A pair would be great since it's high-level, but it’s worth considering a flush too. With two Ancient Jokers and playing five clubs, I could achieve a massive multiplier. I know I need clubs regardless since the Ancient requires the club suit.\n**Strategizing card discards**\n\nI’m planning to discard all five debuffed hearts to avoid drawing more, keeping the King of Spades and the Jack and Ten of Diamonds. After that, I hope to draw clubs and evaluate the hand for play. I need to reach 40,000 across four hands, which will take time. I also have The Chariot to turn a high-value card into steel, but I need to hold it in my hand to activate its multiplier. However, it seems best to prioritize playing five clubs for a greater multiplier, so I’ll go ahead and discard the hearts.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
