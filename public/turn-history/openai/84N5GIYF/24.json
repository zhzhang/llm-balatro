{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategy**\n\nI’m thinking we should play exactly 2 cards to maintain more in hand. While the play command allows up to 5 cards, if we go with 2, we can keep 6 cards since we draw new ones equal to what we played. However, maybe it’s better to aim for a flush or straight using more diamonds. Discarding 5 non-diamond cards could help find diamonds, and discarding isn’t counted against our hand size, which is useful!\n**Evaluating flush strategy**\n\nI'm considering if building a flush of five diamonds is worthwhile. If I score all five, I’d get a multiplier of 30.375, resulting in about 5315 chips after adding bonuses. That would clear the blind easily, but hitting five diamonds feels unlikely. However, playing a diamond-heavy hand, like a high card or pair, could still work. For Ancient, each scoring diamond boosts the multiplier. We could technically create a straight with some diamonds for extra benefits!\n**Planning diamond strategy**\n\nI’m considering how to build an optimal hand with diamonds, realizing that while a flush isn’t necessary, having several diamonds is crucial. It might be simpler to play a 5-card hand with 3-4 diamonds, like a full house. To maximize triggers for diamonds, I should aim to play 5 cards since each diamond counts. I've only got 1 diamond right now. Discarding non-diamonds to draw more seems like a good idea, especially since there are 12 diamonds in the deck. I can discard up to 5 cards to improve my chances.\n**Evaluating discard strategy**\n\nI'm considering whether to use additional discards to get 5 diamonds. We have a blind of 1200 and Ice Cream, so even a mediocre hand with 2 diamonds might work. Another option is to play the pair of 8s for 634, then aim for the remaining 566 in another round. But since Ice Cream reduces to 95 after the first hand, it might be safer to focus on discarding 5 non-diamonds to boost my diamond count instead, allowing me to attempt clearing in one hand!\n**Planning for a winning hand**\n\nIf I can win in one hand, that gives me 3 hands remaining, totaling $7 after rewards and interest, which is great! Setting up one strong hand with the help of discards seems wise, even if I can’t predict success. I’ll start by discarding some cards to hunt for diamonds or a flush. I should keep the 8♦ and consider the pair 8♥, but focusing on diamonds might be better. \n\nI think I’ll discard the non-diamonds while possibly holding onto cards that can contribute to a straight or might help build a better pair. So, I’ll go ahead and discard 5 cards and keep the 4♠, 3♣, and 8♦. Let's proceed!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
