{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about a flush build and how to use Sun or Moon to convert cards. It seems like we want more diamonds instead of hearts or clubs, so maybe Sun/Moon isn't the right choice. The Empress can enhance two cards to become Mult Cards, boosting their score. I'll focus on diamond cards like the King, Jack, and 7, applying the mult factor. If I play it right, especially on the first scored card, I could rack up significant multipliers!\n**Evaluating scoring options**\n\nI'm considering using the 7 of Diamonds as the first scoring card in a flush. The scoring order goes from left to right, so I might want to arrange my hand strategically. I can reorder cards in each round, and having a multiplier enhancement on my first card is valuable. Enhancing the 7 of Diamonds along with another diamond or a spade could be beneficial. However, the Empress seems like a solid choice for power, while Temperance might not be necessary right now. It’s a bit risky, but selling Cloud 9 could open up opportunities for a better joker.\n**Choosing card targets**\n\nSince the Empress is guaranteed, I should aim to enhance two cards with it. The ideal choice would be high-frequency scoring cards like the 7 of Diamonds and possibly the 9 of Spades, even though the 9 isn't a diamond. The 7 of Diamonds can really stack with my other powers, plus targeting the King of Diamonds makes sense for a high rank, even if Odd Todd doesn’t trigger for it. I might want to choose the King for potential flush uses, but I have to keep in mind that suits can change. Balancing between diamonds and spades is key right now.\n**Exploring card options**\n\nIn this round, I'm considering playing a diamond flush, but I only have three diamonds. Still, I could aim for a pair or three of a kind if necessary. My flush level is decent, and last flush was huge, so maybe there are more diamonds in the deck? I’d target the 7 of Diamonds for synergy with Odd Todd and perhaps the 9 of Spades if I’m thinking about spade flush opportunities. Also, the Wrathful Joker could give a nice boost to spades if I purchase it later. It seems wise to target both the 7 of Diamonds and the 9 of Spades for maximum gain!\n**Arranging cards for flush**\n\nFor a spade flush, I can rearrange my hand to ensure the multiplier card is played first. With the 9 of Spades as a multiplier and going for that flush, it simplifies things. If I end up playing a diamond flush later, I want to put the 7 of Diamonds in a strategic position too. So, I'll choose the 7 of Diamonds (position 8) and the 9 of Spades (position 1). Now, I just need to make sure to verify that the tarot pack selection correctly requires two cards for the Empress, and I'll respond with select 1 1 8.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1,8]"}
