{"reasoning":"**Deciding on actions**\n\nI need to decide on my next move since the boss effect is disabled. I’m aiming for 600 chips and I have 4 hands left. The best option seems to be playing a flush with the 5 spades (A♠ Q♠ 10♠ 8♠ 7♠ or 6♠). The combination of A, Q, 10, 8, and 7 gives me a total of 46, and 35 chips as a base. After multiplying, I get a total of 324 chips. I’ll play cards 1-5 as a flush.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
