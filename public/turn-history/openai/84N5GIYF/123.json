{"reasoning":"**Evaluating Joker Purchase**\n\nI need to decide my next move in the shop. We sold a scholar and now have $10. I already have 5 jokers, and I'm considering buying the Abstract Joker for $4 because it adds +3 multiplier per joker. After buying it, I would have 6 jokers. The tricky part is understanding how the multiplier works. It seems to be about whether it includes itself or excludes itself, which affects the multiplier calculations. I think I’ll go for the purchase!\n**Clarifying Joker Calculations**\n\nIn turn 122, the shop card displayed a +18 multiplier when I had 6 jokers. This suggests it was counting the jokers I owned—excluding the Abstract Joker since I didn't have it yet. If I buy it, I'd have 7 jokers, which doesn't fit the max limit of 6, but the negative 8 ball doesn’t count toward this limit. So, buying the Abstract would raise my total to 6 jokers, and I believe the multiplier will then correctly show +18. I feel like I'm getting this!\n**Assessing Upgrade Options**\n\nI'm considering the benefits of buying the Abstract Joker, which could significantly boost my multiplier. There's also the option to purchase an Overstock voucher for $10 to gain an extra shop slot, but I’d lose the chance to buy the Abstract. Given we're up against higher blinds soon, it seems more strategic to prioritize scoring. After that, I'd have $6 left to spend on a Jumbo Celestial or Standard pack, both potentially helpful for my strategy. I think buying Abstract is the way to go!\n**Deciding on Card Purchases**\n\nThe Celestial pack seems promising since Planet Merchant doubles the planet frequency, and it might include Mercury, which is great for pairs. The Standard pack adds a card, potentially giving me clubs which are necessary for ancients. But the suit changes at the end of each round, so it will still be clubs for the upcoming boss. With my Chariot consumable, I could save it for a strong card next round. However, my immediate action should be to buy the Abstract Joker. I’ll go for it!\n**Weighing Purchase Decisions**\n\nI’m debating whether to buy the Overstock voucher, but I think scoring is more important than the extra shop slot. I could buy it later after the Abstract purchase, but I’ll have only $6 left, so it’s not feasible right now. I need to think about the order of my jokers, as their activation works left-to-right. This could matter for the Ancient and 8 Ball jokers since their multiplayers depend on position. For now, I’ll proceed with the Abstract purchase!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
