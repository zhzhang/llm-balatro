{"reasoning":"**Considering purchases in the shop**\n\nI’ve just purchased Mega Celestial and selected Jupiter and Pluto, leaving me with exactly $6. There’s a Cloud 9 pack for $7, but I can't afford that. I could buy the Jumbo Arcana pack for $6, which might enhance my tarot deck. The Arcana offers immediate tarot benefits for deck manipulation, which could help in the upcoming boss fight. Investing in the Arcana seems like the best route for power.\n**Deciding on the pack purchase**\n\nI'm thinking that buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack will take some time, but it still seems like a good idea. So, my plan is to buy the Booster 1 pack. After that, I’ll need to select my tarot cards. This step feels important since it could really impact my strategy. Alright, let’s go ahead and make that purchase! Buying Booster 1 is my next action.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
