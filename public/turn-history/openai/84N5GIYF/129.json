{"reasoning":"**Figuring out card discards**\n\nI'm thinking about how to discard cards, maybe tossing out some hearts and looking for clubs or 8s for tarot. Wait, we have three discards left. Perhaps I should let go of two hearts and a few spades to keep high ranks. Since we want to beat the boss quickly, I wonder if we can do that in one or two plays with clubs. Oh, it seems our previous pair scored 58k on the Big Blind, indicating we might exceed that threshold.\n**Calculating card multipliers**\n\nI’m considering how many clubs might be played since splash counts all played cards. In a pair, only the first card activates scoring. To reach 58k, I must have had decent clubs. With the abstract multiplier of +18, the base multiplier for a pair is 8, making it 26. If I have 2 ancients and 2 clubs, the multiplier could be around 130 chips, leading to about 19,500. But if the first card is a club, it could retrigger and increase the ancient's multiplier each time it scores.\n**Estimating card multipliers**\n\nI'm thinking about how one club card can score multiple times, with each multiplication by 1.5 leading to a total multiplier of about 11.4 if retriggered. Currently, I have the 5♣ as the sole club, and I could arrange my hand to make it the first scoring card for maximum retrigger potential. However, the best hand type at level 7 is a pair, and I don’t have one. The next best is three of a kind, so I might aim for a high card, perhaps aiming for a King high instead.\n**Calculating card scores with splash**\n\nI'm working through how splash impacts scoring. Every played card counts, even if it's not part of the highest hand. If I have a hand type of high card, that's level 3 with a base of 25 chips. If I play K, Q, J, 10, and 5♣, the total could be 70 chips: 25 base plus chips from each card played. So, that's 25 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5. Now, I need to multiply this by the base multiplier of 3.\n**Considering Chariot usage**\n\nI realize that Chariot is a consumable, and we need to use it wisely to beat this boss. I could apply it on a high-value card or a debuffed heart, but those hearts have their abilities disabled, including any steel effects. If I were to use Chariot to turn a non-heart into steel and keep it in hand, that could work. Right now, it seems best to discard those three cards: 3, 4, and 5, and make that decision later when things are more stable.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,5]"}
