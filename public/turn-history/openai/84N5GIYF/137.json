{"reasoning":"**Considering boss strategy**\n\nI need to strategize for beating a boss that requires 140k points with my heart flush, which is already at level 4. The planet pack options don’t include Jupiter or Saturn, so I'm looking at Mars for four of a kind, Neptune for a straight flush, Earth for a full house, Pluto for a high card, or Venus for three of a kind. Historically, I usually play Pair at level 7 due to the base chips and potential synergy with Splash and Ancient for scoring.\n**Exploring hand combinations**\n\nI can play a pair while also incorporating 3 hearts, and with Splash, those hearts score and trigger the Ancient multiplier of x1.5 each. This means my pair can generate base chips of 100, multiplied by 8, plus the Ancient multiplier for heart cards. However, Tribe may activate only if the hand contains a Flush. While a pair doesn’t contain a Flush, I can still play 5 hearts with a pair within them. The best hand simply becomes the Flush; it seems the hand still contains another hand type if it can be formed with the cards used.\n**Analyzing hand strategies**\n\nA flush of 5 hearts that includes a pair can indeed form a pair, meaning the flush contains the pair. With the hand containing a flush, Tribe should trigger too. So, aiming for a flush makes sense since it gives base chips of 80 with a multiplier of 10, plus the Ancient multiplier per heart and Tribe’s x2. The next best option would be three of a kind, especially using Venus to strengthen that since we're already at level 4. Four of a kind seems less likely, so I'm focusing primarily on flush strategies.\n**Evaluating hand options**\n\nIncreasing base chips and multipliers is crucial for when we can’t create a flush or when we decide to play trips with hearts using Splash. I’m considering Pluto for a high card as well, since, with Splash, even a low hand could score if the boss has certain restrictions—although we’re unsure of the boss effects right now. I believe three of a kind is the most practical option since it adds a +2 multiplier and +20 chips, taking us to 110 chips with an 11 multiplier at level 5. That should help in case we miss the flush!\n**Selecting hand options**\n\nI’m considering Mars for a four of a kind at level 3, which gives me 120 chips and a 13 multiplier, but four of a kind is pretty rare. Earth offers a full house, but I’ve only played that once, so it’s more situational. Neptune’s straight flush is extremely rare as well. Given these factors, I think picking Venus is the best option. I’ll need to use the \"select 5\" command and provide the action in JSON format accordingly.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
