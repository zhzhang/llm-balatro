{"reasoning":"**Assessing card value for Venus purchase**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to sell Splash or Hanging Chad to raise money for Venus, which costs $3. Selling Splash gives me $1 and doesn’t cover the cost. If I sell both Splash and Hanging Chad, I can make $4 and purchase Venus, but I wonder if it's worth sacrificing those cards. Hanging Chad has great synergy with Scholar and Ancients, and Splash significantly enhances scoring. Therefore, both cards hold immense value, so I shouldn't sell anything to buy Venus.\n**Deciding on re-rolling options**\n\nWith $1, I could reroll for a cheap joker, but I can't buy anything with just that. I wonder if it's better to reroll and hope for a joker to sell? Alternatively, I could proceed and earn more money at the next shop. But if I reroll, I lose $1, and then I can't buy anything, so that doesn’t seem good. I should just move on to the next blinds. \n\nAlso, I need to think about the optimal order for triggering jokers for scoring. Scoring happens left to right, with Scholar boosting chips and multipliers when Aces are scored. The Ancient card triggers a multiplier based on the suit, but I need to confirm the additive versus multiplicative rules for scoring. It's probably best to have Scholar come before Ancient to maximize the benefits.\n**Understanding the scoring order**\n\nIf I score a club Ace, Scholar adds a +4 multiplier, and then Ancient increases that multiplier by 1.5, which sounds beneficial. I have two Ancients, so I’m considering the best order: Scholar, Ancient, Ancient, and then Hanging Chad? Well, Hanging Chad seems to act independently, retriggering the first played card two additional times. \n\nI wonder if its position matters since it likely triggers after the card is scored. In Balatro, Hanging Chad works within the scoring phase. However, Splash is independent and affects which cards count towards scoring, so it might need to come earlier. But I'm not sure if its effects trigger or just alter the scoring conditions.\n**Rearranging for optimal order**\n\nThe position of the cards may not matter overall, but it's safer to rearrange them strategically. I could set them as Scholar, then Ancient1, Ancient2, Hanging Chad, and finally Splash. Or maybe Hanging Chad should go before Ancient since it affects the retriggering. If I want Ancient to boost the retriggered cards, their order will matter, especially with the scoring iterations multiplying correctly.\n\nMaybe the ideal order is Scholar first, followed by the two Ancients, Hanging Chad, and then Splash, since Chad falls into the retriggering category. It seems achieving the best sequence still counts!\n**Evaluating card positions in scoring**\n\nI’m thinking it might be safe to place Hanging Chad at the rightmost position, but it’s not clear if that really matters. The game rules indicate that played cards score left-to-right, triggering various effects during this process.\n\nHanging Chad acts as a retriggering joker, so its position among retriggering jokers should be left-to-right. However, since it has no scoring ability, it doesn’t affect the options from the “on-scored” phase. So, I can proceed without changing anything, moving on to the next round selection.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
