{"reasoning":"**Evaluating consumption options**\n\nI’m considering my consumable slots, specifically focusing on Pluto right now. I could buy Earth to use later if needed, but I'm unsure if that's wise and would rather preserve cash. The cash isn’t gaining interest below 5%, so spending $3 could provide value. However, Earth isn't beneficial. If I replace Cloud 9, I’d end up losing $4 per round. Therefore, I will finalize my round selection and prepare the output JSON action.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
