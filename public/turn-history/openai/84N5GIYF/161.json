{"reasoning":"**Considering card modifications**\n\nI'm thinking about how the Death ability modifies selected cards in the deck. It allows me to select two cards and convert one into an exact copy of the other. For instance, I could change the King of Clubs into a 9 of Hearts mult card, which adds more hearts and enhances synergy. I could also convert a Spade 5 into a Steel 4 of Hearts. It seems important to consider how these changes impact my strategy, especially for the final boss.\n**Selecting card conversions**\n\nI'm thinking about whether I can create a joker since I need room to do so. It seems like I would have to sell a joker before selecting a card, but the selection happens immediately. The Fool card creates the last tarot used, but we're not sure which tarot that is since we haven't used any recently. After weighing my options, I decide it's clearer to go with Death. I can convert a non-heart card to a 9 of hearts mult for a stronger strategy. Now, which card should I convert?\n**Deciding card conversion**\n\nI'm choosing a card to convert, likely the 5 of Spades since it has low value. Since the conversion modifies the deck, the suit and rank will change, but it shouldn't be a problem. I want to select card 3 (Death) and pick positions for the left and right cards. I'll convert the 5♠ into 9♥ mult, which adds more hearts and enhances synergy. I need to ensure that my target order for the action is correct, so I'll proceed and prepare the action JSON for \"select.\"\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,1,2]"}
