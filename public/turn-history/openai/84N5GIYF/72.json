{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker mechanics**\n\nI see we have full joker slots, and replacing Cloud 9 might be an option, though it's stable at $4 per round. The Green Joker could scale rapidly with more hands, but it penalizes discards. Rearranging the order of jokers seems important because it affects independent multipliers versus additive ones. I think Ancient jokers are categorized based on the scored step, and their order does matter for multiplication triggers. It’s starting to get complicated!\n**Deciding on joker strategy**\n\nI'm considering the order for retrigger jokers—probably left-to-right—but since there's only one, it might not matter. I'm weighing whether to buy the Wrathful joker and thinking about selling either Cloud 9 or Green to make space. Cloud 9's economy may not be necessary right now since we have some funds available. \n\nHowever, Wrathful offers a decent multiplier, but Green might scale more easily. I've got two strong xmult ancients already, so I’m leaning toward getting another xmult joker like Vampire. I'd prefer to reroll for better options before committing to anything!\n**Exploring card options**\n\nI’m looking at the Ancient suit, which can change to spades or hearts—this could create synergy with Wrathful and my spade cards. But I'm uncertain about the best move. Ideally, I want an xmult joker like Constellation since I could use it with planet frequency. \n\nI should probably reroll the shop to find planet cards, but I'm remembering that the shop includes jokers and consumables. Rerolling might offer better options, especially since we have a decent flush level. Although I can buy planet cards when they show up, I have to be strategic about spending. Current reroll cost is 3, so I’ll keep that in mind!\n**Formulating a plan for jokers**\n\nI need a solid plan here. One option is selling Cloud 9 to acquire Wrathful, which could help build a spade flush and improve consistency with spades in my deck. My example hand has plenty of spades, so that could be beneficial. \n\nHowever, the Ancient suit currently wants diamonds, but that could shift at the end of the round. If the next suit becomes spades, having Wrathful could stack nicely, though I’m uncertain how each Ancient independently chooses their suits. It's tricky!\n**Analyzing joker trade-offs**\n\nI'm weighing the pros and cons of getting Wrathful by selling Cloud 9, which may help with building a spade flush. Wrathful only costs $5, so it's a manageable investment. If I keep Cloud 9, I might sell the Green Joker instead, even though it fits well with my current strategy.\n\nSelling Cloud 9 could improve my multipliers, and considering the joker order matters, I should place Wrathful before any Ancients to maximize their effects. However, since the Ancient suit is currently diamonds, I need to think carefully about upcoming rounds and whether I can adapt my strategy effectively!\n**Deciding next steps**\n\nFor the next blind, since the Ancient suit targets diamonds, I think it makes sense to focus on maximizing those. Wrathful is irrelevant for diamond hands, so I’ll skip it. The Green Joker is universal, and maybe I should rearrange the jokers to prioritize it, but since it’s independent, it might not matter too much.\n\nMy best move seems to be rerolling the shop to find a better joker or something else useful. I have $16, and rerolling costs $3, so I can afford a few rerolls! Let's go with that approach.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
