{"reasoning":"**Exploring game dynamics**\n\nI’m considering how the Ancient suit affects the end of rounds, and right now, it's Hearts. For a boss, we start with no discards, which gives us flexibility in hand choices. The reliability of planets may not significantly affect strategies. Mars has a four of a kind with a nice bonus, but achieving that is tough. Saturn offers a straight, which we haven't used, while Jupiter has a flush that aligns well. I want to evaluate which hand types we usually rely on in play.\n**Calculating Ancient Jokers' impact**\n\nI'm figuring out how the two Ancient Jokers work, particularly for heart cards. Each Ancient Joker provides a 1.5 multiplier per scored heart card, meaning with both, each heart card gives a x2.25 multiplier. My goal with Splash is to have all five played cards as hearts, which significantly boosts the multiplier. While leveling a flush gives me a +2 multiplier, it requires five of the same suit, which is more challenging than pairs. However, with Splash, if I go for a flush, that's still a valid hand type.\n**Assessing flush challenges**\n\nI’m considering how challenging it might be to assemble a flush without discards. The deck might have plenty of hearts, but since the Ancient suit changes at the end of each round, I can't fully rely on hearts. Each Ancient Joker seems to individually choose suits, but they might select the same for synergy. If they change randomly and differ, that's less advantageous. However, the text suggests they both currently work with hearts, so they may be synchronized for now. It's a bit unclear, though!\n**Developing a card strategy**\n\nMy plan should focus on hand types that can incorporate five cards, especially since Splash counts anyway. I believe flushes are the best option when suits match because using five of the same suit triggers advantageous multipliers. So, I’ll choose Jupiter for a flush. As a second option, perhaps Venus for three-of-a-kind could be viable, but the flush already seems strong. If I can’t find a flush, pairs may work too, although enhancing pairs might be trickier. For a worst-case scenario, I’ll go with Mercury for pairs to strengthen my hand.\n**Weighing hand choices**\n\nI'm realizing that Venus offers a +2 multiplier and +20 chips, making three-of-a-kind a strong option for improvement. Let me break down the increments: leveling a pair adds +15 chips and +1 multiplier, while three-of-a-kind boosts to +70 chips with a 7 multiplier. This is great for scoring with Ancient multipliers! We might often make three-of-a-kind, and since I can find them in an 8-card hand, it seems feasible. I think I should go for Jupiter and Venus to maximize my strategy, focusing on both peak multipliers and consistency. Selecting Jupiter first makes sense, then I'll choose Venus next.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
