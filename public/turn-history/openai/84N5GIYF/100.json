{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the best way to approach this game. The big blind skip tag in the economy doubles money up to $40, but with just a $1 bet, I only gain $2. It might be better to play smaller bets to earn a bit more plus leftover hands. The meteor tag is valuable since it could level key hands, but I have the Planet Merchant already. The free Mega Celestial pack could provide useful cards, but I need to balance my spending carefully!\n**Considering gameplay strategy**\n\nI can usually win in one hand, which might give me around $3 extra if I start with four hands. If I ante $5, I could have four hands, potentially yielding more than $3 total for purchases. However, I could lose the meteor pack if I skip small bets. Instead, I could play big after taking the meteor, which would give me $5 plus leftover hands. Also, I’d still need 16,500 chips, but since I scored 36,000 last round, I should be fine. Getting free Mega Celestial later seems valuable too!\n**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nOur money is a bit low, but I think we can recover by playing big against the boss. The boss weakens spades, which isn’t really relevant. It seems best to skip the small bet to get the meteor tag since my build is strong, and I want the Mega Celestial pack, which is significant. Playing small for just $3 seems less important right now. I’ll need to decide the order for reshuffling the jokers before deciding how to play. Definitely want to figure this out!\n**Optimizing joker order**\n\nThe Ancient Joker states that each played card with a Club suit gives a 1.5 multiplier when scored, and I see that these activate in order from left to right. So played cards score left to right, triggering base chips, card modifiers, and \"on-scored\" jokers. This means placing Scholar to the left of the Ancients is optimal. The Hanging Chad is a retrigger joker that activates later, but its order doesn't matter. I think we should set the order as Scholar, Ancient, Ancient, Splash, and Chad. I'm curious if placing Chad before the Ancients changes anything!\n**Deciding on action strategy**\n\nI realize that retriggering occurs after the on-scored jokers, and during each scoring round, all on-scored jokers activate from left to right, no matter their positions. The Chad joker triggers after the first card scores, but since we only have one retriggering joker, its position doesn't matter much. The Splash joker makes every played card count, which is significant because in Balatro, usually, only the best hand scores. With Ancient, more Clubs score, which gives a 1.5 multiplier for each. So, I think skipping this round is the best action to take!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
