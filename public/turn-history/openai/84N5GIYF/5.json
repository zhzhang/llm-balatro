{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m in a shop after a big blind win, and I've got some decisions to make. I have a Luchador and the shop is offering a Loyalty Card and a couple of boosters. I need to plan for ante 1 boss. I’m wondering if selling the Luchador before the boss starts will disable the current boss blind, but it looks like I can't do that since there’s no active boss now. I should keep it for now and think about score scaling. I want jokers early, especially since Loyalty bonuses only kick in every six hands.\n**Considering shop options**\n\nIt looks like I have five remaining hands before the Loyalty Card bonus triggers, but then it resets after six more. That’s decent. I’m weighing my options between the buffoon pack for immediate scoring and the celestial pack for leveling up flushes, which could increase my base chips. I also have $10 to spend. If I buy the Loyalty and buffoon, I'll have $1 left, but buying the buffoon and celestial or just one of them seems appealing too. I think I’ll go for the buffoon pack first to get that scoring joker. I wonder if we get prompted after buying the booster or if I just need to use the buy_booster command.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m thinking about whether to choose the buffoon pack early on. If the buffoon turns out to be underwhelming, I can still buy the Loyalty Card later, which should remain in the shop after buying a booster. The order of purchase is tricky. The celestial pack could help me get a rare flush planet like Jupiter, which would be nice. But, since I’m already reliant on flushes, leveling that up might be smarter. I could buy both buffoon and celestial with my $10, leaving $2 afterward, but that would reduce future interest from remaining funds.\n**Planning for the boss encounter**\n\nI’m considering buying the buffoon pack, but it will leave me with only $6. I might just get $1 interest after the boss round, but I need to build my resources for the boss blind, which is likely around 600. I currently lack strong scoring jokers, except for the Luchador, which doesn’t help much. The buffoon will give me something, and the celestial pack might help raise my flush level. I wonder if I can disable the boss effect by selling the Luchador during the encounter.\n**Finalizing the purchase**\n\nIt turns out the boss isn’t active yet, so I can’t disable any effects right now. Since I need immediate support for when the boss appears, I think it’s best to go ahead and buy the Buffoon pack. I’ll use the buy_booster command to make that purchase now. It's important to get the right resources for the challenge ahead, and the Buffoon should help with that!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
