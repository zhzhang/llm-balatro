{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m currently in a shop looking at my poker situation: ante 6, round 10, with $8 on the line. I've got a Jokers full and need to improve my scaling. The shop has some interesting items like The Chariot tarot and a Pluto planet card, but I can't afford the $10 voucher. \n\nI'm considering my current build, which involves a pair/flush with Splash. It seems like playing five spades would be substantial, especially since my strategy typically utilizes five cards with Splash.\n**Refining my strategy**\n\nIt turns out that with Splash, every played card counts towards scoring, but I might still want to hold the steel card unplayed for that x1.5 multiplier. This leads me to consider playing only four cards to keep the steel card in hand. I can still make pairs or trips with four cards. However, playing five cards maximizes the benefits of Splash because it adds chips and triggers ancients. \n\nThe Pluto card can improve my high card level, but it seems better to focus on my current pair level instead of buying it.\n**Assessing booster pack options**\n\nI’m looking at the Jumbo Buffoon booster pack, which costs 6, allowing me to choose up to 4 jokers. While I could find a better joker, I’d need to sell one to make space. Maybe a strong xmult joker could replace one of my current cards, but I'm leaning on keeping Splash and Double Ancient as core elements. \n\nScholar only shines with aces, and Hanging Chad can retrigger valuable cards. Selling Scholar for a better joker makes sense. I could also buy the Chariot for $3, but since I have no consumable slots, I'll need to add it to my consumables inventory.\n**Considering steel card selection**\n\nWhen using steel, I need to select a card from my hand. It makes sense to choose a card I often keep, ideally one with a high rank. However, since steel doesn't score and might accidentally get drawn, I should consider selecting a card with less utility, like the 2 of spades. \n\nIt’s better to choose a low-value card that I won’t mind holding. I can buy The Chariot now for my consumables, and with my remaining $5, I could consider rerolls or a booster, but it looks like I can’t afford the buffoon pack after that purchase.\n**Planning my purchases**\n\nI’m weighing my options: should I buy the Jumbo Buffoon booster pack first or go for The Chariot? The Buffoon pack costs 6, leaving me with $2, which isn't enough for Chariot. Since Chariot seems like a guaranteed value, maybe I should reroll to find a planet or voucher instead. \n\nHaving $8 means buying Chariot for $3 is a solid choice, leaving me with $5 for rerolls later. However, Buffoon could upgrade a joker, potentially replacing Scholar or Hanging Chad. I need to decide whether to sell Scholar for that, as it could benefit from a better joker if the Buffoon offers one. I think it’s best to buy The Chariot first to secure my core values, and then I can think about rerolls or booster packs later.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
