{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about the order of jokers and how they're scored left-to-right for multiple jokers. If an Ancient triggers x1.5 when a suit card is played, the order shouldn’t matter due to the commutative property of multiplication. The Tribe and Spare seem to be independent, triggered later, so again, order is irrelevant. I need to prepare for a round to play flush, focusing on hearts for this one. Since the Ancient Joker suit changes after each round, I can use Sun during the round if I lack hearts. Time to start the round!\n**Preparing output format**\n\nI need to prepare to output JSON for the action of play_round. This means I'll specify all necessary parameters and ensure it’s formatted correctly for easy understanding. I'll make sure it captures the key details needed for this action while staying clear and concise. My focus will be on getting the structure right so that it’s easily readable and functions as intended in the game. Let's get this organized and ready to go!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
