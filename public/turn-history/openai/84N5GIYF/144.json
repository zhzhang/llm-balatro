{"reasoning":"**Calculating scoring process**\n\nI'm figuring out how the scoring works. Each heart scored is multiplied by 1.5 twice, which totals 2.25, along with any modifiers from cards. It's important to manage the order: I add chips first, then apply card modifiers like a +4 multiplier, and finally handle jokers from left to right. For the KH scoring, I start with adding chips, then apply the +4 multiplier, and then multiply by the modifiers again. I realize I need the initial chips set correctly, starting at 80.\n**Detailing scoring process for KH**\n\nI'm walking through the scoring process for the KH card. First, I add 10 chips, bringing my total to 90. I increase the multiplier by 4 to get 14, then apply the Ancient cards, multiplying by 1.5 twice, which brings my multiplier to 31.5. When I retrigger the KH, I add chips again and continue to adjust the multiplier each time. After processing the next few hearts, it seems I'm significantly increasing my chips and multiplier before moving on to Steel Jack, which provides an additional boost.\n**Finalizing scoring and estimating**\n\nI’ve multiplied my score to get a total of about 7254.98. Now, with the independent jokers, the Ancient has already activated, so I need to evaluate others. The Tribe triggers a x2 multiplier due to having a flush, bringing my total multiplier to 14509.97. To calculate my final chips, I multiply my chips (137) by this multiplier and estimate around 1.99 million chips, which exceeds my expectations! I'll go ahead and choose a flush as my intended hand type and structure my response in JSON.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
