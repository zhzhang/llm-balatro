{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nIf I play 3 spades and 2 hearts but don’t have a flush, it won't trigger any bonuses. Starting with a flush hand at level 4 gives me some base multipliers. The Tribe acts as an independent joker and doubles multipliers if a flush is scored, activated after scoring. I want to reach 75k with the fewest hands possible, and I have 4 hands left with 2 discards available. My current hand has three queens and potential pairs, but I can only play 5 cards.\n**Maximizing multipliers**\n\nI want to maximize my multipliers by including the spades I’ve played. I’m thinking of keeping the steel card, 4♥, in my hand to boost my multiplier while it’s held, since it gives a x1.5 multiplier when not played. If I discard it, it could create a Tarot card for me, but I only have room for one more Tarot after using The Sun. I could try for a spade flush, but I only have 3 spades. I could discard non-spades to draw more cards.\n**Calculating probabilities**\n\nI’m thinking of discarding 5 non-spade cards to keep Q♠, J♠, and 4♠, then drawing 5 new cards. With 9 spades left in a deck of 32 cards, if I discard the non-spades, I’ll have 27 cards remaining but still keep the spade count at 9. The probability of drawing at least 2 spades can be calculated using hypergeometric distribution. After crunching the numbers, it looks like the chances aren’t fantastic, but I might try this strategy twice with my remaining discards for a better shot.\n**Rethinking strategy**\n\nI’m considering that maybe I don't need a flush to reach 75k; pairs or three of a kind could suffice, especially with Ancient multipliers. I remember past pair hands scoring 76k and 58k, and with my current setup involving 2 Ancients, I think I can make it work. I’ll calculate the expected chips for a hand like three of a kind with queens, incorporating spades and multiplier cards. For instance, playing Q♠, Q♥, Q♦, plus J♠ and K♥, should yield solid scores from enhancements and spade triggers.\n**Optimizing scoring order**\n\nI'm considering the best strategy for my hand by making the first card a spade, likely Q♠, to take advantage of the Hanging Chad retriggers. This allows for heightened scoring since all played cards will count. With the ancients multiplying totals, I want to assess the order closely, especially with K♥ adding a +4 multiplier. While the goal is to maximize multipliers, having the first card as a spade is crucial. \n\nI could opt for a combination of three of a kind or aim for a flush. However, we need to be strategic about discards and potential draws to achieve optimal scores that exceed 75k. I want to ensure I balance having powerful cards while getting enough spades and considering that my hand type can influence final decisions. I believe my multipliers will be impactful given how I arrange my cards.\n**Calculating hand scoring**\n\nI'm piecing together the chip values for my hand with Splash. It looks like the total comes to 180 chips, factoring in base hand chips and additional card values. The scoring process is crucial, and even holding the steel 4♥ for a multiplier could push my score above 75k, potentially reaching 78,480. \n\nI’m debating the arrangement of my cards to maximize multipliers while keeping the three queens intact. Adding 4♠ might improve my spade multiplier, but I'd lose K♥'s enhancement benefits. After considering spade multipliers and retriggers, I believe playing my highest chip spade first might give me a better chance of getting a strong final score!\n**Finalizing play order**\n\nI want to confirm that I've ordered my hand correctly to maximize my play. I could just specify the play indices, but it feels safer to rearrange my hand first, putting Q♠ and 4♠ in the right positions. Current order is Q♠, J♠, 4♠, and I think I can manage without rearranging them since the order won’t affect the total score.\n\nMy base chips are 110, and after calculating the multipliers and card contributions, I'm estimating a final score of about 165,561. So, I'm ready to send the play action with a \"three of a kind\" hand.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,5,8]"}
