{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a purchase**\n\nI have $6 and no shop cards, which limits my options. I could buy either the standard or celestial booster pack. Rerolling costs $1 and will only reveal jokers or consumables since there are no cards available. Considering I need planets for my collection and the celestial pack guarantees planets, that might be the better choice. The standard pack is less crucial since I have strong multipliers already. Given the risks, I'll likely opt for the Jumbo Celestial pack to improve my hand levels.\n**Weighing rerolls versus purchasing**\n\nIt seems like my strategy revolves around my current pair, which is already level 6. Rerolling the shop could help me find better jokers like Blueprint or Brainstorm. However, with just $6, I might reroll multiple times without finding anything worthwhile. Considering that I'm facing a boss soon, having immediate power from the celestial pack might be more useful. The standard pack could add clubs and maximize Ancient effects, but if the suit changes each round, I'm unsure. I need to think carefully about which option will benefit me more.\n**Choosing to purchase the celestial pack**\n\nGetting more clubs could be beneficial for the upcoming hands against the boss. However, the standard pack only offers one card, so I can't guarantee it will give me what I need. The celestial pack adds chips and multipliers to hand types, which is always useful. Since I'm already getting over 58k with my current pair, that should be enough for the ante 6 boss, but I'm unsure about the exact thresholds. I think it’s best to strengthen my hand by buying the celestial pack, so I’ll go ahead and do that.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
