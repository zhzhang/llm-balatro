{"reasoning":"**Analyzing retrigger mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about how the retriggers work, especially with the Hanging Chad retrigger playing the first card two more times. So, it’s essentially a joker that can trigger the first played scoring card again, but I need to clarify how the order of jokers affects this, particularly if there’s only one. Also, the Splash joker seems to have its own independent status in calculating scores. This could modify which cards score, and it raises questions about placement and influence in retriggers.\n**Considering card mechanics and actions**\n\nIt seems safe to keep the Splash joker last since it may not need to activate early. If it’s independent, it might influence scoring after the fact, but that could modify the rules of which cards score. Keeping it last feels like a good approach. Ancient suits might currently include hearts, so that’s something to note. I’m thinking about playing a round, but it’s also important to consider selling. For now, it seems best to play the boss for a potential payout. I’ll respond with the action in JSON format.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
