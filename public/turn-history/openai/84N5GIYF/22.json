{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game decisions**\n\nI need to decide whether to play or skip the small blind for a coupon tag at the next shop, which would be free. If I skip the small blind, I'll get the tag, but I'll lose the chance for a $3 reward and miss a shop opportunity. By skipping, I go straight to the big blind without shopping in-between. However, playing small might allow me to win and gain some chips, but my current balance is zero. So, I'll need to strategize carefully.\n**Considering coupon strategy**\n\nI might need the coupon tag for free jokers or packs, but skipping the small blind means I won't earn $3 and will face the big blind needing 1200 chips without a shop opportunity. I think that’s doable with ice cream, maybe in 1-2 hands. However, if I win the big blind, I would get $4 and use the coupon for free initial cards or packs. On the downside, I lose the chance to shop after skipping, but skipping saves hands, so ice cream won’t decay then. I just need to ensure I can beat the big blind!\n**Calculating chip potential**\n\nWith ice cream and a flush, I’m looking at a potential of 140 chips plus around 40 from card ranks, totaling 280 chips. I then consider multipliers, which trigger on diamond suit cards only. For each scored diamond, there’s a 1.5 multiplier. If I can play a 5-card diamond flush, the base multiplier is 4, and with 5 cards, I’m getting a final multiplier of about 30.375. Since each scored card equals its rank in chips, I could average 40 more chips for a total of 175.\n**Summarizing chip calculations**\n\nChips accumulate from base chips, card chips, and extra sources, which gives me a total of 175. Multiplying that by the 30 multiplier leads to a huge potential of 5250 chips! Even if not all cards are diamonds, it’s still considerable. Facing a big blind of 1200 and a boss of 1600 should be manageable. Skipping the small blind for the coupon tag seems like the best option since the suit won't change, allowing me to maintain the diamond advantage going into the big blind.\n**Deciding on gameplay strategy**\n\nI realize that I’ll need to play the big blind, and if I beat that, I can access free items at the shop to strengthen my position. Given everything, I believe skipping the small blind is the right move. This way, I can focus on the big blind and prep for the next actions. Skipping the round seems like a strategic choice that keeps me moving forward without losing opportunities!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
