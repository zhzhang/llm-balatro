{"reasoning":"**Weighing game strategies**\n\nIt seems like for Ante 1, the boss \"discards 2 random cards per hand played.\" Selling now could prevent facing that boss soon, but we would lose the joker slot. Selling might not gain us anything, perhaps just a $1. In Balatro, selling gives back half cost, but here it seems $0. The effect of selling triggers regardless, so if it disables the boss, that's good. I think buying some boosters like the Celestial pack for $10 to level up a hand type is a better option.\n**Deciding on game purchases**\n\nI’m considering the options for the flush planet, which is \"Jupiter.\" The Celestial pack gives me one of three planets right away, so I might take Jupiter or Saturn. Early on, leveling the flush will be helpful. There’s also the option of buying the Buffoon pack for a scoring joker. Although the voucher to reroll surplus seems tempting, spending all the money early might not be wise. \n\nI'll get the free Luchador first and then consider buying the Buffoon pack and the Celestial pack, leaving me with $2. I think I'll buy Luchador first, then boosters later.\n**Choosing to buy Luchador**\n\nOkay, it looks like I’m settling on buying Luchador. Since it’s a free option, it makes sense to snag it! This should help me while planning the next steps in the game. I still need to think about the boosters afterwards, but for now, getting Luchador is a solid choice. Let’s take that action and see how it plays out for my strategy moving forward!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
