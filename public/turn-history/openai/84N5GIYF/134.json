{"reasoning":"**Analyzing hand classifications**\n\nI’m considering the position of \"Splash\" among jokers and its effect on card counts. It's looking like \"Splash\" might modify card counts in a distinct way, possibly making it independent in a certain category. The order in category 5 could be \"Splash,\" then \"The Tribe,\" and so on. However, maximizing points is essential. I'm pondering if having a \"Flush\" affects hand types, specifically if a Pair can also contain a Flush with \"Splash\" in play.\n**Determining hand types**\n\nI’m defining what it means for a scored hand to contain another hand type, like when playing five hearts with a pair. In poker, a Flush actually beats a Pair, so the hand type should be Flush. Although flushes have a higher base multiplier, pairs yield more chips. However, with the Ancient Joker’s multiplier, a Flush becomes much stronger due to the boost each heart gets. The Tribe also doubles the multiplier for flushes, making them the preferable aim over pairs.\n**Considering deck strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how our deck may not be suit-focused since the ancient suit changes each round. Right now, it's Hearts, which means aiming for heart flushes can yield huge multipliers. While Splash ensures all played cards score, during a flush, all five already do anyway. However, for a Pair strategy, Splash is beneficial as it allows additional hearts to count towards scoring, even if they aren't part of the Pair. Since I have $0, the best move is to proceed with round selection.\n**Evaluating selling options**\n\nI’m considering selling a consumable or joker to generate some cash. Even though I have $0, selling something could let me buy the Emperor or Hallucination. The Chariot sells for $1, which isn't enough, and Splash also only fetches $1. Selling the Hanging Chad for $2 or the Tribe for $4 could potentially help, but with the Wraith, my economy is already low. If I sell the 8 Ball, I could get $5 but lose a joker slot. Currently, I have 6 jokers, so I need to think carefully about this!\n**Evaluating selling the 8 Ball**\n\nI’m weighing the decision to sell the 8 Ball. It could raise $5 for buying cards like Emperor or Hallucination, but it also generates some tarot. Selling it means I'd lose an extra joker slot, going from 6 to 5, which might limit my options if I find a better joker later. However, with $0 right now, selling it could help me make better purchases. I could also sell the Chariot for more flexibility. Ultimately, I’m leaning toward keeping the 8 Ball for its tarot generation potential and joker slot.\n**Deciding on options in the shop**\n\nI'm weighing whether to buy the Emperor now, considering it would occupy a slot but create up to 2 tarots if I'm able to free more slots later. Selling the 8 Ball for $5 would allow me to buy the Emperor for $3, which seems like a good move, despite losing a joker slot. However, I could also proceed to the next round with $0, potentially winning some cash. In the end, I think it’s better to hold the 8 Ball for now and just continue to play.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
