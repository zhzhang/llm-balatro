{"reasoning":"**Evaluating drawing rules**\n\nThe phrase \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\" seems incomplete. I think it should be something like \"1 in 7 cards are drawn face down\" or perhaps \"all 7 cards are drawn face down.\" Actually, \"The Fish\" draws cards face down. So, maybe it’s best to say, \"All cards get drawn face down.\" Regardless, our scoring is strong at 4981 with a threshold of 1600, so we should win easily. I’ll proceed with the action to play_round, though I’m considering selling the invisible joker, which isn't ready yet.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
