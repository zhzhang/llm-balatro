{"reasoning":"**Analyzing strategy risks**\n\nI’m considering the value of max jokers, particularly with a cap of 5. In the negative edition of Balatro, having a negative can allow an increase in the joker limit. However, I'm weighing risks like skipping small means no money gain or chances to earn interest, while strong chips needed are high for small and big. Skipping might set up a free negative joker in the next shop, but I must remember I’ll face challenges with limited funds afterward. Skipping small seems like a good move, but I need to think through the impending risks of less money for big and boss.\n**Clarifying gameplay strategy**\n\nIf I skip the small, I go directly to the big blind select and, if I win, I can shop before facing the boss. So, there will still be a shop after beating big, just not after small. The negative tag applies to that shop, giving me a free negative joker, which is great! I can also rearrange jokers during blind select. I think the optimal order should be to trigger Scholar before Ancient for better scoring, so the sequence should be Scholar, Ancient, Ancient, Hanging Chad, and then Splash.\n**Confirming joker order**\n\nI need to confirm if Hanging Chad triggers before or if it’s a retrigger joker. It states that it retriggers the first played card used in scoring two additional times. So, if that's independent, it might trigger during the retrigger phase, but maybe not within scored jokers. Regardless, it seems the order may not matter much after all. Alright, I’ll stick with the plan and go ahead to skip the small.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
