{"reasoning":"**Evaluating heart strategies**\n\nI currently have only 2 hearts and need 3 more to make 5. If I discard 5 non-heart cards, I can draw 5 new ones, which gives an expected 1.625 hearts from those. That's not sufficient. I wonder if I can cycle using multiple discards. Another idea is to play a pair or three-of-a-kind with hearts, like a pair of 6s and including a 9H. However, only the pair contributes to scoring, so I need to ensure I maximize my hand effectively.\n**Considering scoring strategies**\n\nSo, I can't make a flush. If I want to leverage the 9H, I need to incorporate it into a scoring set, but not as a pair of nines. Could I discard cards to aim for more hearts or another 9? It seems tricky since I only need 24k to win. A simpler option could be playing a high card with 9H as the highest, avoiding higher cards like A or Q. I find that with a combination of lower cards, this could still work out to gather enough chips!\n**Calculating scoring multipliers**\n\nSo with the Chad retrigger, each scoring card triggers three times, adding +12 to the total multiplier. That starts from a base of 3, which brings the total up to 15. Each heart card, including the 9H, scores with a multiplier of x1.5. Since it's retriggered three times, I get a total of x1.5^3, which is 3.375. If both ancients are active, the multiplier could jump to x1.5^6, equaling 11.39, but I wonder if any abilities might be disabled, affecting my final score.\n**Assessing multipliers and chips**\n\nCurrently, it looks like all abilities are disabled, meaning the secondary x1.5 multiplier won’t apply. Ignoring that, if I just have one ancient, the final multiplier becomes 15 * 3.375, leading to 50.6. That results in only 1,720 chips, which isn't enough. With two ancients, the multiplier rises to 170.9, yielding 5,811 chips, still well short of the needed 24k. Maybe I need a flush or a strong three-of-a-kind or pair, like a pair of 6s to maximize my chips effectively.\n**Planning for a winning hand**\n\nOkay, so with my current hand's abilities disabled, I need to focus on other strategies. I see I can discard non-hearts to increase my chances of getting hearts, aiming for a flush since that would maximize my score. With 2 hearts already, I think I should keep those and discard 5 non-hearts to draw 5 new cards. I estimate about a 20% chance of getting enough hearts, but I have 5 discards, so I can draw again if needed. My main goal is to score at least 24k, perhaps by creating strong pairs or three-of-a-kinds if the flush doesn't work out.\n**Preparing for the next hand**\n\nI’m calculating my chip totals: starting with a base of 100 plus contributions from my pair, that's 36 from two 9s, totaling 136. Multiplied by 512 gives 69,632 chips, but with one ancient, I'm only up to around 13k, which isn't enough. Since Tribe is inactive and Spare is disabled for this hand, I really need to focus on making a flush or playing a pair of hearts. I think I’ll discard 5 non-hearts to draw more hearts and see if I can make a strong hand!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,5,6,7,8]"}
