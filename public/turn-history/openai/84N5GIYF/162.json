{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI've been thinking about the Wasteful discard mechanic, which allows for managing discards effectively over time. For bosses, I might prefer focusing on building a strong flush. Mystic Summit offers a flat +15, but I'd have to replace a joker, which seems questionable compared to Tribe and Spare's multipliers. I can't drop Ancients, as they significantly amplify effects. I need to compare Mystic’s additive benefits and consider the multipliers carefully for an optimal outcome. Let's calculate the approximate effect with a flush of 5 hearts.\n**Analyzing multipliers and effects**\n\nI'm considering the multiplier sources for my strategy and noticed that there aren’t many options aside from some multipliers like 9H Mult +4. Mystic Summit would add +15 to the multiplier if there are zero discards left. This seems to activate independently after scoring, not influenced by the joker triggers. I realize Mystic's effect doesn’t multiply with Ancient effects since it occurs afterward. So, I'll ensure this additive gain from Mystic isn’t miscalculated in relation to my current multipliers during gameplay.\n**Calculating multipliers and scoring events**\n\nIt seems that if Ancients provide their multiplier first, then Mystic adds +15 afterward to an already multiplied total. Tribe’s x2 and Spare’s x1.5 also function independently at the end. To approximate the final multiplier, I'll consider the base multiplier of 10 plus any multipliers from cards, and then apply the Ancient multipliers alongside Tribe and Spare multipliers.\n\nWith 5 hearts, the first scoring card retriggers twice, leading to a total of 7 scoring events. Each event triggers both Ancients, so I need to account for that boost. It looks like the Ancient multiplier ends up being approximately x291.9.\n**Calculating total multipliers**\n\nI'm breaking down the multipliers: Tribe provides x2, while Spare offers x2.25, leading to a substantial total multiplier of base multiplier times 291.9, then multiplied by both Tribe and Spare. \n\nWith the base multiplier for a flush set at 10, I need to consider a 9 hearts multiplier card adding +4. This happens during the scoring phase, and it combines before the Ancients trigger. The sequence is essential since we can choose the order of played cards, allowing earlier multipliers to benefit from later Ancient triggers.\n**Evaluating strategy and resources**\n\nI'm weighing the multipliers and considering how to optimize my scoring and resources. The base multiplier is around 10-30, and adding +15 at the end seems negligible compared to larger multipliers. If I replace Tribe with Mystic, the final multiplier decreases significantly, suggesting it's not worth it.\n\nI also have to think about my remaining chips and whether to reroll for better options like Jupiter or buy Saturn. Ultimately, optimizing the order of jokers is vital for effective scoring, especially since retriggering jokers have specific timing in relation to scoring events.\n**Clarifying retrigger mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about how the retrigger mechanics work. When a card retriggers, it scores again, including on-scored jokers in their left-to-right order. The placement of jokers in the retrigger group matters, but the order of Ancients is irrelevant since they’re both multiplicative.\n\nCurrently, it seems that my options for gaining additional multipliers from Spare or Mystic Summit aren't worthwhile. So, my next action will be to proceed with the round selection for the boss fight, but first, I'll prepare the JSON for it.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
