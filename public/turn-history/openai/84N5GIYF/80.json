{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m considering a strategy for a blind select game where I'm at the small blind with 5000 chips. There's a tempting choice to skip and get a free rare joker, which could replace a weaker joker. The catch is that if I skip, I won’t visit the shop until after the next blind. However, this tag ensures that the shop will have a rare joker available next. Overall, it seems like a good move!\n**Weighing potential outcomes**\n\nI’m caught between the decision to skip the small blind. Skipping would mean losing $3, and with only $4 left, cash is tight. However, I know I’ll earn from my Cloud 9 at the end. The free rare joker holds high value, and I believe I can beat the small blind easily. If I skip, I'll still have an opportunity to shop after the big blind. Ultimately, I need to consider if fewer cash and shop chances outweigh the benefits of the rare joker.\n**Assessing the ante strategy**\n\nAt ante4, I'm thinking scaling may be necessary. The free rare joker could be valuable, but missing a shop could also be costly. We hesitated to buy the crafty joker and Earth due to low funds. Playing the small blind could earn me $3 and open up a shop with potential new items. However, since I have $4, I need to weigh the benefits of immediate rewards from playing versus skipping, which wouldn't provide any end-of-round income. Playing small could significantly boost my funds!\n**Choosing gameplay strategy**\n\nI'd prefer to play, since opting for the Meteor tag on the big blind could potentially offer a mega celestial pack, which might be more advantageous than a rare joker. However, if I skip the big blind, I'd have to face the boss without the shop beforehand, which isn't ideal since the boss has no discards. Skipping might allow me to face the boss and access the pack later, but it adds risk. So, it seems wiser to play both small and big blinds, which leads me to select play_round for the small blind action.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
