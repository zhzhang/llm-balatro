{"reasoning":"**Considering purchases for strategy**\n\nI have $5 left. I’m weighing my options: I could buy an Arcana pack for $4 or reroll, but the Jumbo Celestial pack is $6, which is out of reach unless I buy Mercury first. If I choose to buy the Jumbo pack, I’ll have $2 left, which doesn’t allow for additional purchases. However, getting the Jumbo pack might give me useful options like Mercury among others, even though it’s random.\n**Evaluating strategy for upcoming challenges**\n\nMercury gives a significant boost with +15 chips, increasing the base chips from 55 to 70 at level 4 for pairs, which is really impactful. With $5 left, I could buy an Arcana pack for $4 to enhance my deck with tarot cards, potentially boosting hearts or clubs. However, this would require immediate use, and the upcoming boss debuffs all Spade cards, which poses a risk, especially for my Scholar Ace of Spades. It seems like the next challenge will be quite tough!\n**Clarifying game mechanics with debuffed cards**\n\nOur deck contains some Spades, but I can avoid playing them thanks to Splash. I’m realizing that when Spades are debuffed, their chip values and enhancements are disabled, yet they can still score? Actually, if a debuffed Ace is played, it doesn't trigger Scholar since its abilities are turned off.\n\nBut wait, Scholar triggers on played Aces when scored, so if the Ace is debuffed, does it still count? I think it might still count as a played card and could contribute to the score, even when debuffed.\n**Analyzing Scholar mechanics and suit conversion**\n\nI believe Scholar triggers based on card rank and scoring, so even if a card is debuffed, it can still be scored. However, its chip values become 0. This means while it won't add chips, it might still count for scoring purposes. I'm also thinking it’s wise to convert Spades to other suits before facing the boss. I've got $5 left, so I can buy an Arcana pack, which might include suit-changing tarots like The Sun or The Moon. That sounds like a good plan!\n**Planning next actions with resources**\n\nI’m considering rerolling the shop for $1, looking for better jokers like Blueprint or Brainstorm, but we can’t afford the more expensive ones. Selling Splash is an option to strengthen our deck, but it’s vital for synergizing with Ancient. I need to get hearts playing to score efficiently. \n\nI think I should buy Mercury first to level up my pair permanently and then the Arcana pack to potentially get suit-changing tarots. I'll go ahead and purchase Mercury for $3 now!\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
