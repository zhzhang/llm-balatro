With 6 spades in hand, a flush seems possible by using 5 of them. The value calculations suggest that I could win a significant amount with this approach. However, after playing a flush, I'll have to replace my play, which could limit my options for the next hands. Strategy is key here!\\n**Analyzing card discarding mechanics**\\n\\nI'm digging into how The Hook discards cards during gameplay, specifically how it reduces my hand size after each hand. It seems to discard 2 random cards after I play, which could leave me with only 6 cards for the next hand selection. I\\u2019m considering whether to sell Luchador to stop this discarding effect, but that would mean losing potential scoring opportunities. Ultimately, it could help maintain my spade flush potential!\\n**Deciding on Luchador's sale**\\n\\nI realize we can play a flush now, but I\\u2019m worried about the random discards potentially removing important drawn cards. With three hands left, there\\u2019s still a chance to win. However, selling Luchador to disable The Hook's annoying effect might be wise. I can rebuild later and buy a new joker. Selling now for $2 raises my total to $4, making it easier to get those flushes or straights without the hassle!\\n**Finalizing actions for Luchador**\\n\\nI\\u2019m realizing that if I don\\u2019t sell Luchador now, I\\u2019ll lose the opportunity since it\\u2019s single-use against the current boss. It doesn\\u2019t have any value beyond cash, so selling is strictly beneficial. I\\u2019ll go ahead and choose to sell it now to disable the boss and gain some funds. After that, I can play my flush. I need to output this in the required JSON format, so I'll specify the action clearly!\\n\\nCommand: sell_joker 1\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 16]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Drunkard.

Drawing for a 4-of-a-kind with 6s seems tricky too since there's only 1 six left in the deck, giving me about a 19% chance. Maybe my best immediate play is to work with the three of a kind 6s, potentially yielding 144, and build a flush instead by discarding and hitting to maximize points!\\n**Calculating probabilities for draws**\\n\\nI need to figure out my chances with the current cards. With only 3 clubs in the deck, keeping 3 clubs and discarding 5 means I have a low 8.5% chance to draw at least 2 clubs in 5 draws, which isn\\u2019t great. I could try keeping hearts instead. If I keep 7\\u2665 and 6\\u2665 and discard the rest, I can calculate a probability of about 15% to draw 3 or more hearts from the remaining 8 in the deck. The spades situation seems similarly tricky.\\n**Exploring potential hands**\\n\\nI\\u2019m calculating the probabilities for my current card situation. It looks like the chance of pulling off a flush with hearts is about 15%, which is pretty appealing. However, I could also stick with my three-of-a-kind and potentially score easier. Discarding non-6 cards could give me a shot at a full house. I\\u2019ll need a pair from the ranks I have left. It seems worth the gamble to try for that full house to maximize my points!\\n**Calculating full house potential**\\n\\nI'm thinking about drawing cards to create a full house. If I keep my three 6s and discard 5 cards, I need to draw at least a pair from the new 5. The idea is that I could also potentially draw another 6, but there\\u2019s only one left, so that's out of the question. My focus is on getting a matching rank to form that pair, which seems like a solid strategy. The probability for finding a rank appearing at least twice should be pretty favorable!\\n**Calculating probabilities for distinct ranks**\\n\\nI'm working through the math to find the probability of drawing 5 distinct ranks from a 26-card hand. After some approximations and using the polynomial method, I calculated that the number of combinations with all distinct ranks is around 29,442. Since the total number of 5-card combinations is 65,780, the probability of getting all distinct ranks comes out to about 44.76%. This also means the chance of having at least one pair is around 55%, which sounds promising for my card strategy!\\n**Deciding on discards for full house**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering using my discards to draw 5 new cards while keeping my three 6s, which could help me form a full house. There's a 55% chance I'll get at least one pair, but even if that fails, I can still play three-of-a-kind. I think it's best to discard 5 non-6s now to preserve my chances while keeping the 6s. So, I'll discard positions 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 to see what I can draw next!\\n\\nCommand: discard 2 3 5 6 8\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Drunkard.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nplay <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Play the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may play up to 5 cards at a time. If you play a hand, you must also respond with the intended hand type you think you are playing, and an estimate of the number of chips you think you will earn from the hand. Use the results of previous hands played to inform your estimate.\\ndiscard <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Discard the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may discard up to 5 cards at a time.\\nrearrange_hand <card1> <card2> ... <cardN> - Rearrange the hand of cards. Every index in the list of current cards must be present, i.e. if there are 5 cards, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\n\\n#Task\\nAnalyze the total game state and context above, and respond with the appropriate action to take next.\"}",

  "reasoning": "**Figuring out chip order**\n\nI'm trying to decide how to score chips from left to right. I wonder if ordering high chips matters much since they're just additive at the base. So, maybe keeping kings and 6's doesn't affect the overall score. I think I'll choose the order 5, 7, 2, 4, and 6, but I must ensure to form a full house. Ultimately, the order for scoring chips itself doesn't matter. Let's go with [2, 4, 6, 5, 7].\n"
