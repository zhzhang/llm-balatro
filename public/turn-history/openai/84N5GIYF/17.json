{"reasoning":"**Figuring out chip order**\n\nI'm trying to decide how to score chips from left to right. I wonder if ordering high chips matters much since they're just additive at the base. So, maybe keeping kings and 6's doesn't affect the overall score. I think I'll choose the order 5, 7, 2, 4, and 6, but I must ensure to form a full house. Ultimately, the order for scoring chips itself doesn't matter. Let's go with [2, 4, 6, 5, 7].\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,4,6,5,7]"}
