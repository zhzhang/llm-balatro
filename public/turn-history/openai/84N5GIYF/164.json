{"reasoning":"**Planning card play**\n\nI'm considering choosing high chip values, like 10D and JD for positions 8 and 7. We need to play 5 hearts and we already have hearts in positions 2, 3, and 4. To convert two others, I'll select cards 8 and 7. The order matters, so I’ll lead with 8H for its multiplier benefits. I’ll set the order as 3 (8H multi), 2 (9H), 7 (J converted), 8 (10 converted), and finally 4 (4H). I'll use consumable Sun on cards 7 and 8.\n**Managing consumables and actions**\n\nI can target up to 3 with Sun, so I’ll use it on 7 and 8 for a flush. I still have 1 consumable slot available, allowing room for another action. My task is to provide the next appropriate action as a single JSON output, which usually means one command per turn. I’ll use Sun first since it's necessary for the flush. So, I’ll proceed with the action to use consumable on 1, 7, and 8.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,7,8]"}
