{"reasoning":"**Considering consumable items**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to use the Sun consumable, particularly if hearts become useful later on. Since it doesn't expire, it might be wise to hold onto it until the suit matches. The Hermit doubles money, but I need to consider its limitations: using it now would give me a minimum of $10. After using it, I'd have the option to buy a Wasteful voucher that increases discards. More discards could mean more chips later, which is valuable.\n**Evaluating Joker lineup**\n\nI've realized that Banner is a Joker, so to get it, I need to sell an existing one since I'm at maximum capacity for jokers. Selling 8 Ball would decrease my max jokers from 6 to 5, but I'd still have 5 if I sell it, allowing me to buy the Banner to return to 6. However, since the negative effect adds a slot, I might be better off keeping 8 Ball and selling either Splash or Hanging Chad instead. Let's look closely at which one is less crucial.\n**Analyzing card synergies**\n\nI'm considering the synergy between Ancient and Tribe when it comes to getting a flush of the correct suit. Tribe actually doubles its effect if I play a hand with any flush, so that's a positive! Hanging Chad can retrigger the first played card for additional points, especially useful if that card has a multiplier. While we have the enhanced King of Hearts in the deck, it would be beneficial to ensure the first card we play has a multiplier to maximize gains. Splash also plays a key role because it counts every card in scoring, which is especially significant for Ancient, but if I focus on flushes, the relevance of Splash decreases.\n**Assessing hand options and slots**\n\nI'm realizing that with only 6 spades in the deck, a spade flush is pretty unlikely. However, I could still play any hand with spades, and Splash ensures those spades count, which is crucial. Now, regarding the 8 Ball: it has a 1/4 chance of creating a tarot card and gives an extra joker slot due to its negative effect. This negative edition gives me an extra slot, adding to my jokers without costing a space. So, keeping 8 Ball seems wise since it helps maintain my slot count.\n**Deciding on card trades and strategies**\n\nTo buy the Banner, I have to sell a Joker that's not 8 Ball since I need a free slot. Tribe could be a candidate, but it offers a strong multiplier if I manage a flush. Banner gives +30 chips per remaining discard—though I'm only likely to start with 2 or 3—making it a solid option. While Tribe needs a flush to activate, Banner can work without it and potentially double my score overall. \n\nAncient relies on spades, which is tricky since I have only 6 spades in the deck. I can often play flushes with my 8-card hand, but I might not consistently get flushes with spades since my deck has more hearts. The Sun could help later if Ancient shifts to hearts, but ultimately, I might consider getting an Arcana pack to modify my deck without needing additional slots.\n**Considering tarot and strategy options**\n\nI need to think about how tarots like World can convert cards, but they require specific targets, which might not work smoothly in the store interface. It seems that I can select from my deck, yet the mechanics aren't clear on whether I can do that as I buy. \n\nGiven my current funds, I can use Hermit to double my money to $10 and then grab a Wasteful voucher. This would grant a permanent +1 discard, enhancing my chance of achieving flushes. \n\nRerolls are also tempting; at $1 each, I could potentially search for powerful jokers or combos. With ante 8 approaching, I want to make sure I optimize my hand with spades yet keep in mind my potential score may drop if I can't trigger ancient bonuses. I must build my deck towards that and consider using arcana packs for valuable tarots.\n**Analyzing consumables and strategy**\n\nWhen I open a pack, it seems like I may need to select targets later, but it’s not entirely clear how this interface works. If I buy a booster, the game might shift to showing available tarots. It’s possible that they might not require actual hand targets when used, just that they can be applied directly from the deck.\n\nGiven my current situation, using The Hermit now to double my funds to $10 seems like the best move, allowing me to buy the Wasteful voucher for +1 discard. This would help me search for spades effectively over the next rounds, which seems very beneficial. I think combining this with the potential of having additional discards will strengthen my strategy going forward!\n**Determining the next action**\n\nAfter using The Hermit, I’ll have $10, the Hermit will be gone, and I’ll be left with the Sun in consumables along with one free slot. My immediate plan is to buy the Wasteful voucher using the buy_voucher command. However, I must focus on one action at a time, so I’ll start by using The Hermit.\n\nI’ll respond with the appropriate action in JSON format, specifying to use the consumable at position [2].\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
