{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategies**\n\nI’m looking at my card options. The combo of \"2 Ancient + Splash\" seems powerful, and there's potential from \"Hanging Chad\" to multiply effects. I’m thinking of selling \"Scholar\" for $2 to create an opening to buy \"Diet Cola\" for $6, but that feels tricky since I'd lose the Scholar effect temporarily. Selling \"Diet Cola\" for a double tag might not yield enough money, maybe around $3? I could reroll the shop instead, but I need to manage my funds wisely!\n**Evaluating shop strategies**\n\nI’m considering our money situation for upcoming shops and weighing whether to hold onto $6 for interest later. Since we’re doing well with Ante 4, we might not need to buy anything immediately. If I save the $6, I can earn interest of $1 for every $5 after beating the next blind. However, I’m also tempted to reroll for a chance at a planet; they might appear more often, and purchasing one would cost about $3, allowing me to keep some money for later!\n**Assessing reroll decisions**\n\nRerolling costs $3, and if I see a planet priced at $3, I can still buy it, leaving me with $3. But if it’s $4, then I’d miss out. Alternatively, just selecting the round could work since we have a strong hand and used \"The Sun\" to upgrade our deck. However, since the shop only has \"Diet Cola,\" it’s tempting to reroll for better options like a tarot or joker. I have to think about the order of jokers too; scoring is determined left-to-right, which could affect my strategy!\n**Analyzing joker effects**\n\nThe Ancient Joker offers a 1.5x multiplier for each played card of its suit when scored, so the order does seem important. Both Ancient Jokers share this effect and can be triggered with Scholar when an Ace is scored. \"Hanging Chad\" allows the first played card to retrigger scoring two extra times, which is great! Ideally, I want that first card to be the Ace of Hearts to maximize all the multipliers, especially if Scholar’s bonus comes before Ancient’s effect. This could lead to stronger overall multipliers for my score!\n**Organizing joker order and actions**\n\nI need to arrange my jokers, placing Scholar first since it boosts multipliers before Ancient's effect. Having \"Hanging Chad\" in the mix means I can retrigger cards, but its order won't matter. I want that tight setup to maximize multipliers while planning my next steps. With the current options, I might want to save money for later rounds, especially since Ante 4 could present tougher challenges. I’ll skip rerolling and choose \"round_select\" instead to keep my $6 for interest!\n**Choosing round_select**\n\nI’ve decided to go for \"round_select.\" This feels like the right move since it allows me to progress in the game while keeping my resources intact. By choosing this option, I can set myself up for the upcoming challenges while possibly gaining additional interest. It’s about making sure I’m prepared for what’s ahead. Plus, I’m feeling good about my current setup, so let’s keep that momentum going!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
