{"reasoning":"**Evaluating selling options**\n\nI'm considering which item to sell. Selling Spare seems tempting at x2.25, but Tribe has its perks at x2. Ancients provide a substantial multiplier, especially if I play 5 hearts. Keeping both ancients is the best strategy, while possibly selling Tribe. Selling Spare is on the table too since they have similar multipliers. I need to run the math for selling decisions and potential replacements with Lusty, comparing final multipliers for each option to maximize my gains.\n**Recalculating Ancient effects**\n\nI'm realizing that Chad increases Ancient triggers, which I need to factor in. Without Chad, ancients have a multiplier of x57.7, but with him, retriggers significantly boost their effectiveness. The first heart retrigger adds extra multipliers, leading to a more complex calculation. With 5 hearts scored, each Ancient yields x1.5^7, resulting in a staggering x291.9 when considering two ancients. I see now that I miscalculated earlier by not including Chad’s effect, so recalculating accurately is necessary!\n**Analyzing multipliers with Chad**\n\nWith Chad's help in retriggering the first card, I see that it leads to 7 scoring events, giving a total multiplier of x17.0859 for each Ancient. This combination results in an enormous x291.93 when using two ancients! Also, Lusty Joker adds +3 multipliers per scored heart, which totals +21 for those 7 events. My current setup has a final multiplier of 10*291.9*2*2.25, giving a massive total of 13,136. Now, I need to decide if I should sell Spare or Tribe to add Lusty.\n**Understanding scoring multipliers**\n\nDuring scoring, I recognize that my base multiplier starts at 10. Then, after scoring hearts, I add +21. The order of Ancient multipliers matters because they apply during scoring along with Lusty's multipliers. I see that Lusty adds +21 that gets further multiplied by Ancients, which complicates the calculations. To simplify, I could treat Lusty's addition first, then apply the multipliers of the Ancients and Tribe/Spare, but I need to accurately simulate the scoring order for clarity!\n**Evaluating Joker replacements**\n\nI'm analyzing the role of Hanging Chad and how it retriggers during scoring, which potentially increases scoring events. I see that the order of jokers matters, particularly Lusty and Ancients. If Lusty is placed before Ancients, it maximizes their effects. While considering dropping either Tribe or Spare to add Lusty, I find that the existing multipliers for those jokers are quite significant. Ultimately, keeping both Tribe and Spare seems valuable, and dropping Chad would still result in lower multipliers. Lusty doesn’t seem strong enough to replace the current multipliers effectively!\n**Analyzing joker configurations**\n\nI'm diving deep into the effects of Spare Trousers and Tribe on multipliers. Spare offers a significant multiplier when combined with polychrome, and I see how Lusty could add benefits, but I'd need to drop another joker to include it. If I only kept one ancient and combined it with Lusty, the multipliers wouldn't hold up well against the two ancients setup. Maintaining my current five jokers seems wise, as dropping Tribe or Spare also results in lower multipliers. Additionally, assessing buying options, possibly acquiring arcana for tarot upgrades looks promising for enhancing my performance against the final boss.\n**Optimizing joker strategies**\n\nI’m analyzing the positioning of my jokers and how they retrigger effects. If I place Chad early, it won't affect scoring order with Ancient jokers. However, having Spare Trousers before Tribe could maximize multipliers if Spare gains a multiplier later. Even though Spare currently adds nothing, it's wise to keep it in front during the final boss if two pairs arise. \n\nBuying the Arcana pack could improve my deck, but I also want to reroll for Jupiter. If I could increase the flush base multiplier, that might help against the boss requirements. Each decision feels crucial right now!\n**Deciding on strategies**\n\nI need a total of five hearts for a flush, which means I'll convert three with the Sun and need two more initially. If the cards don’t pan out for hearts, I could still aim for another suit. Since the ancients currently require hearts and will stay that way for the upcoming boss fight, I need to make sure I draw those hearts. \n\nWhile I could buy a Standard pack to add more chances for hearts, there's also the Arcana pack, which might give me tarot cards like \"The World\" or a second Sun. Given that rerolls are stacking in cost, I'm weighing buying the Arcana pack first and then rerolling. \n\nI think I'll reroll twice to find Jupiter or another key planet, maximizing my chances before deciding on the Arcana pack. Thus, my next action is to reroll in the shop!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
