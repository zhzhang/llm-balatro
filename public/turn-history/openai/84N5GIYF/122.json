{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card purchase strategy**\n\nI’m in a shop with $8, eyeing some cards: the Abstract Joker for $4, and two packs for $6 each. I can’t afford the voucher. My deck strategy focuses on pairing with Splash, Hanging Chad, and two Ancients. With my current jokers, I see I’d gain +3 mult per joker from Abstract. If I buy it, I’ll have 7 jokers, making a total +21 mult afterwards. But right now, the card is showing a +18 mult, so I’m trying to figure out if that includes the Abstract purchase calculation.\n**Deciding on purchases in the shop**\n\nI’m at Balatro shop looking at the Abstract Joker, which offers a +X Mult based on my current joker count times 3. It doesn't count itself, so when I buy it, my joker count goes from 6 to 7, turning the multiplier into +21, which is significant! With my base multiplier at 7 and other bonuses, this adds immensely to my output. After buying the Abstract, I'll have $4 left. I could buy rerolls for $1 to search for planets or consider a Standard pack, but the Celestial pack is too pricey right now.\n**Rethinking joker slots**\n\nI’m considering rerolling twice to find a good joker, but I recognize that I already have 7 joker slots, which seems maxed out at 6. Oh, I remember that the 8 Ball gives me one extra slot, and the negative edition adds another, meaning it technically doesn’t count towards the limit. So, my total slots include +1 for the 8 Ball and +1 from the negative edition. Therefore, it looks like I've increased my capacity from 5 to 6, which is helpful!\n**Clarifying joker slot capacity**\n\nIt seems that the Secondary Description gives me a +1 joker slot, but I'm wondering if the negative edition’s effect isn’t reflected in the maximum count. Typically, the negative edition should increase my capacity but not count toward the limit. Right now, my max is 6, and I already have 6 jokers, including the 8 Ball. So, I apparently can’t buy an Abstract unless the max allows for 7. I need to trust that the \"Max Jokers\" stat shows accurate capacity, which indicates I have no room left.\n**Evaluating joker selling strategy**\n\nI need to sell a joker to make room for the Abstract since my current capacity is full at 6 jokers. The 8 Ball is crucial for its +1 joker slot, but if I sell it, my maximum will drop to 5, which complicates things. I'm considering selling Scholar since it feels less essential without focusing on Aces. While Scholar can provide +20 chips and a +4 multiplier with Aces, I realize my best scores have often involved pairs. So, selling Scholar seems to be the best option to get those jokers in play!\n**Planning next moves**\n\nI need to focus on the next action, which is to sell Scholar for $2 to make space for other purchases. After selling, I'll have $10, enough to buy the Abstract for $4, leaving me with $6. Great! I could potentially buy the Celestial pack for leveling up too. However, I wonder if I should also consider the Overstock voucher for more shop slots. But right now, my main priority seems to be buying the Abstract for its immediate scoring power! So, I’ll go ahead and issue the command to sell Scholar first.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
