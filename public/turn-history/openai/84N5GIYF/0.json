{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI'm considering the choice at the start of the ante1 small blind game. Skipping could grant a free Uncommon Joker, but I'd lose the $3 from the small blind and not have access to the shop right away. However, if I skip, I carry the tag to the next round, which seems worth it. Playing big blind with 450 chips is manageable, especially if I might win the round and then access the shop later. Ultimately, I think I’d skip small for that potential benefit.\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI'm weighing whether to skip the small blind or play it. The shop might not have a good joker, and the free uncommon is worth about $6-8. If I play small, I could buy a common joker, but the early game economy is crucial. Considering the potential value of skipping, I think I’ll choose to skip the small blind. So, it looks like I’m leaning towards skipping the round for now.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
