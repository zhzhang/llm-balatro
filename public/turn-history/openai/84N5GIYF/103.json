{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI’m figuring out the setup for the Ancient Jokers and how they interact with club cards. Since having two Ancient Jokers multiplies the value per card, I think I can get a significant boost for a strong play. I also need to consider the order of the jokers and how they’ll affect the score, with the Scholar providing an additive bonus that I want to apply before the multiplicative bonuses from the Ancients. It’s all about maximizing the multipliers!\n**Evaluating joker order**\n\nI'm looking at how the Hanging Chad and Splash fit into my scoring strategy. The Chad retriggers the first played card during scoring, but it seems like order doesn’t really affect it when I'm using it alongside Splash. Although I initially thought the order matters, I think it's okay to stick with the current setup. Since Splash is more of a passive joker, the cards can stay in the original order without needing to rearrange. I’ll just play the round!\n**Deciding on action**\n\nI need to follow the instructions and choose the appropriate action for the situation. It looks like playing the round is the correct move, so I'll go with that. I have to respond in the right format, specifically in JSON, and I should specify the intended hand type. But at this phase, my only options are to either play the round or skip it. Since “play_round” is the clear choice, I’ll make that my action!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
