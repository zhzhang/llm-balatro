{"reasoning":"**Evaluating scoring strategies**\n\nI’ve already gotten a pair to level 3, which gives +15 chips and +1 to the multiplier—pretty good! I’m considering the three of a kind at level 1; it could use more base power. However, it's harder to play. Our biggest score came from three of a kind at 35,680, possibly boosted by hearts and aces. Increasing the base multiplier with more chips could help, especially since the base multiplier matters more later in the game.\n**Considering three of a kind strategy**\n\nCurrently, three of a kind (3oak) has a base multiplier of 3, which increases to 5 when I add Venus, making it equal to the pair multiplier. The chips also rise from 30 to 50, which is good if I can consistently play 3oak with hearts. However, the requirements aren't always fulfilled. With Splash, I can use three ranks and maybe add more hearts. I wonder about the number of aces left; Scholar suggests they’re crucial, and it's worth aiming for them!\n**Selecting enhancements for gameplay**\n\nI’m considering that pairs are the easiest to play, and I already have a high pair level. It might be worth taking Mercury to enhance pairs further, as I use them often. However, Venus offers a bigger relative gain and can significantly improve scoring hands. I’m leaning toward Venus since the three of a kind (3oak) increases the base multiplier by +2 compared to pair's +1. If I can play 3oak a few times, it could really help! So, I’ll choose Venus for position 2.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
