{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop choices**\n\nI'm in the shop, where I've already bought Splash and boosted 3oak to level 2. I have $10, with Diet Cola at $6 and an Arcana pack at $4. The reroll cost is $3 due to surplus, but might actually be $5. Diet Cola is a joker card, but I'd need to sell another card to buy it. Selling typically nets me about $3, which would leave me with a loss to obtain a Double Tag. Tags can be quite valuable!\n**Evaluating blind options**\n\nSo, we're in round 7, after the small blind, and it's time to decide about the big blind for ante 4. I could choose to skip the big blind, but I'd lose the shop opportunity, heading straight to the boss. Skipping the big blind keeps things in the selection for the next blind without a shop, which feels risky. I’d rather play the big blind to shop before facing the boss. If I buy Diet Cola and sell it, I could get a Double Tag, allowing two tags of the same type if I skip a blind.\n**Considering investment options**\n\nI’m wondering if I should go for a strong investment tag, but it might not be worth losing the shop opportunity. The Arcana pack costs $4, and it could potentially give me tarot cards like The Lovers, which can create or enhance hearts. Currently, the suit is Hearts, and it changes at the end of each round after beating the big blind. With two Ancients, the suit will likely remain the same, so I could exploit the hearts for now before the suit changes!\n**Deciding on card enhancements**\n\nI just realized that The Lovers card can enhance one card into a Wild Card in Balatro. Additionally, The Sun changes up to three cards to hearts, while other tarot cards convert to different suits. So, getting the Arcana pack could really help with suit conversion or card enhancements. Plus, we have a Pluto consumable that boosts a high card, but it might not be super useful. With $10, buying the Arcana pack seems like the best move for heart synergy and scoring potential!\n**Strategizing shop options**\n\nI'm considering whether to reroll the shop for a better joker, but that costs $3, leaving me with $7. If I find a great joker, I might need to sell something else. While my current setup is strong, I also want options like the Bloodstone for scaling. First, it seems wise to buy the Arcana pack to see what tarot cards I get. I need to think about the activation order for jokers, as it influences how the scoring works. I’ll prioritize buying the Arcana!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
