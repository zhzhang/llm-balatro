{"reasoning":"**Considering scoring strategies**\n\nHigh card appears to be a common scoring strategy in our setup, especially if we can start with hearts, which is the suit that Ancient cares about. However, Ancient's suit changes at the end of each round, so we can't always depend on hearts. Adapting by playing the suit is key. High card scaling is consistently useful since I can always play a high card of that suit. While pairs are harder to achieve, high cards seem most reliable, especially since they trigger three times with just one card.\n**Choosing scoring strategies**\n\nThe \"first played card used in scoring\" is an important concept. For pairs, you'd need two cards to score, where the first one retriggers, allowing for more points from that card, which is still a solid option. But high card is definitely the easiest route. Considering Mars for four of a kind might not work, and I think Earth has some improvement for flushes. I'll choose Pluto to strengthen the high card for better fallback hands, positioning it at level two.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
