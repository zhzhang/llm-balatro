{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI see we have an 86% chance of getting at least one heart, which is promising! With a fifth heart, we can play a flush and potentially clear 140k in one hand. If that doesn’t work out, we still have a discard option to try again. I'll discard cards 1, 2, 3, and 8. Plus, using Chariot to create a Steel card could boost our multiplier. Being strategic about card play and hand size is essential. Let's think this through!\n**Deciding on card discard**\n\nI'm thinking about the 8S; it's not a good card to keep, so I'll discard it. It makes sense to wait until after the discards to see which cards remain for the flush attempt. I might want to hold onto the A♣ as Steel to avoid interference. Should I use it after drawing a heart? I need to decide now and plan to discard non-hearts. I'll prepare the output JSON to reflect the \"discard\" action along with the positions list.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,8]"}
