{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot options**\n\nI’m looking at the TAROT_PACK Jumbo Arcana and considering which card to pick from five options. We’ve got Strength, Star, Hermit, Temperance, and Hanged Man. Strength can rank up two cards, and Star converts to diamonds, which doesn’t fit our flush goal. Hermit offers double money, Temperance gives sell value for jokers, and Hanged Man destroys cards. Since we're aiming for hearts and flushes, I think I should avoid Star and consider my options more carefully.\n**Choosing the right tarot card**\n\nI'm considering the Hanged Man to potentially thin the deck to hearts, but we need specific target cards from my hand, which has three hearts and some lower-value cards. I could destroy clubs or diamonds to increase heart density but can only remove two cards. Hermit doubles money, while Temperance provides $12 without removing jokers, which is beneficial for future purchases. So, I think Temperance is the better choice. I’ll go ahead and select the fourth card position.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
