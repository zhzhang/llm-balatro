{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop strategy**\n\nI'm trying to decide what to do next in the shop. I have $5 and a consumable Chariot. In the shop, there's Pluto for $3, but I can't afford the Buffoon/Standard pack at $6 or the Overstock for $10. I could reroll for $1, hoping for a better card, but my current setup is strong with a double Ancient Joker and Splash. To scale effectively, I need to be smart about card plays. I'll weigh my options!\n**Analyzing scoring strategy**\n\nWith my double Ancient, each spade gives me a multiplier of 2.25. That's significant! If I play 5 spades, that results in a huge multiplier of about 57.7 per card, but I need to maximize the number of suited cards to make this work effectively. Holding the steel card might reduce my spade triggers unless I can keep it as a spade. However, it only gives a 1.5 multiplier when held. Losing a spade could cost me triggers and scoring potential, so I should weigh these decisions carefully!\n**Weighing card options**\n\nI’m considering whether I can play 5 cards and still hold onto the steel card if my deck size is larger than 5. The steel card must stay in hand for its multiplier, so I can't play it. There's also Pluto, which offers a high card bonus, but if I'm focusing on pairs or trips, maybe it's not useful right now. I could reroll for $1 to see if there's a better option like a joker. The reroll cost is low, and I can keep trying until my money runs out!\n**Exploring best options**\n\nI'm thinking it might be best to find a useful joker or planet card. However, I already have full joker slots, so if I want a new one, I’ll need to sell an existing joker. I could reroll a few times, maybe up to four tries, or I could buy Pluto to use as a consumable. Buying Pluto would take up my second consumable slot, but I could use it immediately since it doesn’t require a target. That could help level my high card without taking up space!\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI'm considering whether using $3 on Pluto would be worthwhile since it offers a small buff. With our joker scaling, the base multiplier is modest. Increasing it from 3 to 4 gives a decent boost, especially when playing high cards. But since we mostly play pairs, I wonder if it's better to reroll instead and look for a more suitable planet. Rerolls are only $1, so I can try two for now and see what better options might come up. I think the best move is to choose the reroll shop!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
