{"reasoning":"**Planning a purchase**\n\nI’m at the shop after the big blind ante. I have a coupon for a free initial shop and have already bought Hanging Chad and Invisible Joker for $0. There’s still $7 left, and I see some free boosters available. I should open them! Should I buy the Jumbo Arcana first? Typically, arcana can enhance my deck. I think it makes sense to go for the Jumbo Arcana pack first.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
