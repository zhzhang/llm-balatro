{"reasoning":"**Considering long-term strategy**\n\nI’m thinking through the gameplay strategy around shopping and packing after facing the boss. Instead, I could take the big blind to gain $4 and a shop, which might provide a stronger position for the boss encounter. But since we already have enough chips, it’s crucial to focus on long-term scaling; the Mega Celestial pack appears strong. I might also want to rearrange jokers to optimize. The order of jokers affects scoring, so it’s important to understand how they trigger for scoring combos.\n**Optimizing scoring order**\n\nI’m thinking about the order in which to play the cards for optimal scoring. If we have Scholar first, then Ancient, the Scholar will enhance the base multiplier before the Ancients apply their multipliers. If we flip that order, it negatively affects the score. Hanging Chad can retrigger the first played card, but since I only have one of those, it’s crucial to consider its placement carefully. \n\nSplash also plays a role, possibly impacting scoring independently. Rearranging to place Scholar first seems like the best move!\n**Finalizing card order**\n\nIn the game, Splash means that every played card contributes to scoring, and it seems independent concerning order. Hanging Chad falls into the retrigger category, and while its placement doesn't matter as much, its function as a Joker can influence scoring if multiple are present. I think I’ve arrived at an optimal order: Scholar first, followed by Ancients, then Hanging Chad, and finally Splash. So, it seems like I can confidently decide to skip the round!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
