{"reasoning":"**Considering shopping strategy**\n\nI’m at the shop with $8 and some options to buy. I can choose between Rocket for $6, Stuntman for $7, or boosters. We already bought Planet Merchant and Hone, and we have an Ancient Joker suit currently in Diamonds. For the next round, I’m thinking about pursuing a diamond flush. If I buy Stuntman, it’ll reduce my hand size to 6, which could hurt my flush consistency but provides a hefty chip boost.\n**Evaluating purchase strategy**\n\nEarlier, I was thinking about the ante at 3. The Rocket could generate a lot in the long run. If I buy Rocket now, it would fill my last slot, but I still have one empty slot for potential duplication. The Invisible Joker can duplicate after 2 rounds, but getting Rocket now makes it a possible target. Duplicating Ancient would be ideal, but adding more jokers could reduce the chance of that happening. Once I sell Invisible, I'll have about a 1 in 3 chance to duplicate Ancient among the other jokers.\n**Reassessing joker purchase**\n\nIf I buy Rocket now, I’ll have 4 jokers, and after selling Invisible, that gives me a pool of 4 others, which means only a 1 in 4 chance of duplicating Ancient. So, I should probably hold off on buying new jokers until after selling Invisible to improve my chances. Stuntman has great power but could reduce my chance of duplicating Ancient and hurt my hand size, which I need to maintain for flush scoring. I could think about buying booster packs to add a diamond card, but they cost money and won’t impact duplication probabilities.\n**Planning purchases wisely**\n\nI have $8, and I could buy a Jumbo Standard Pack for $6, leaving me with $2, or a Standard Pack for $4, which would leave me with $4. I could also reroll for $5. Given that the Planet Merchant brings more planets to the shop, it makes sense to save money for future shops or rerolls. Keeping my $8 for interest and rerolls seems best, especially to maintain a 1 in 3 chance of duplicating Ancient. I could also strengthen my deck with a Standard Pack, but that would reduce my interest. So, I might consider buying Rocket and selling it later instead.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nIf I buy Rocket now, my chances of duplicating Ancient drop to 1 in 4, which isn't great. The same goes for Stuntman. So, I think it’s best to do nothing and proceed to the next round. Buying a booster pack while keeping at least $5 isn’t advantageous either since I could buy a Standard Pack for $4 or a Jumbo for $6, but I’d be left without interest. It might be better to save my money for future rerolls and actions, so I’ll go with round_select and adjust the order of my jokers for triggers. I want to remember that Ancient triggers with each played card, and the order matters among jokers. So, for now, I’m going to select the round.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
