{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI need to make decisions about purchases with $8 available. The items include The Emperor tarot for $3, Hallucination joker for $4, and more, but the voucher Grabber costs too much at $10. There's a reroll option for $1. My build revolves around the Ancient Joker suit, currently focused on Hearts. I'm considering whether to purchase Hallucination to generate more tarots. The Emperor card takes up a consumable slot—buying it means using it right away. So, should I grab that?\n**Evaluating card purchases**\n\nI’m considering using the Emperor tarot, which can create up to 2 tarots if there's room. I might buy and use it immediately to generate tarots, but I need an empty slot first. I currently have 1 empty slot, so it would only create 1 tarot unless I use the Chariot first. But the Chariot requires a target card, and I can't use it in the shop. Selling the Chariot to free up a slot could work, but it’s valuable for my score. Maybe it's less important given my strong build already.\n**Considering card options**\n\nI’m weighing the benefits of keeping a steel card in hand, which adds a 1.5 multiplier. It's useful but requires me to hold it every turn, and I can always get it later. Buying the Spectral Pack could provide powerful cards like Ankh or Deja Vu, while the Standard Pack might add more clubs to the deck. Currently, my Ancient suit is hearts, giving extra points. Since the suit changes each round, maybe it's better to buy the Hallucination joker to create tarots when a booster opens. But I’d need to sell one joker first.\n**Evaluating joker cards**\n\nI’m considering how crucial the Splash joker is because it lets all played cards score, triggering suits. Without it, I might still score well with pairs, but it would be less effective overall. The Hanging Chad joker is also important for retriggering the first card. The Abstract Joker has a valuable +18 multiplier, while the 8 Ball offers tarot opportunities but has a negative effect. It seems the 8 Ball grants an additional joker slot, increasing my maximum, but selling it would reduce my slots unless I sell another joker too.\n**Choosing card packs wisely**\n\nI’m debating whether to keep the 8 Ball for extra slots or if it’s unnecessary since our base might be at 5. Selling it requires letting go of another joker, so I should avoid that. Instead, I could buy booster packs to enhance my deck. I’m considering the Emperor and Spectral Pack for $7, leaving me some cash. The Spectral Pack could provide immediate benefits, so I’ll prioritize that. I can make my choice step by step, starting with buying the Spectral Pack first for immediate use.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
