{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI'm considering my options in a game scenario involving a blind select and a big blind ante. If I skip the big blind, I could get a boss tag but lose out on $4 and a shop visit. However, it seems like skipping the blind moves me forward in the game without visiting the shop, which could waste my coupon tag. The coupon applies to the next shop visit after I win against the boss, so I need to think this through carefully.\n**Analyzing game decisions**\n\nI'm weighing the choice between playing the big blind or skipping it. If I play the big blind, I lose $4 but gain money and can use my coupon tag for rewards right away. Skipping gives a boss tag which rerolls the boss, but that could lead to a more difficult encounter later since the current boss seems manageable. Plus, I have Ice Cream providing extra chips, making the big blind play look much more beneficial overall. So, I think playing the big blind is the way to go!\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI've realized that the Ancient Joker triggers whenever a played card of the specified suit is scored, providing a x1.5 multiplier during scoring. This is part of category 3. The Ice Cream adds chips independently in category 5, meaning the order of play isn't too critical right now. However, if I decide to rearrange for future jokers, it might matter more. But for now, I think I can just proceed with the action and play the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
