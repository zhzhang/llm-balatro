{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card triggering effects**\n\nOkay, I need to think carefully about the order of triggers for the Ancients and Scholar. If the Scholar goes first, it allows for a multiplier effect, but if it’s after the Ancients, it won’t be multiplied. So, positioning the Scholar leftmost is ideal. I’m considering whether to move Hanging Chad left, as it retriggers the first played card. Its timing is critical during the score phase, but its current position seems fine since it only affects retriggering jokers. Splash might also need to be assessed for its scoring implications.\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to keep Splash last in the action order. Selling a joker might raise some money to buy Earth or Devious, but Splash is super important since it lets all played cards count for scoring—this means I can play off-hand cards effectively and still get value. It’s crucial for synergy with the Ancient and Scholar triggers since I can trigger everything even with just a pair. So, Splash is definitely a keeper. I’m also weighing if Devious could be better than Scholar, but since we don’t focus on straights, it might not be worth it.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nUsing Earth for a full house doesn’t seem relevant right now, so I won't need to save for future moves. I think it’s best to move on to the next round instead. I need to create the appropriate action JSON for executing the round_select action. This seems straightforward, and ensuring everything is properly formatted will help keep the game flowing smoothly. Time to get that set up!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
