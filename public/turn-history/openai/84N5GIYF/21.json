{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nI'm in a shop with $0, and my only option is to proceed with the round selection. I’m considering if rearranging jokers might affect triggers. I think Ice Cream acts as a joker providing +100 chips, reduced by 5 per hand played. Ancient, on the other hand, triggers based on scored cards. The order seems to matter, especially since Ice Cream is an independent joker. I should probably go ahead with the round selection now.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
