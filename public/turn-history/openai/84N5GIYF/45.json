{"reasoning":"**Considering strategy options**\n\nI’m seeing that the tag mentions giving $1 for every played hand, which translates to $6 right now. While that isn’t huge compared to a potential $4 reward, I want to shop before the boss to possibly sell invisible when it reaches 2/2. If I play big, I can sell it for a chance to dupe an Ancient joker. Skipping the big play means losing that chance. Hmm, I need to settle on whether to play the round now.\n**Evaluating joker order**\n\nI'm thinking about the Ancient joker, which gives a x1.5 multiplier when it scores. The Hanging Chad joker retriggers the first played card used in scoring, but I’m unsure about the order affecting this. Since it retriggers left-to-right, having Hanging Chad on the left ensures it triggers before others. I currently have Ancient first, Ice Cream second, and Chad last, but maybe I should reconsider that. Ultimately, I need to decide if I want to reposition Chad earlier in the order.\n**Deciding on play action**\n\nI'm realizing that on scored jokers trigger in order for each card, so having Chad earlier in the order might not be necessary since it's not an on scored joker. I think I'll keep the current arrangement as it is. Now, I just need to proceed with the action to play the round. Time to prepare the JSON that specifies the action for play_round. This should help move the game forward!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
