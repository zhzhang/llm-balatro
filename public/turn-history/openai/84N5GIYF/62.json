{"reasoning":"**Assessing the game mechanics**\n\nI'm facing the blind select boss, needing 4000 chips, and all club cards are debuffed. We can't skip the boss, so I question whether we should play. The order of joker effects is essential here. Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card used in scoring, which I need to confirm. Retriggering is a joker effect in category 3, meaning I need to consider the order and how other jokers impact scoring. I've got two Ancients and one Odd Todd with specific mechanics in play.\n**Analyzing joker strategy**\n\nI want both Ancient and Odd Todd to apply before the retrigger, so they're included in those actions. The retrigger repeats the whole sequence: base chips, modifiers, and on-scored jokers. It seems like the order among jokers doesn't matter within a retrigger, but since retriggering is called separately, maybe I should place Chad on the far left to ensure its effect applies first. If Chad is among the jokers when a card scores, its effect would activate during scoring. The club debuffs mean no chips or abilities from played club cards, but I can still form a hand!\n**Clarifying boss strategy**\n\nWe're facing the boss right after the big blind, in round 5. I know the Ancient Joker's suit changes at the end of the round; currently, I suspect it might be hearts, but I'm not sure. We need a strategy for the boss and should probably avoid clubs since they’re debuffed. Although the debuffs disable chip values and abilities, I have to consider if a played heart triggers the Ancient joker. But if a debuffed card can't trigger due to its abilities being disabled, that complicates things.\n**Understanding debuffs and triggers**\n\nThe debuff does indeed disable the abilities and chip values of the card itself, but Ancient's effect is tied to the joker, not the individual card. Still, I'm wondering if the debuffed status prevents card triggers. According to the rules, while the debuffed card can participate in forming a hand, it won’t score chips and won't trigger \"on scored\" effects, including those linked to its suit. So yes, a debuffed card can't trigger jokers that depend on scoring, which complicates how to strategize!\n**Refining the strategy for the boss**\n\nDebuffs mean a card doesn’t score chips, trigger enhancements, or activate \"on scored\" effects. However, it may still trigger \"on played\" effects, which I need to confirm. Given the rules, a debuffed card participates in forming a hand without scoring. If a suit joker relies on scoring, it won’t trigger with a debuffed card. Clubs are debuffed, so I should avoid them but can use them as filler for forming a hand. Ancient jokers likely suit hearts right now, which is good! I want to maximize my triggers for that heart flush with the right order of cards, keeping Chad on the far right.\n**Strategizing the round play**\n\nI’m thinking about whether to place Odd Todd before Ancient since it adds chips when scored. But the order primarily matters because they both affect scoring. The retriggering joker, Chad, likely works after on-scored jokers, which might not affect the initial scoring sequence. We should just play the round but could rearrange the order for optimal timing. The boss debuffs clubs, making flushes tough, but with a good heart strategy, I could still exceed 4000 chips with scoring combinations. Let’s ensure the first card is a heart to maximize our potential!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
