{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip totals**\n\nIn option B, I calculated the chips, starting with a base of 55 and adding Ace chips, plus bonuses per trigger. I figured out total chips to be 173 after all cards were considered. Multiplying by 193.6 gives about 33,500, which is still lower than option A but adequate. I’ll keep 8C in the first position as planned. So for action, I’m looking at playing cards in positions 1 through 5, estimating around 37,000 chips. I want to format the output in JSON.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
