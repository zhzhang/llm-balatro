{"reasoning":"**Evaluating chip strategies**\n\nOkay, so adding 100 chips could be substantial, especially if the multiplier is around 200. The previous pair gave me 37k chips, and if the multiplier holds, that’s an extra 20k chips. However, forming a straight might limit my ability to capitalize on pairs. The hand’s scoring depends on the type—if I play a straight with five cards, the hand type is just a straight. This could impact my base chips and scoring dynamics. With splash mechanics, every played card seems to contribute to scoring, which is crucial to remember.\n**Clarifying scoring rules**\n\nSo, it looks like the rule about the highest hand is overridden. All selected cards score their chips and any effects, no matter their hand type. This means all five cards will count, even if they're not in the hand. For a straight, all five cards contribute regardless of any splash mechanic. But I wonder if creating a straight is more challenging than making a pair? It seems harder, but I already have a pair at level 5 and scoring is good enough. Consistency seems key here, especially under boss debuffs. With $4, I might buy an Arcana pack to get cards that modify the deck.\n**Assessing deck adjustments**\n\nIt seems like I don’t need to free joker slots, which could help with suit conversion before the boss fight. But do I have enough time? The boss is up next! I might need to tweak the deck to manage that spade debuff, although we could just avoid playing spades altogether. With a hand size of 8 and 4 discards available, it might work. The Arcana could give me useful cards like The Sun to convert to hearts, or even The Magician. That seems beneficial, but we only have $4 to spend. If I spend it all, I’ll be broke, but it could prove helpful in the battle ahead.\n**Evaluating card choices and budgets**\n\nWith the chad retriggers, the first card can trigger thrice, giving me a +12 multiplier. If I factor in the multipliers from ancient cards, that’s great! I also get an extra 60 chips from that. The scholar is looking really significant here. However, Devious gives +100 chips, though that only applies to straights, so I'm leaning toward the Arcana pack instead. I need to consider my $4 budget: I could buy Earth for $3, but rerolling costs $2, which wouldn’t work. It looks like I can only buy Earth and keep $1.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m weighing my options: I could reroll for $2 and then buy Earth for $3, but that totals $5, which I can’t do. Buying Devious means using all my funds but I’d have to sell a joker too, so that feels risky. It seems like the best bet is to go for the Arcana pack. That could give me suit conversions to ensure hearts or helpful enhancements. Plus, since I have a Hone voucher, I’ll have an increased chance for better cards. I’ll choose the Arcana pack and get ready to buy the booster!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
