{"reasoning":"**Weighing options for purchases**\n\nI’m looking at my consumables right now. I could buy the arcana pack if funds allow after celestial, but it’s tricky. Buying mega for $8 leaves me with $6, and Cloud 9 is $7. If I choose Cloud 9, I could still save $7 for arcana. I could sell Ice Cream for Cloud 9, as it gives $4 per round. However, Ice Cream gives +75 chips. It’s good for scoring, but Cloud 9 has potential for compounding. I need to consider survival against the boss requirements too!\n**Analyzing scoring multipliers**\n\nI’m examining how my multipliers work. I have two Ancient cards, each providing a x1.5 boost for heart-suited cards. Plus, Hanging Chad allows me to retrigger my first scored card twice. Then there's Odd Todd giving me +31 chips for odd ranks, which can greatly enhance my plays. If I score with an odd heart, the multipliers could stack up nicely. With each scoring event including the Ancient effect, the multiplier grows rapidly—essentially multiplying by 2.25 with each score due to the retriggering! It’s all quite fascinating!\n**Deciding on upgrades and purchases**\n\nAfter scoring three times, the multiplier is impressive at 11.39! This makes a single heart odd card potentially a strong high card. I’m thinking it might not be necessary to improve hand levels right now, considering how planet upgrades can boost chips. The celestial pack has random planets, but the mega pack allows me to choose two, which is more advantageous. I think I’ll buy the mega celestial and jumbo arcana for $14. Selling Ice Cream for Cloud 9 is an option, but I might prefer holding off for now!\n**Prioritizing scoring and jokers**\n\nI’m realizing that focusing on scoring might be more important than economy right now. With the investment tag, my economy will be solid, making Cloud 9 less vital. So, my next step is to buy the Mega Celestial booster. Once purchased, I’ll see the pack options, but first, I need to consider the order of my jokers: ancient, ice cream, hanging chad, and odd todd. The ancient triggers give multipliers for heart-suited cards, and I need to account for the order, as each scoring can affect the next!\n**Figuring out scoring order**\n\nOdd Todd adds chips, so it seems like the optimal order would have Odd Todd apply before Ancient, but maybe that's not crucial. The multipliers from Ancient and chips from Odd Todd are separate until the final score calculation. Since Odd Todd increases chips, I need to ensure that chips are enhanced before applying the multiplier. However, since they use different accumulators, the order doesn’t affect the final outcome. I still need to consider Hanging Chad, as its retriggering might impact the scoring order. Overall, I’m ready to buy the Mega Celestial now!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
