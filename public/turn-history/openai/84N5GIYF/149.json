{"reasoning":"**Considering strategies for gameplay**\n\nI'm thinking playing small first to accumulate money and then deciding on bigger plays could be a good approach. The juggle tag allows for a bigger hand size next round, but if I play big, I won't have the tag. However, shopping after making a big play could lead to better improvements, although the boss might disable key cards. Having a larger hand could help secure essential cards like spades. The polychrome tag gives extra value, but I need to weigh the risks of skipping small for that advantage.\n**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI need to figure out if I can manage to beat the big play with $0 and my current setup, which seems possible. Skipping the small means losing $3 and a chance to shop. Playing at big blind offers $4 plus shopping opportunities. The next shop has a free Polychrome joker, which is significant since I might not have funds otherwise. However, with my reroll costs potentially reducing to zero, I need to consider these costs carefully, as they were previously listed at $1 even with two vouchers.\n**Analyzing reroll strategy**\n\nI’m pondering whether the reroll cost should actually be $0, especially since I have a glut and surplus, but it’s currently shown as $1. If rerolling costs 0 or 1, I could manage even with low funds. Starting the shop after the big play would give me at least $4, plus whatever leftover hands I have. It’s crucial to prioritize power for the boss. I’m weighing the options between skipping small for the polychrome tag or skipping big for juggling, but those choices come with trade-offs.\n**Evaluating hand size impact**\n\nI'm trying to figure out whether increasing my hand size or going for the polychrome joker is more beneficial. Increasing hand size helps find flushes and spades, which is crucial because my build relies on scoring with spades. Although I only have 6 spades in the deck, I have 4 discards to consider. However, the boss disables a random joker each round, making spades more critical. The polychrome joker could give me a solid multiplier, but I’d need to decide what joker to sell, possibly the 8 Ball or Splash, knowing Splash is vital for scoring.\n**Deciding on optimal plays**\n\nI'm analyzing the scoring mechanics here. The ancient triggers score for played cards with spades, and the splash card allows all played cards to count in scoring, which is crucial for triggering ancients. Without splash, I can only score the highest hand. I see the value in both keeping splash and hanging chad for maximizing potential scores. The 8 Ball plays a unique role too, helping maintain slots for jokers. Given the current situation, I think skipping the small play to aim for a helpful joker seems like a wise choice, despite giving up the $3 reward. So, I’ll proceed with that decision by choosing to skip the small round.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
