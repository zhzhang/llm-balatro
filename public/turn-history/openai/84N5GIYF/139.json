{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about the scoring process, especially for scored jokers and how the Tribe might work with the Ancient cards. It seems like Tribe could apply after all card scores have been calculated, with the process moving left-to-right. For each card, the Ancient powers would trigger, and then we’d handle any independent jokers. However, I’m unsure about using consumables during a blind selection since the target card positions aren’t revealed. I'll need to clarify this before proceeding.\n**Finalizing action for the game**\n\nI’ve realized that I can use the command to consume a card if I specify the target positions, but without current hand information, I can’t proceed with that. Instead, I’ll move on to the boss round and respond with an action JSON for play_round. Estimating chips is tricky, but I believe we need at least 140k, so I'll estimate around 160k based on previous outcomes. For the metadata, I can just provide null. Let’s go ahead and output this!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
