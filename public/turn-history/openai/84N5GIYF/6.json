{"reasoning":"**Weighing joker options**\n\nI’m looking at the choices within the Buffoon Pack: either the Drunkard or Diet Cola jokers. The Drunkard offers consistent value with a +1 discard each round, which is appealing for early game consistency. On the other hand, the Diet Cola provides utility for creating double tags, which could be powerful later. While I like the consistency of the Drunkard, I also see the potential of double tagging, especially if paired with strong tags later. Overall, I lean towards the Drunkard for immediate benefits.\n**Choosing the right joker**\n\nI’m considering that Diet Cola could be strategically better if I want to skip for tags, but skipping might sacrifice shop opportunities, which is a bit concerning. The Drunkard seems like a reliable choice since it consistently adds value. So, I believe going with the Drunkard is the way to go. Now, I need to execute the select command and confirm my choice. I’ll go ahead and select 1 since there are no specific targets required.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
