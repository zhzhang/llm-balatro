{"reasoning":"**Choosing the best planet pack**\n\nI’m looking at options from the meteor tag in the Mega Celestial pack. There are five choices, and it seems I need to pick the best planet to improve my build. My strategy relies on creating pairs, three of a kind, or flushes, and I currently have a Splash ability that scores all cards. The most common plays are Pair and three of a kind, and I think I'll go with Venus to boost my three of a kind for better consistency.\n**Selecting Venus from the shop**\n\nI remember that Venus was available in the shop before, but I couldn't afford it at the time. Now, I’ve decided to select Venus since it's in position 4. I’ll issue the command to select it: “select 4.” This choice aligns with my strategy, and hopefully, this time I can make it work for my build. Fingers crossed that this investment pays off!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
