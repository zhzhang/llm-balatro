{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Joker Configurations**\n\nI'm in a shop with $10 and my current jokers include Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Gift Card, and Glass Joker. It looks like my strategy is centered around triggering face cards with Photograph and Chad to retrigger the first played card. Stuntman offers huge chips but reduces my hand size by 2. Gift Card boosts my multiplier and sell values. I’m reassessing the Glass Joker’s x1 scaling, but its secondary description may be misinterpreted and likely refers to glass cards instead.\n**Evaluating Joker Options**\n\nI might be a bit confused about the Glass Joker's role; it seems to imply it acts like each card, but that feels improbable. For now, I'll treat it as just glass-related information. In the shop, there’s the Zany Joker, which offers a +12 multiplier with three of a kind, and the Ceremonial Dagger, which can destroy a joker to the right and double its value. The Acrobat gives a x3 multiplier for the final hand, while the Lusty Joker adds +3 for each heart scored. I need to decide on purchases carefully since we typically play flush/high card, not three of a kind.\n**Deciding on Joker Replacements**\n\nThe Acrobat provides a x3 multiplier for the final hand, which could be crucial since bosses require multiple hands. I think we should plan to score big on the last hand, even though we often finish blind early. The Acrobat's multiplicative multiplier is appealing. I’m considering which joker to replace, and maybe the Glass Joker, since it's only x1 and isn't scaling yet. The Gift Card is good for the economy but might be less needed now. I'm keeping the Stuntman for the +250 base chips and Photograph + Chad duo since they have strong synergy. So it looks like the weakest option is the Glass Joker.\n**Calculating Card Changes**\n\nIt turns out the Gift Card is a holo edition that adds a +10 multiplier, along with a base effect of adding $1 to the sell value at the end. Since the Acrobat gives a x3 multiplier, I can see it's a stronger choice, but it costs $6. With only $10, I need to sell the Glass Joker first for $3 to free up a slot. After selling, I'll have $13, then I can buy the Acrobat for $6, leaving me with $7. That's okay since I’ll also earn interest based on this amount at the end of the round!\n**Weighing Card Choices**\n\nThe Ceremonial Dagger could become valuable by eating the jokers to the right each time, especially in conjunction with the Gift Card to increase sell values. However, we only have 5 jokers, meaning I'd need sacrificial ones to feed the dagger, which is risky. I could buy it to eat either the Glass Joker or Gift Card, but losing their effects is a downside. \n\nZany and Lusty Jokers offer some growth potential too, but Acrobat’s x3 multiplier seems more valuable. Since I need to maximize my multipliers as antes rise, I should sell the Glass Joker for $3 to create room, then buy the Acrobat for $6. That will leave me with $7 to work with moving forward.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
