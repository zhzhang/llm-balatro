{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nI need to figure out what to do in the shop with $3. I’m looking at two options: buy a Tower for $3 or reroll the shop for something else. However, I can’t buy the Tower since it’s a tarot consumable requiring a target card in hand, and my slots are full. Rerolling is also limited by my remaining funds. Selling a consumable like Justice for $2 could let me buy the Tower later, but I still need to consider my hand situation.\n**Evaluating the Tower card**\n\nI’m considering whether the Tower card is good. It adds +50 chips, but it doesn’t help with a flush since it has no rank or suit. I realize the stone card can still count towards hand size but won’t contribute to hand types. Since it doesn't suit a flush, it could break that formation. The best strategy may involve playing a high card first to trigger bonuses from Chad, Photograph, Smiley, and Gift, maximizing our score despite the low base hand level.\n**Assessing the stone card in high card play**\n\nIn high card play, only one card is used, so having a strong card is key. I'm wondering if the stone card could act as the sole card in a high card scenario. Since it has no rank, I'm not sure if it counts as a high card. While stone cards score +50 chips in Balatro, they might be treated as blanks. I think I'd prefer to focus on strong retrigger cards like Justice for maximizing points instead of relying on the stone card. We’ll use Justice in the next round!\n**Evaluating the Wraith spectral card**\n\nI’m considering the Wraith spectral card, which can create a random Rare Joker but sets my money to zero. However, my joker slot is full, so I may need to sell something like Smiley or Pareidolia. Smiley and Photograph work well together, giving multipliers when face cards are played, while Pareidolia supports this synergy. Even though Wraith might produce a useful Rare Joker, with only $3, I should be cautious. I can free a joker slot by selling Smiley or Pareidolia before using Wraith.\n**Deciding on using Wraith and shop strategy**\n\nI’m weighing the option of using Wraith, which would consume it, create a rare joker, and set my money to zero. That could be risky since I might lose Smiley. It feels like I should keep Pareidolia for consistency in triggering with Smiley and Photograph. I could sell something to free a slot for a joker, but I'm also considering selling Wraith for immediate cash. Selling gives me flexibility, but using Wraith now seems fine too if I’m low on options. I might just reroll to see new items or save up for a potential purchase later.\n**Weighing Wraith and joker options**\n\nI’m considering using Wraith, which could give me a rare joker, valuable for future antes. I might need to sacrifice Smiley or Gift; Gift is more beneficial overall. If I use Wraith now, I lose $3 but gain a joker. Selling Smiley first could free a slot, but my money would still drop to zero. Alternatively, if I sell Justice to fund a purchase, I still can’t buy anything useful. I think I should sell Smiley to prepare for using Wraith next, optimizing my multipliers in the process.\n**Deciding on joker and actions**\n\nI have to decide whether to sell Smiley first. If I do, I'll have $5. I could reroll for $3, keeping $2, or use Wraith next, which sets money to zero. If I reroll now, I might see a good planet, but I wouldn't be able to buy it if my cash is zero. Instead, I might consider selling Wraith for $4; if I do that, I can reroll and still keep my jokers. But holding onto Wraith could pay off later. I think Smiley is the best choice to replace, as Gift Card offers significant benefits.\n**Choosing optimal action**\n\nI’m reconsidering whether sacrificing Smiley is the right move, as it could help with scaling. I might instead sell a different joker, so I'll choose to sell Smiley to free up a slot for Wraith, which I plan to use next. Rearranging the jokers could also be beneficial, maybe moving Gift earlier in the order. \n\nI’ve settled on selling Smiley as my next action, followed by using Wraith. It feels like the best immediate option.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
