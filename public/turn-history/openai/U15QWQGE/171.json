{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nI’m considering the mechanics involving \"+2 Chips for each remaining card in the deck,\" which seems to add chips during the independent stage. The order might not matter for independent actions, except in cases of a multiplier after, but I believe the Blue Joker is the only independent one here. Rearranging the order might be something like: Photograph, Bloodstone, Hanging Chad, Pareidolia, and Blue Joker. But, I’m not entirely sure if Pareidolia should be ahead regarding scoring.\n**Clarifying card order**\n\nTo keep things simple, I need to ensure that the Photograph is positioned to the left of Hanging Chad to allow for retriggers. The current order is Photograph, Hanging Chad, Pareidolia, Bloodstone, and then Blue Joker. Since Hanging Chad is left of Bloodstone, it should trigger before it. If Chad triggers retriggers, it might affect the sequence. When it retriggers, it could include Bloodstone since it's played before that, but I want to maximize our chances. So Bloodstone should ideally be in the retrigger sequence as the first card.\n**Exploring retrigger implications**\n\nI’m wondering if Chad's retrigger only applies the card without affecting the jokers to the right. Actually, the retrigger seems to replicate the entire scoring of the card, incorporating all on-scored jokers. So Bloodstone will count, even if it’s to the right. But, if the order impacts which jokers are included, that might be a concern. It's wise to put Bloodstone before Chad to be safe, maybe even before Photograph. Also, I need to consider how multipliers combine—like if Photograph doubles and Bloodstone applies a 1.5x multiplier, the commutative property means the order probably won't matter unless there's other enhancements.\n**Considering multipliers and game mechanics**\n\nI realize that multipliers are simply numbers, and when using x multipliers, the order doesn't really matter. However, if there's an addition from a Lucky card that gives a +20 multiplier, it’s crucial to see where that fits. The card modifiers are applied before the jokers, meaning the Lucky card enhancement impacts things. Since Photograph and Bloodstone are both x multipliers, they don't affect each other’s order. With the boss reducing hand size by one, it could make building a flush a bit tougher. Still, getting the needed 40,000 chips with a strong flush should be doable. I’m wondering if we should use the Magician beforehand, but I need to consider hand targets first.\n**Deciding joker arrangement**\n\nIt seems like I’ll decide whether to make lucky hearts during the round. For now, I’m thinking of rearranging the jokers. I propose to place Pareidolia first, even though it’s passive, just to ensure clarity. So the order would ideally be: Pareidolia, Photograph, Bloodstone, Hanging Chad, and Blue Joker. I wonder if Photograph needs to be left of the others since on-scored triggers go from left to right. But, rearranging jokers doesn’t incur any cost, so I’ll go ahead with it during this blind select phase to optimize for the next turn. The action I’ll take now is to rearrange the jokers. Let's do it!\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [3,1,4,2,5]"}
