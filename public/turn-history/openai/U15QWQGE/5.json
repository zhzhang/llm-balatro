The multiplier gives me 104, but I actually need 600 total. Averaging about 150 per hand over four hands isn't cutting it. I should aim for better hands like straights or full houses. If I can make a full house with certain cards, I might hit the target. Let's see what's possible!\\n**Analyzing card combinations**\\n\\nI've counted the cards and realized there's only one 9 left in the deck. I currently have two 9s in my hand, and one of those 9s is a heart, which means it's debuffed. I could still use that to make three of a kind with the 9s, giving me decent chip totals. If I manage to create a full house from the 9s and 7s, I could get a solid total. This strategy might just work!\\n**Confirming the full house**\\n\\nI just realized I do have three 9s: the 9 of hearts, the 9 of clubs, and the 9 of diamonds. Plus, I have two 7s, which means I can make a full house with 9s over 7s! The scoring looks good too: a base of 40 chips times a multiplier of 4 gives me 288 chips, almost half of my target of 600. After this hand, I\\u2019ll draw five new cards but keep my Ace of hearts and 3 of hearts in hand, along with the 5 of clubs. This strategy seems solid!\\n**Planning the next play**\\n\\nI\\u2019ve got the 5 of clubs remaining in my hand, along with the Ace of hearts and the 3 of hearts. After I play my five cards for the full house, I\\u2019ll need to draw five new ones to bring my hand back to eight, just like in the Balatro game. I think my estimated total chips for this play should be 288. I\\u2019ll structure the action in JSON format to play the cards in those positions, knowing that order isn\\u2019t essential for scoring. This strategy looks solid!\\n\\nCommand: play 2 4 5 7 8 full house 288\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 5]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Foil Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil\\n2: Holographic Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Boss.\\nBoss Description: All Heart cards are debuffed.\\nChips Needed: 600\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 10 of Spades.

I have three remaining hands and can discard four cards. My current hand has a mix of debuffed cards, but I can form a full house with the three 5s (5\\u2663, 5\\u2666, 5\\u2665) and a pair of 3s (3\\u2660, 3\\u2665). Unfortunately, the debuffed hearts won't contribute chips. My scoring will depend on the base and multipliers from the formation.\\n**Evaluating chip strategies**\\n\\nI calculated that my total chips would be 53 base with multipliers, bringing me to just 500, leaving me needing 100 chips with two hands left. I initially thought of playing three of a kind with irrelevant kickers, but it seems only my hand cards count. If I go with the two pair formation of 5s and 3s, that would score lower. I\\u2019m leaning toward sticking with the full house strategy, but I wonder if I should try discarding for a straight or flush.\\n**Exploring hand options**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering aiming for a straight with my current cards: A, 3, 5, 10, and Q, but it doesn\\u2019t look promising. I have four discards left, and I\\u2019m thinking about discarding hearts to improve my hand for a better full house or four of a kind. However, I already have a full house secured, so it might be wiser to play it. After that, I\\u2019ll want to work on getting 100 chips in two hands, perhaps by aiming for a pair with high cards, like Kings.\\n**Deciding on hand strategy**\\n\\nI\\u2019m looking at the option of forming a pair of 10s, which would give me a total of 60 chips with multipliers. However, I\\u2019m considering going for a bigger payout by trying for a straight or flush instead. After playing my full house, I can draw five new cards and keep three from my hand. I\\u2019ll decide between leaving cards like 10\\u2660 and Q\\u2663 or considering A\\u2665 for a possible straight, even though it\\u2019s debuffed. I want to ensure I don\\u2019t lose out on the potential full house.\\n**Finalizing card play**\\n\\nI\\u2019m determining how to play my full house effectively using the positions in my current hand. I\\u2019ll choose cards 2 (3\\u2660), 4 (5\\u2665), 5 (3\\u2665), 7 (5\\u2663), and 8 (5\\u2666) to form a full house with fives over threes. I estimate my total chips to be 212 from this play. The base for a full house is 40 chips with a multiplier of 4, plus additional chips from participating cards. After this round, my total will reach 500 chips.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nplay <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Play the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may play up to 5 cards at a time. If you play a hand, you must also respond with the intended hand type you think you are playing, and an estimate of the number of chips you think you will earn from the hand. Use the results of previous hands played to inform your estimate.\\ndiscard <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Discard the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may discard up to 5 cards at a time.\\nrearrange_hand <card1> <card2> ... <cardN> - Rearrange the hand of cards.

  "reasoning": "**Analyzing card play**\n\nI'm in a situation where I need 600 chips, but I currently have 500 and only two hands left with four discards. I've got some solid cards, and I'm thinking about whether I can play a straight. I've got a sequence that includes a debuffed Q, but it still can contribute. I realize that overall, I could potentially earn enough chips with my straight to surpass the 600-chip mark easily.\n**Validating my card play**\n\nI need to confirm if I can count my straight using the A, but since I'm using 9, 10, J, Q, and K, it's valid—even with hearts debuffed. A flush isn't possible since I have only four spades, so I’ll go with the straight. I’ll need the indices I have: 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. The calculation for chips shows a base of 30 plus contributions from my cards, totaling 59 chips, multiplied gives me 236. That definitely covers my needs!\n**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI'm getting ready to return a JSON object that includes the action to play a straight. I’ll specify the estimated chips as 236 and include the positions of the cards involved, which are [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]. This structured approach should clearly convey my intended move and the necessary details. It's all about being precise and ensuring that everything is correctly formatted for easy reference! Let's get that set up!\n"
