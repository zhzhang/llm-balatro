{"reasoning":"**Calculating lucky strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about how luck factors into my high card strategy. If I can get the Ace of spades as my first card, it could trigger multiple times, potentially leading to a +20 multiplier. I believe there's a 1 in 5 chance to trigger it, plus 1 in 15 to win $20. If I can retrigger, each one adds another chance. So, I need to keep the Ace as my first scoring card while maximizing synergies with other cards!\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI'm realizing that with the Lucky chance at 20% for each scoring card, having three triggers gives me a 48.8% chance to score at least once. The +20 multiplier can really stack up with the existing multipliers. I think I should focus on using the Magician for the Ace of spades and possibly the Queen of clubs or hearts as alternatives if the Ace is missing. The clubs could create a flush, so I’ll choose the Queen of clubs to strengthen that option!\n**Choosing card positions**\n\nI’m considering using the Queen of hearts to help with a heart flush since I already have a few hearts in hand. But the Queen of clubs seems like a better choice since it fits well into my club-suit strategy without disrupting my plan for spades. I need to select my card positions now. For the Magician, I’ll set the pack position to 3, using the Ace of spades as position 1 and the Queen of clubs as position 5. So, I’ll go with `select 3 1 5`.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,1,5]"}
