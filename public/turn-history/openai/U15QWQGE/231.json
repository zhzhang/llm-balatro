{"reasoning":"**Analyzing tarot options**\n\nI'm thinking about how the targeted tarot can't be used if I buy it directly in the shop. The requirement is to have cards in hand during a round, which makes it tricky. I can use consumables during a round, but I can't do that with the shop's cards. So, buying The Lovers could work if I use it in a round later, but my slots are full. I might need to sell the Magician or Chariot for space, but I'm not sure if that's the best move since they have valuable benefits.\n**Exploring trigger strategies**\n\nI'm considering the retrigger mechanics and how lucky triggers might activate multiple times, which is great! The Lucky card has a specific chance for a +20 multiplier when scored, and with each scoring instance (including retriggers), it increases the odds. This could lead to massive multipliers! With my scoring cards boosted by some good cards, like sock and chad, I can maximize this. The Chariot has benefits, particularly with the steel card affecting my hand size. Making a heart card steel could be strategically significant. Overall, I might not need to replace consumables, as they’re already strong.\n**Reviewing joker order**\n\nI’m thinking about whether to keep my current order of cards or rearrange the jokers for scoring effects. Pareidolia is passive and independent, while Photograph is an on-scored card that gives a multiplier. This makes the order between Photograph and Ancient significant for scoring. Since Hanging Chad and Sock are retriggerers, their order might affect how retriggers are applied. During the scoring stage, jokers trigger from left to right, so I need to consider how this impacts retriggering as well.\n**Understanding retrigger dynamics**\n\nI'm examining how scoring works with cards and retriggering. After a card scores, it triggers once more. Hanging Chad lets us retrigger the first played card two additional times. The order of retriggering jokers could affect which retriggers activate first. While I think retriggers might be queued separately, some can influence others. In Balatro, jokers don’t retrigger each other, yet multiple retriggers can stack additively. I’m considering whether putting Photograph before Ancient could be useful, but ultimately, on-scored jokers trigger before retriggers, so arranging that thoughtfully is key.\n**Deciding on rerolls and strategy**\n\nI’m weighing the risks and benefits of rerolling my shop options. Hanging Chad and the potential of Blueprint are on my mind—especially how they could multiply retrigger opportunities. If I sell Pareidolia, I could lose the face card status, which is essential. Rerolls are costly at $10 each, but given I have $22, maybe I can afford one to find something game-winning. Alternatively, I might sell Pareidolia for a Fortune Teller, but I’d still depend on other cards for their abilities. I think I’ll start with one reroll and readjust based on what I find!\n**Planning for the final boss**\n\nI’m thinking about how to prepare for the final boss without knowing their specific requirements. We might be able to achieve a heart flush, but drawing enough hearts could be tough with only 8 cards. Considering past notes on a boss, like The Needle, I realize I need to focus on increasing my flush strength; the ante 8 boss likely has a high threshold. Since my current maximum flush isn’t enough, I’m inclined to reroll for The Sun to convert cards to hearts, which would really boost our chances. I might sell Magician or Chariot to make room, prioritizing reliability over luck. So yes, rerolling seems like the best move!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
