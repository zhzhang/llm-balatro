{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchases at ante3**\n\nI’m at shop ante3 with $38 and need to decide on purchases. The options include the Superposition joker for $4, Jupiter flush planet for $3, Celestial pack for $4, Standard pack for $4, and a $10 Overstock voucher. I already have 5 jokers, so buying Superposition means selling one. Superposition could add tarot generation, which might be beneficial for scaling the deck. However, I should also consider the strengths of my current jokers before deciding.\n**Weighing joker options**\n\nSo, Lusty gives a +3 multiplier for hearts scored, which is pretty helpful. The Photograph provides a double multiplier on the first face card scored, and that's also a strong option. I’m weighing which joker to replace with Superposition, but it feels mid-tier. We'd really need to play a straight with an Ace, which adds complexity. Unless I can sell something of low value to make room, I think I’ll skip buying Superposition for now.\n**Considering joker options and purchases**\n\nI'm debating the Trading Card, which gives a consistent $3 per round and thins the deck a bit, so I think it’s a good option. The Mail-in Rebate offers significant chips, while Lusty and Photograph focus on scoring, so I probably don’t want to replace any of them.\n\nThe Overstock voucher is appealing for long-term benefits, and I should buy it. I could also check the Celestial pack for potential upgrades. Standard packs might add useful enhancements but aren’t essential right now. I need to remember my deck's focus on hearts, with 17 remaining!\n**Analyzing flush strategy and potential purchases**\n\nIt looks like the deck's skewed with 16 hearts, but a flush could be strong, especially with Lusty giving multipliers for heart scores. A flush requires five hearts, which is doable. The Photograph also triggers on the first face card, enhancing our strategy, especially if we can score hearts efficiently.\n\nWith the base multiplier at 6, plus Gift Card and Lusty’s bonuses, a hearts flush could really ramp up points. The Jupiter card seems to level up flushes while adding chips too. I should consider whether to buy it in the shop since it could strengthen my strategy!\n**Planning actions in the shop**\n\nI'm considering the commands available to buy cards. Jupiter is a consumable card, and I should use the `buy_and_use_consumable` command since it's in the cards section, but I can also buy cards individually.\n\nSince we can only have two consumables and none right now, buying Jupiter makes sense. First, I think I should buy the Overstock voucher to increase shop slots and possibly open new card options. After that, I’ll buy Jupiter to level up the flush. The order of jokers also matters for scoring, so I’ll keep Lusty before Photograph to maximize multipliers. My first action will be to buy the Overstock voucher!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
