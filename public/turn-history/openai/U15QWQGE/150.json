{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm considering our usual strategy of playing a single high card as the first scored card to retrigger. If that card is a heart, Bloodstone could offer x1.5, potentially multiple times with retriggers—each time it scores. This could be significant but may also be unpredictable. I'm also pondering a consistent joker, like 8 Ball, which generates for 8s, or Wily Joker, which gives +100 chips for three of a kind. Should we restructure our approach to favor playing high cards repeatedly?\n**Analyzing card combinations**\n\nI'm looking at using Acrobat x3 and Card Sharp x3 if we’ve already played a hand this round. Card Sharp seems effective for repeating high cards. I recall a previous high card score of 11,840 without triggering Card Sharp. Hmm, that was the first hand, so Card Sharp didn't activate, but the second could have scored 6,720. I think Card Sharp is stronger and more consistent than Bloodstone, which could stack with other multipliers. Should we swap Acrobat for something else?\n**Evaluating multiplier factors**\n\nI'm calculating expected multiplier factors. Each scoring has a 50% chance to multiply by 1.5, leading to an expected increase of 1.25. After three triggers, that results in about 1.95. If Photograph triggers, it gives a x2 multiplier when the first face card is scored, potentially each time it's scored. With Chad retriggers, it might score three times, leading to x2^3, which is quite a boost! Adding Bloodstone could provide additional multiplicative triggers. If we buy it for $7, I might need to sell a joker, but we should be fine financially.\n**Considering card strategies**\n\nShould we stick to our usual plan? Most bosses require consistency, but we could manage with high card plus Photograph x8 and Card Sharp x3, totaling x24. Those are multipliers, though the base multiplier for high card is just 1. We need more sources of multipliers. I've seen decent scores before—like 11,840 for a single Jack foil and 6,720 for a King. Adding Bloodstone might help us surpass 20k in one hand. \n\nWe should also think about getting a Jumbo Arcana pack for upgrades, along with The Lovers wild that helps with a flush or straight. Plus, we’ve got The Star for converting cards to Diamonds!\n**Evaluating card options and strategies**\n\nI'm considering converting some high multiplier cards to diamonds to create a flush, but we’ve often favored high cards for joker synergy. Flush has base chips of 80 with a multiplier of 10, which might be good if we can rely on it. Photograph and Chad will only work if the first card scored is part of the hand. \n\nBloodstone seems beneficial because hearts are common and could provide extra multipliers. We have a decent chance with hearts at about 36.6%, but we also need to weigh the benefits of keeping Acrobat, which provides a consistent x3 for the final hand. It might be wise to opt for Bloodstone for its ability to trigger consistently across hands, especially since retriggers can stack with Card Sharp. \n\nBuying The Star could help convert cards for a diamond flush, and we should weigh our options. Should I purchase Bloodstone and The Star while considering selling Acrobat? I think Bloodstone offers more flexibility and better potential overall. Lastly, I’m thinking about grabbing a Jumbo Arcana pack for possible enhancements. We have the budget, so why not?\n**Planning card transactions**\n\nSince we have a high-level flush of 4, aiming for flush seems wise, so I should buy Bloodstone. However, first, I need to make space by selling a joker. I can sell Acrobat for $3, then buy Bloodstone for $7, and optionally purchase The Star for another $3. Starting with $22, selling Acrobat brings me to $25. After purchases, I’ll be at $15—still good! \n\nHowever, I can only take one action per turn, so I need to decide to sell Acrobat first before buying Bloodstone. Let's go ahead and sell it!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
