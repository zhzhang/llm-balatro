{"reasoning":"**Analyzing joke mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about how the number of active jokers decreases by one each time, and the total effects really depend on the situation. If a joker has low value, using it as a \"sacrificial\" piece could be beneficial to protect more valuable ones. I’ve got several jokers with different abilities: Pareidolia boosts others, Photograph doubles the first card's effect, and Seltzer retriggers cards. Pareidolia seems vital because it turns non-face cards into face cards, while others might be more redundant. I’m weighing their importance carefully!\n**Rearranging joker strategy**\n\nI'm considering how Sock retriggers all played face cards while Pareidolia allows this for all cards. Ancient provides a significant x1.5 multiplier for hearts, which makes all these jokers important. However, Sock might have low incremental value since Seltzer also retriggers cards. Still, having both can be a good safety net if one gets disabled. I think I should keep all five jokers as “bait.” Before I play a round, I could rearrange them to place Photograph before Ancient to maximize their effects! That sounds like a solid plan.\n**Evaluating jokers' triggers**\n\nI'm thinking about how both Photograph and other jokers affect scores through multiplicative effects. Photograph specifically triggers on the first played face card and can stack with retriggers. If that card retriggers, it will trigger again each time it scores, which can be quite powerful! I need to ensure the first card is a big heart. Maybe I should arrange the jokers to put Photograph first, as the order influences the scoring. Seltzer is a joker too, but it has limited duration, so that adds another layer to consider!\n**Planning the next move**\n\nI’m considering that the boss could disable a joker during a hand, which would prevent retriggers from applying for that hand. It's unclear if the counters would still continue, but I should just play for now. I also have consumables like Magician and Chariot, but I can't use them in BLIND_SELECT since they require target cards in hand, and I don’t have any. So, I’ll proceed and focus on generating the output in JSON format with the action to play a round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
