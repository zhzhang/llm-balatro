{"reasoning":"**Understanding Boss Rules**\n\nI'm looking at the Boss blind rule: \"Play only 1 hand type this round.\" That means we can only play one type of hand after the first one's been played. If we switch to a different type, we won't score. My goal is to choose a hand type that can clear 70,000 points in the remaining four hands. Since our build is flush-based, I need to strategize using the multipliers offered by my cards wisely.\n**Planning Our Flush Strategy**\n\nI see we have some strong hearts: two K♥ and two J♥, plus wild cards like Q♣ and 10♣. To create a flush, we need five cards of the same suit, but we only have four actual hearts. Luckily, wilds can count as hearts, and we have two! So, I’m set on playing a flush as our hand type. I also need to think about the order in which we play the cards, focusing on triggering effects like Photograph and Hanging Chad to maximize our scoring potential. It’s essential to score a heart first for extra bonuses from Bloodstone!\n**Maximizing Scoring Potential**\n\nI’m figuring out how retriggers work; they can repeat the scoring for the card, including activating Bloodstone. To make the most of this, I need to ensure the first card played is a heart, which lets us benefit from both Photograph's x2 multiplier and Bloodstone’s x1.5 for hearts scored. If I start with a Lucky J♥, it could provide a +20 multiplier and increase the chances of retriggers. Since the photograph multiplies each score, if it's the first card, I could end up with a total of x8—nice!\n**Optimizing Card Selection**\n\nI'm focusing on making the first card play really count, prioritizing multipliers over chips. The Lucky J♥ can give a +20 multiplier sometimes, but the K♥ offers a +4 enhancement. If retriggered, that +4 will stack multiple times. Adding on top of the base flush multiplier of 10, Smiley also boosts with +5 for each played face card during scoring. This means if I retrigger the first card, I'll gain +15 from Smiley alone. So, a K♥ could yield a total increase of +12 from multipliers, which is pretty substantial!\n**Choosing the Optimal Card Strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about using the Lucky J, which has a chance to provide a +20 multiplier, but its expected value is around +12. In contrast, the K♥ offers a guaranteed +4 enhancement on each scoring, which could stack significantly. Since Bloodstone triggers on hearts, I could maximize scoring chances here. The key is to ensure that I pick a card that provides a high deterministic multiplier before I trigger others, like Photograph and Smiley. \n\nSo to hit that flush threshold of 70K effectively, I should play a strong flush hand confidently, knowing that my previous big scores indicate success. Aiming for a high multiplier early will also help boost my scores later!\n**Calculating Flush Strategy**\n\nI'm preparing to play a flush and need to ensure I maximize my chances of winning immediately. I estimate chips with a base of 80 for a level 4 flush and add contributions from the cards. I’m looking at the K♥ and two lucky J♥, plus a wild card, giving me a total of 130 chips before modifiers. \n\nEach scoring event can trigger a series of multipliers, including Smiley’s +5 which can add up significantly. Although Lucky J can provide an uncertain boost, my best bet seems to be stacking consistent multipliers through strong card selection. I must also keep in mind that Bloodstone triggers will massively affect my scoring potential if used correctly. \n\nTo clear 70K points, I need at least one Bloodstone trigger from hearts. Given the probability of multiple flushes, I feel fairly confident that with careful planning, I can maximize my score effectively. However, I must be cautious that I maintain enough hearts to keep building my flush!\n**Rearranging Cards for Flush Play**\n\nI'm deciding which card to play first, particularly focusing on the mult-enhanced K♥. To optimize my flush, I've realized I can rearrange my hand to ensure K♥ is the first card played, maximizing its effect. I need to keep in mind how the game's mechanics dictate the order of scoring, as the left-to-right rule influences the multipliers.\n\nI can set up my hand such that K♥ comes first, followed by my lucky J♥ cards. My strategy will involve rearranging so that my chosen cards lead to maximizing additive bonuses before any Bloodstone triggers come into play. While balancing the need for a flush, this is crucial for reaching that 70K score threshold. So yes, I’ll rearrange the hand now!\n**Deciding Card Selection for the Flush**\n\nI need to choose my five cards wisely for the flush, aiming for the highest chip values and maximizing Bloodstone triggers. My target cards are mult K♥, plain K♥, two J♥, and one wild card (likely Q♣). However, I should balance the need for hearts against increasing Bloodstone events. \n\nMaintaining flexibility for future hands is important, since after I play these cards, I draw new ones. If I can optimize how I arrange my hand, I can ensure the right cards come first and maximize my total score!\n**Calculating Flush Scoring Potential**\n\nI'm planning for the scoring event, and I need to figure out the best order for playing my cards. Starting with mult K♥ seems solid, but I might lean towards including Lucky J♥ first for its +20 potential. I realize I need to account for how Bloodstone triggers can amplify scores across multiple events.\n\nCalculating various scenarios gives me a range: without Bloodstone, I might only score around 29k. However, with successful Bloodstone triggers, I could reach much higher. I estimate about a 77% chance to secure at least three Bloodstone procs, which would really boost my score. I need to ensure I'm maximizing all my adds before the multipliers kick in!\n**Planning Flush Strategy**\n\nTo maximize my chances of scoring 70k, I should consider a heart flush and potentially reach around 100k by using strong combinations. It’s crucial to play my cards wisely and make sure I can build another flush if needed.\n\nI'm thinking of starting with Lucky J♥, which gives me additional scoring opportunities with its chance to add +20. This way, I can leverage the multiplier for maximum benefit. I also need to account for Bloodstone triggers that could further boost my score. Rearranging my cards for optimal plays will be key!\n**Optimizing Scoring Events**\n\nI’m analyzing how to maximize my score during scoring events. For the first card, I need to decide between using a Lucky J♥ or a mult K♥. The Lucky J provides a chance for a big multiplier with +20 but is unpredictable, while the mult K offers reliable points at +4.\n\nBy weighing the bloodstone triggers and probabilities of each event, it seems that starting with mult K might give a stronger baseline for reaching at least 70k. I’ll plan to rearrange my hand accordingly for an optimal setup!\n**Planning Flush Strategy**\n\nI’m deciding to play a flush with 4 hearts and 1 wild card, keeping another wild for a potential second flush. I can keep the 10♣ wild unplayed to aid in the next hand. I’ll play positions [1-5] and keep the remaining cards, including the wild and offsuit cards.\n\nAfter playing, I’ll draw 5 new cards. I want to rearrange my hand to maximize my score, moving the cards around before I play. This way, I’ll ensure a great chance for that flush!\n","action":"\"rearrange_hand\"\nPositions: [3,2,4,5,6,7,8,1]"}
