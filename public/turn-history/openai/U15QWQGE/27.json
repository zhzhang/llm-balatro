{"reasoning":"**Considering card effects**\n\nThe UI shows cards from the deck that can be targeted with tarots, which are randomly chosen. The Sigil would change the suit of these displayed cards permanently, which could be helpful for consolidating suits and improving flush chances, especially with hearts. But, I wonder if it might interfere with straight potentials since suit doesn't affect those. Overall, increasing flush chances by making those cards the same suit seems more beneficial, so I’d choose Sigil over Hex, which could be problematic.\n**Choosing the right card**\n\nI’m considering whether to skip the booster. The spectral pack cost has already been paid, so it might be better to go with Sigil since there aren't other strong options. I could look at Hex if I wanted to build around one powerful joker, but doing that early could really mess things up, losing valuable options. So, I'll go ahead and select card 2 (Sigil) without target arguments. Now, I just need to prepare the action JSON.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
