{"reasoning":"**Calculating scoring multipliers**\n\nOkay, so I’m working out how Sock retriggers all played face cards, and these retriggers don’t add to Chad. I realize they apply after scoring and jokers too, and if there are multiple sources, they stack. \n\nFor the first card, I get a total of 4 scoring repetitions, while for the others, it's 2 times each. Smiley gives a +5 multiplier for each scored face card, so that's significant. I think I end up with a total multiplier of 70 before applying Photograph’s effect, which doubles it at the time of scoring.\n**Understanding scoring order**\n\nI’m figuring out the sequence for scoring with Smiley and Photograph. When the first card scores, I add Smiley’s +5, then apply Photograph’s x2 multiplier. I realize both effects happen when the card is scored. For each face card scoring, Smiley contributes a +5 multiplier, and Photograph doubles the total. \n\nTo maximize scores, it makes sense to arrange them so I apply Photograph later, after accumulating all bonuses. This way, Smiley’s +5 gets doubled effectively within the same scoring event. However, if I switch the order, the +5 gets added after the x2, which isn't as beneficial.\n**Planning scoring order with multipliers**\n\nI think Smiley should come before Photograph in the joker order. Other cards might also add their +5 contributions, which can be doubled by future Photograph triggers if they occur later. Since the multiplier is global, those additions accumulate. \n\nI’m wondering if it’s possible to reorder the played cards since they usually score from left to right. It seems we might be able to adjust the play order by selecting them. For now, I’ll focus on buying Sock and Buskin since we have enough funds!\n**Considering card strategy with The Chariot**\n\nI think using The Chariot tarot card to make a steel card could be really beneficial since it gives a x1.5 multiplier when held. The trick is to hold it unplayed, but our strategy is to play a flush with five cards. \n\nIf we select up to five cards to play, any unselected ones stay in hand, allowing the steel card to activate. Keeping a steel card might provide a significant advantage, especially during the boss round, so it’s worth trying to set it aside for each hand.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [3]"}
