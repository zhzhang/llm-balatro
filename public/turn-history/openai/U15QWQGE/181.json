{"reasoning":"**Considering boss game rules**\n\nSo, the boss has a restriction where I can only play one type of hand throughout the round. If I switch, I might get debuffed. It seems like I need to focus on forming a flush consistently. I do have a wild card from the Lovers on the Queen of Spades, and using the Magician could help create lucky cards. I wonder if I can apply it to hearts to boost bloodstone triggers. Interesting to think about how this might work!\n**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m considering skipping small and big yields, which gives me two spectral packs but leaves me with only $2 before the boss, meaning no shop visit. However, after defeating the boss, I’d have $2 plus a $5 reward and leftover hands. There’s also value in playing small and big for $3 and $4, which could give access to shops. After each round, buying options appear, so I should likely play small to build money and still gain access to the shop later.\n**Considering strategy options**\n\nIf I skip the big play, I avoid the large chip requirement of 52,500, but I think I can beat it anyway. Skipping big does provide a tag, but at the cost of a $4 reward and access to the shop. Since I need to prepare for the boss constraint, it might make sense to stick with my flush strategy and increase my hand level with planets like Jupiter. Playing small gives me access to the shop afterward, which is essential, but skipping small means I could miss out on $3. Playing gives me a chance to gain gold and interest, so I’d prefer that! Getting a free Spectral Pack could be incredibly valuable.\n**Weighing options for growth**\n\nI’m considering skipping the small play to gain a free spectral pack while still playing big and facing the boss. This strategy means I’ll miss one shop visit, but the spectral pack will appear in the next shop. If I skip the small round, the next shop will be after the big blind or after the boss. The boss’s ante is manageable with one good flush, which I think I can achieve. Maximizing resources for ante 8 is key, so skipping small might be beneficial, especially since I have $2 and no pressing purchases. A free spectral pack could really boost my game!\n**Deciding on gameplay strategy**\n\nI need to beat the big play and the boss while considering the benefits of the shop afterward. If I play big, I can earn $4 and potentially gain leftover hand money. It seems smart to skip small, then play big for a shop visit and a free spectral pack afterward. Skipping small won't let me use the Magician, but that's okay because I still get a spectral pack before the boss. Therefore, I think the best approach is to skip small and play big. This strategy could be helpful against the boss!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
