{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop strategy**\n\nI need to figure out my next shop action. I have $6 and a Lovers consumable. The shop offers options like Devious Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Crazy Joker. I can't afford the $10 Telescope voucher, and rerolls are $3. My goal is to win the run, and since my core combo with flush hearts produces a lot of chips, I might not need new jokers. I think conserving my money for the Telescope later is wise. However, buying an Arcana pack for $4 could help create more hearts. But then again, I already have Lovers to turn a card into Wild for Bloodstone, which counts as any suit.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI realized that wild cards count as Hearts, meaning Lovers can create extra hearts for a flush, but with 13 hearts in the deck, it might not be necessary. I should think about saving my money for rerolls or a voucher. Selling Lovers for $1 doesn't seem like a good idea. The Mail-in Rebate could generate money by discarding Queens, but since all face cards matter less right now, it’s a bit tricky. Replacing Bloodstone with this rebate could weaken my strategy since Bloodstone provides a big multiplier for hearts.\n**Understanding card mechanics**\n\nBloodstone triggers on any heart card scoring, including retriggers. That's quite significant! Smiley gives a massive +25 multiplier, and with a retrigger on the first card, it could add an extra +10. I realized that Smiley only triggers when a face card scores, and since pareidolia acts on all face cards, it adds to the scoring events. The additive multipliers increase during scoring, so I can't afford to drop any jokers. Instead, it's best to move to the next round and consider rearranging the joker order to maximize effectiveness.\n**Optimizing joker order**\n\nSmiley Face provides a +5 multiplier when played face cards are scored, while Photograph gives a 2x multiplier for the first played face card. Bloodstone also triggers when scored. Hanging Chad acts as a retrigger joker, allowing the first played card to be used two additional times. My goal is to optimize the order of jokers for scoring benefits. I think the best sequence might be Smiley first, then Photograph, followed by Bloodstone, to maximize the bonuses from each card effectively.\n**Finalizing joker order and next actions**\n\nI see that Photograph only triggers on the first played face card during scoring, while Bloodstone activates for hearts. My optimal order for jokers should be Smiley Face, Photograph, and Bloodstone. Hanging Chad, as a retrigger joker, operates in a different step. Since I'm considering the influence of Pareidolia, it should still be positioned first; thus the order looks good as Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, Bloodstone, and Hanging Chad. Now, I’m deciding whether to buy an Arcana pack to boost my scoring for the boss, but that could hinder saving for the Telescope. I'm leaning towards skipping the purchase and just proceeding.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
