{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategies**\n\nSpectral offers some crazy mechanics, like the \"Sigil\" which converts all cards in hand to the same suit. In our API, it gets used immediately, which might actually be better. We can also reroll the shop for $3, but I only have $6 total. If I reroll once, there's a chance I could find a better joker or voucher. However, jokers are full, and I could sell something for a stronger joker, like Sock and Buskin or Triboulet. Buying an Arcana pack to attempt to get tarot for more hearts seems like a good idea!\n**Planning to buy an Arcana Pack**\n\nI’m considering buying one Arcana Pack for $4, which leaves me with $2. If I had planned to buy a Joker with a +4 multiplier, that could add up with other multipliers, but my joker slots are full right now. Selling something might help, but all my cards are key items. I know Smiley sells for 2, but I shouldn't sell. After the Arcana Pack, I might get a tarot card to upgrade my deck. So, I’ll definitely go for the Arcana Pack and provide the necessary JSON for the action.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
