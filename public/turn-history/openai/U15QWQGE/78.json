{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the economy in the game. If I play the small blind, I get a $3 reward plus any money from remaining hands, which is great. But if I skip the small blind, I can save for free rerolls later. If I do that, I could still reach the shop after the big blind. However, skipping the big blind means no shop either, and I risk going straight to the boss. This could be tough with only $7.\n**Formulating game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking playing the small blind is best because it allows me to collect money and access the shop. For the big blind, I might skip to focus on orbital if my deck is strong enough for the boss fight. I need to remember that I have to play five cards for the boss, which complicates things with Photograph and Chad. If I play a face card first, I could multiply my score significantly! That strategy could mean really big rewards if I execute it correctly.\n**Assessing flush strategy**\n\nI’m considering how we often play a flush with any five cards, making the first card a face card, which is good for the boss since we also need five cards each hand. This combination could help us surpass the 5000 and 7500 thresholds using Photograph, Chad, and Gift for a nice multiplier.\n\nPlaying the small blind seems beneficial for building my economy, even if I skip the small blind and keep my $7. Ultimately, it’s about making sure I maximize my chances for future purchases or upgrades.\n**Deciding on small blind strategy**\n\nIf I play the small blind, I can visit the shop, which might help me find tarot or planets to improve my deck. However, if I skip the small blind, the D6 tag would give me free rerolls for the next shop, but I'd miss out on the current shop and have to wait until after the big blind. That’s tricky since I'd also consider skipping the big blind for orbital. It looks like playing the small blind might be the best option to ensure I can make necessary purchases.\n**Optimizing gameplay strategy**\n\nI'm considering playing both the small and big blinds to maximize the shops and money since the boss level is at 10,000. Having more shops could provide long-term benefits, even better than small rewards like $3 or $4. The Orbital Tag looks interesting, but it's random and might not boost my flush levels, which is essential since the boss requires five cards. \n\nPlaying the small blind helps trigger the Gift Card’s end-of-round benefits, which is significant for scaling. Given that I’ve got good jokers, I think it’s best to play small blind for the chance to trigger important upgrades and maintain my strong strategy. I’ll proceed with that and keep the intended hand type as flush.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
