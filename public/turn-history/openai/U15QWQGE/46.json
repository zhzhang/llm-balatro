{"reasoning":"**Considering strategy for scoring**\n\nI’m thinking we should aim big to access the shop and earn money. It’s important to consider the boss debuff, especially if there are many spades in an unknown deck. Having access to the shop could give us the chance to make adjustments. With 3,000 chips needed, I believe our scoring method using Photograph and Chad is solid. If played well, we could easily reach 3,000 chips in just a couple of hands.\n**Optimizing joker order**\n\nI’m considering how Chad retriggers the joker category after the first scoring of a card. During this, jokers will trigger again in order. I think Photograph should still apply on retriggers since it triggers with the first face card scored. But if Chad is to the left of Photograph, does he trigger first? Actually, since Chad triggers after scoring, I don’t think order matters. Still, to be safe, I’ll set the joker order as Photograph, Hanging Chad, Gift Card, Mail-in Rebate, and Trading Card.\n**Analyzing joker interactions**\n\nI’m noticing that the Gift Card provides an independent +10 multiplier, while the Mail-in Rebate gives +50 chips. The Trading Card only activates on discard, but the ordering of independent jokers doesn't affect the additive multipliers. However, Photograph has a multiplicative effect of x2, but it won’t multiply the +10 from the Gift Card since independent jokers apply later. To be safe, I'll rearrange the jokers in the order of Photograph, Chad, Gift Card, Mail-in Rebate, and Trading Card for optimal scoring.\n**Deciding on next action**\n\nI’m considering the Mail-in Rebate, which gives +50 chips independently, while Trading Cards only activate on discard. The independent triggers should apply left-to-right, but since there aren’t any multipliers involved, I don't think rearranging is necessary. However, it doesn't hurt to rearrange, and I’d prefer to play the round instead of wasting time. So, I’ll choose to play the round now. I need to output this in a specific JSON format with action details.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
