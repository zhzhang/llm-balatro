{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card order strategy**\n\nI’m planning to stick to a flush by choosing 5 cards of the same suit, which seems the easiest route. Before starting a round, I need to arrange the jokers optimally since the order impacts how scoring works. Currently, my card order is Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, Bloodstone, and Hanging Chad. I wonder how that affects our triggers. It looks like I want Smiley to come before Photograph and Bloodstone for the best scoring sequence. This way, I maximize my score by benefitting from both additive and multiplicative bonuses.\n**Analyzing scoring order**\n\nI’m considering the order of Photograph and Bloodstone while thinking about multiplicative triggers. Since Photograph can trigger multiple times and counts for each scoring event of the first played face card, the order might still matter if they trigger in the same scoring event. However, both can multiply, and since multiplication is commutative, my current order looks fine. But, I’m wondering if I should move Hanging Chad earlier for better retriggering. The order of retrigger jokers definitely matters if multiple are in play during scoring.\n**Deciding on card sequence**\n\nSince there's only one joker, the order isn’t relevant right now. However, during the retrigger stage, the order of jokers matters since they’re activated left-to-right. It looks like Hanging Chad should be the leftmost among the retriggering jokers, but again, there's only one, so I don’t need to rearrange anything. As for using The Lovers consumable before the round, it seems I can't target a card during a blind selection, so it’s best to skip using that and just play the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
