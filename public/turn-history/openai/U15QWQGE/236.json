{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card multipliers**\n\nI'm figuring out the multiplayer effects for a game. The base chips seem to be around 125, and there are no extra chips like foil or holo present on the cards. So, for Ancient cards, each heart card played gives a x1.5 multiplier when scored, and with five hearts, that results in a multiplier of 7.59375. \n\nFor the Photograph card, it adds a x2 multiplier the first time it's scored. This means it triggers each scoring for that card, creating a global multiplier effect rather than a per card one. Each retrigger could double the multiplier significantly.\n**Considering card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how sock and seltzer can cause retriggers for cards, allowing those triggers and ancient multipliers to repeat each time. With each score, there's a x1.5 multiplier, meaning retriggers can significantly increase the multiplier—previously, I got around 104k, and I bet we can beat that easily.\n\nI’m leaning towards playing a heart flush with cards like Q spades wild as heart, K hearts, J hearts, 10 hearts, and 5 hearts. This avoids some powerful cards that aren't hearts, but I wonder if we should integrate some foil/holo cards too—wait, we can only play five.\n**Evaluating three of a kind jacks**\n\nI’m considering playing a three-of-a-kind with jacks. I think the best combo would be J hearts lucky, J clubs, and foil J clubs, plus Q diamonds for the holo bonus and K hearts as a kicker. In three-of-a-kind, only the jacks will contribute chips. \n\nSo, with a base multiplier of 110 and jacks contributing 30 chips, that totals 140. The foil jack adds extra multipliers and chips when scored, and since sock and seltzer triggers face cards, they all benefit. However, ancient may only trigger hearts like J hearts and K hearts, affecting the multiplier.\n**Comparing hand strategies**\n\nI’m comparing two strategies: hearts flush versus three of a kind. The flush has a great multiplier of x1.5 per card, and retriggers can make it even more powerful. Without Pareidolia, the photo and sock effects could still apply to three face cards, while seltzer triggers all cards. \n\nThe base multiplier for the flush is 10, almost on par with the three of a kind, which is 11. I’m leaning towards the flush again since it seems strong overall. The Queen of spades can act as a wild card too, so even if Pareidolia is disabled, it's still useful. We want to play the strongest hand to maximize our chances of winning!\n**Strategizing card plays and consumables**\n\nI’m considering whether to use consumables before playing. The Magician can make two selected cards lucky, and I might apply that to K hearts and wild Q spades to potentially increase my multiplier or win. Since we have four hands available, playing flush seems likely to win. \n\nNext, I’m thinking about using Chariot to turn a card into Steel. Steel cards boost multipliers, but I’ll need to play a strong hand with five cards. I have eight cards in hand, so I can keep some unplayed, like the Jack of Clubs or Queen of Diamonds, which I'll make Steel. Enhancements apply while held, so it’s worth it! Additionally, I’ll use the Magician to make the Q spades and K hearts lucky. Overall, these strategies should maximize our chances against the boss.\n**Reviewing consumable usage and card strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether using consumables counts as a \"hand\" for the boss effect. Since we select hands before playing, I believe we can use them safely. I plan to use Chariot on a card I’ll keep in hand, adding the Steel effect, and use Magician to make K hearts and 5 hearts lucky for a chance at +20 multipliers or $20. \n\nHowever, I should avoid overwriting the Wild attribute on Q spades. Making Jack of Clubs Steel is sensible—it loses no other enhancement since I'm not playing it. When we play the flush with hearts, the order will affect how the Photograph effect triggers, maximizing our chances at multipliers. Timing with Lucky triggers will be crucial since that could double the multiplier! This strategy seems promising!\n**Optimizing card order and strategy**\n\nI'm weighing the importance of the order of my face cards to maximize multipliers. Since Photograph only applies to the first face card scored, I want that to be a lucky card like J Hearts or K Hearts. \n\nI plan to apply Chariot to Jack of Clubs to make it Steel, which will enhance my multiplier while keeping it in hand. I’ll also use Magician to make K Hearts and 5 Hearts lucky. Given the seltzer effect and previous gameplay context, I think we're set up to win without needing to rearrange too much, as we expect to exceed 100k in chips easily. Let's confirm this strategy!\n**Mapping out joker strategy and actions**\n\nI'm considering how the order of my jokers affects scoring, especially with Photograph and Ancient. Photograph only triggers for the first played face card, while Ancient multiplies based on heart suit cards. \n\nIf I play them in the right order, I can maximize their effects. I need to use consumables first—Chariot and Magician—to enhance my cards. I'll start with Chariot on card 6, which is safe since it won't overwrite a wild card. Next, I can use Magician on cards two and five.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,6]"}
