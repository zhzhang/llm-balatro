{"reasoning":"**Calculating card probabilities**\n\nI think we’re starting with just a high card, but there’s a chance for a heart flush if I draw two more hearts. With three discards left, I’m aiming to achieve that flush in one or two tries. I’ve got 38 cards left in the deck and 15 hearts. If I keep three hearts and discard five non-hearts, the probability of drawing at least two hearts from my next five cards is around 0.55. That feels promising!\n**Considering card combinations**\n\nI’m exploring the option to play a hand with five cards, including three hearts and two forming a pair, like a pair of 2s with 2♠ and 2♥. That gives a base multiplier of 2 and chips worth 10. But with only one heart (2♥) for Ancient hearts, I only get a 1.5x multiplier. I think focusing on achieving a flush seems better since it multiplies by 10 for the base chips. Each heart gives a 1.5 multiplier, so scoring five hearts substantially boosts my score!\n**Planning the card strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about starting with the K♥, which gives me 10 chips as my highest scoring heart. If I achieve a flush with all five cards, they would all score, and the Photograph would apply when I score the K♥, giving me a 2x multiplier. Plus, with Chad retriggering that card for two additional scores, it could lead to a total of three scoring events for the K♥, making for a cumulative multiplier of x8 and additional boosts from Ancient hearts. My goal is to exceed 16,500, so I’ll discard some cards to find two more hearts. Should I keep the 9♦ glass?\n**Considering card options**\n\nI’m weighing the value of the glass card (9♦) since it provides a x2 multiplier when scored, but it’s a diamond, so it won’t trigger Ancient hearts. It might be useful as the first scoring card for additional bonuses from Photograph and Chad, though. If I aim for a flush with hearts, I can't keep the glass. However, if I miss hearts, having the glass could allow me to form strong combinations, like a pair of 9s. So, should I hold onto it or discard it?\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI’m considering my discard strategy. I could keep the glass as a backup and discard three non-hearts, but that reduces the chance of drawing two hearts. Discarding four non-hearts allows me to draw four new cards, giving me a probability of at least two hearts that’s a bit low at about 41%. So, it seems best to discard five and focus on maximizing my flush chance. I’ll go ahead and discard the 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 cards. \n\nI also wonder about the order of jokers. Since Photograph and Ancient trigger on scoring events, I’m realizing that their order could affect the total score. I think Chad should come last in this scenario to ensure I get the most out of my scoring.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,7,8]"}
