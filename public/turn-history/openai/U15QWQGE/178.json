{"reasoning":"**Choosing tarot options**\n\nI'm looking at the tarot pack after getting the Arcana pack. I need to pick one tarot card: the Lovers (wild card), the Devil (gold card), or Strength (rank +1). I'm focused on creating a flush with Bloodstone hearts and some other cards. The wild card would help in completing flushes since it can act as any suit, but I’m curious if it counts as a heart for the Bloodstone effect. I think it does!\n**Evaluating tarot options**\n\nThe Lovers card is appealing since it can turn a high chip card into a wild card, which helps create a flush and trigger Bloodstone effects. The Devil gives a gold card but doesn't affect scoring, while Strength only slightly increases rank. I think I'd prefer the Lovers, but I should apply it to a plain face card like the Queen of Spades or Jack of Diamonds instead of the King of Hearts, to maintain the existing multiplier enhancement.\n**Choosing a wild face card**\n\nI’m deciding to make a wild face card from the Photograph while considering that Pareidolia affects all face cards, so the distinction isn't crucial. I want to keep my chips in mind since face cards have a base value of 10 chips. I think the best move is to apply the Lovers effect to the Queen of Spades, as it's a strong face card. So, I’ll go with card 1 from the pack and target it for my action.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1]"}
