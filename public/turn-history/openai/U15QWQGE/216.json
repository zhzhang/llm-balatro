{"reasoning":"**Considering card selection strategies**\n\nI'm working with a standard pack that includes specific cards: 8♦, 2♥, and A♠. My strategy is based on building flushes, using Pareidolia to turn everything into face cards, increasing multipliers with Smiley. The synergy here is interesting, especially since the right first card can greatly impact scoring. The Steel Ace could provide a good multiplier if I keep it in hand, but it might limit my ability to form flushes. The Wild 2♥ is versatile, great for completing flushes, and adds value as a face card.\n**Analyzing Steel Ace benefits**\n\nThe Steel Ace offers a valuable multiplicative bonus that can significantly enhance scoring. If I can keep it in hand during scoring, it improves my overall multiplier by 1.5, which is excellent compared to the Wild 2. As long as I manage my hand size, I can hold on to it effectively. Plus, it provides an extra 11 chips. While drawing it repetitively increases deck variance, I think I’d still prefer to select the Steel Ace for its benefits. I'll go ahead and select three cards!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
