{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nI'm analyzing a decent scoring set, and I think replacing it might not be necessary. I need to improve hand scaling. The Spectral card can create powerful effects, but it can also backfire. In the ante2 game, I’d go with Spectral for quick gains. Money isn't my priority; I could sell cards later if better options arise. I’m planning to buy a Spectral Pack and considering the order of jokers strategically for optimal scoring. It's crucial to think about how and when the jokers trigger for the best results.\n**Rearranging card order**\n\nI’m thinking about how the order of triggering matters when both jokers activate on the same card. It’s better to have the +3 bonus first before the x2 multiplier for maximum benefit. Therefore, I should position the Lusty joker to the left of the Photograph. Other jokers, like the Gift Card and Mail-in Rebate, don’t depend on order. The Trading card triggers when discarded, which is separate. So, I’ll rearrange the jokers now, putting Lusty before Photograph to optimize scoring!\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI’m considering the next steps—do I buy a booster now or rearrange the cards first? Rearranging can happen at any time in the shop, so it may not be urgent. Typically, I’d buy a booster first to see how it might affect the jokers, especially with possibilities like Aura or Wraith. But for now, I think it’s best to just go ahead and buy the booster. So, let's proceed with buying the booster as my next move!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
