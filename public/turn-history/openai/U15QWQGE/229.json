{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop actions**\n\nI need to figure out our next shop action before the final boss round. It's round 16, ante 8, and we want to maximize our score. We have a solid flush build with abilities like Pareidolia turning cards into faces, plus the Smiley bonus for face cards. We should consider buying the Ancient Joker, which boosts our Hearts multiplier, or possibly the Fortune Teller. I’ll keep an eye on our strategies to ensure we can beat the final boss effectively!\n**Considering card strategies**\n\nI’m evaluating if I can create a flush with Hearts, which would multiply points by 1.5 each time a card is scored, and retriggers could really ramp up our score. The Ancient Joker seems promising for this strategy. However, it requires matching suits, so I’ll need to focus on getting Hearts. I can manipulate some cards using Star to convert suits, but let’s face it, we don’t know the deck composition. I'll buy the Ancient Joker and try to form that flush. Now, which joker should I sell? Maybe Smiley?\n**Evaluating card value**\n\nI’m weighing whether to keep Smiley, which adds +5 per scoring face card, but I’m realizing the multiplicative score from Ancient might outperform that in the long run. If I lose Pareidolia, I’d miss out on maximum triggers since Smiley and Sock would only affect actual face cards. So, Pareidolia seems essential! I’d keep Chad and Photograph since they’re core for triggering, so Smiley looks like the most replaceable option. Even with its additive score, it might not stack up as well in the end.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nSo, with a base flush multiplier of 10, it jumps to 70 overall. Photograph doubles the score when the first face card scores and retriggers each time that card scores, multiplying by x2 with each instance. Smiley provides an additive +5 for each scored card, which occurs before Photograph gets to apply its multiplier. If I replace Smiley with Ancient, I'll have to think about their positions, but since both are multiplicative, I realize the order won’t matter because multiplication commutes.\n**Deciding next actions**\n\nI’m thinking selling Smiley for the Ancient Joker seems like a solid plan. The Ancient costs $8, so I can directly purchase it since I have $28, but I still need to free up a slot first. I should probably sell Smiley first, then buy Ancient. I’m considering the Fortune Teller too for its constant +15 multiplier, but it’s additive and doesn’t require face cards. Ultimately, I should focus on maximizing my hand for the final boss, possibly selling Smiley to make space for Ancient. That feels right!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
