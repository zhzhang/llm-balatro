{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategies**\n\nLosing a key face card could be tough, but it might lead to creating more opportunities. I see that Stuntman reduces hand size, so we’re currently down to 6 cards. The first card in the Chad + Photo combo is essential, so I want to make it solid—like a glass King. We’re full on jokers, so if we want the Glass Joker, I need to consider selling one, but I’m hesitant. The potential multiplier from the Glass Joker is appealing, but we need to design a strategy!\n**Evaluating card strategies and upgrades**\n\nIf glass breaks after scoring, our hand's total might already have a x2 multiplier from the glass, Photograph, and other cards. The Glass Joker could boost future hands. I should consider buying Neptune or Saturn since they don’t require targets and don’t occupy inventory space. Neptune upgrades Straight Flush, but we rarely play that; Saturn only upgrades Straight. Our main is Flush, currently at level 4, so Jupiter would be better. The Star tarot's need for targets complicates things, as I would have to sell Justice or Wraith for space.\n**Analyzing suit conversion strategies**\n\nSuit conversion tarots could help maintain our flush, but with a hand size of 6 from Stuntman, it’s a bit trickier. I wonder if we were using hearts for flush earlier; the pack had an Ace of hearts. But switching to diamonds via Star might not be the best idea. I’m considering using Wraith, but it sets our money to 0, which is better saved for the end of shopping sessions. However, this would consume a slot, and we’re already full on jokers, so we’d need to sell one first! If we sell Mail-In Rebate, then we can use Wraith to gain a rare joker.\n**Deciding on consumable use and purchases**\n\nI'm considering when to use Wraith: during a shop phase or in a round. Since Wraith doesn’t require hand targets, I could use it now, but it sets our money to 0, so it should be after other purchases. We have $17, so maybe it's okay to spend. Now, I’m unsure if replacing Mail-In Rebate with Glass Joker is wise. I might also think about buying Saturn or the Standard Pack to add face cards, which could be helpful for my scoring potential. For instance, playing a flush with a face card first could trigger some valuable multipliers!\n**Optimizing scoring and card strategies**\n\nI’m analyzing how the x2 multiplier from Photograph applies when a face card is scored, especially if retriggered. If we retrigger multiple times, that could lead to an x8 multiplier, which is massive! The Gift Card and its potential +10 multiplier also come into play. My chip totals could skyrocket if I strategically combine these effects. \n\nI consider using Justice to create a glass card, likely a face card, for high scoring. Although Stuntman adds chips but reduces hand size, I think I can manage a flush with careful planning. I’ll keep him for now since he’s valuable for early chip accumulation!\n**Evaluating card options and strategies**\n\nI'm weighing the viability of the Mail-In Rebate for economic gains versus the potential benefits of the Glass Joker for scaling. Given my current funds, I need to consider the cost of planets like Saturn and Neptune, even though they're not my focus. Having a secondary hand type might be useful if bosses debuff my flush. \n\nI should also think about the order of my jokers when scoring. It seems that the placement of cards like Gift Card, Hanging Chad, and Photograph can affect my multipliers. Prioritizing additive multipliers before multiplicative ones makes sense, especially since my goal is to maximize scoring effectiveness with the Glass Joker. Now, I just need to decide whether to buy the Glass Joker right away or consider alternative strategies!\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI'm considering my options, but my consumable slots are full, which makes it tricky to buy the Star without selling something first or using Wraith. If I sell the Mail-In Rebate, I could buy the Glass Joker, but that doesn't leave me room for Wraith's outcome. However, using Wraith to generate a rare joker could be a good alternative, though it sets my money to zero.\n\nPerhaps in the long run, selling Mail-In Rebate for the Glass Joker makes sense because it offers guaranteed synergy. After selling, I'll have enough to buy Saturn and/or Neptune to strengthen my straights. But do I really want to wait for future sales? For now, I think I should prioritize buying the Glass Joker and hold off on using Wraith until I have more money. I need to keep my interest up for better future options!\n**Planning actions carefully**\n\nI realize that using Wraith makes my money drop to zero, so I should wait and spend down to near zero before using it to avoid losing out. I think the best first action is to sell the Mail-In Rebate, then buy the Glass Joker and rearrange my cards. However, I can only perform one action each turn, so I'll sell the Joker now and save the buy for later.\n\nI could also consider selling Wraith or Justice to make space for The Star, but that's not necessary right now. So, I'll proceed with selling the Joker.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
