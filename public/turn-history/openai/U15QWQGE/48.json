{"reasoning":"**Evaluating Photograph mechanics**\n\nI’m trying to understand how the Photograph mechanic works in conjunction with face cards. It seems like it triggers on the first played face card scored, giving a multiplier. If the first played face card is a Jack, it gets doubled when it scores. The Hanging Chad also seems to retrigger, possibly causing Photograph to double the score again. In theory, this could lead to an x8 multiplier if certain conditions are met, which is intriguing!\n**Calculating chip totals and multipliers**\n\nI'm estimating the total chips from a two pair level 1 scenario. It looks like the base chips are 20, and I’ll add the rank of each scored card: 8+8+4+4+10 for the Jack, totaling 54. If the Mail-In Rebate joker adds another 50, that brings the total to 104. The base multiplier is 2, but Photograph could double the multiplier for scoring the Jack. With the Hanging Chad retriggering, I might end up with a multiplier of 16, plus the Gift Card would add 10.\n**Finalizing calculations for chip totals**\n\nI'm calculating the chips and multipliers after scoring, aiming for a total of 2704 with a base of 104 and a multiplier of 26. I think I need to check if the Mail-In Rebate's +50 chips applies every hand, and whether other cards increase the base chips—turns out they don’t. If I play a high card like a Jack alone, that gives me 65 total chips and a multiplier of 18 when considering each scoring. But two pairs might still not add up to the needed 3000 chips to win.\n**Considering discards and scoring strategies**\n\nLooking at my cards, I have clubs 3, 4, and Jack, plus hearts 8 and 6, and diamonds Ace and 8. With only three clubs, I might need to discard for better options. I can play two hands, aiming for two pairs in the first with the Jack to boost Photograph. The deck has many face cards, around a 24% chance to draw. Alternatively, using Justice on the Jack could double multipliers. This could lead to a massive multiplier effect with both Justice and Photograph, potentially reaching 3000 points in one go!\n**Deciding on using Justice and scoring strategy**\n\nJustice has a 1 in 4 chance to destroy the Jack, which could hurt my strategy if that happens, though losing one face card might be manageable. Instead of saving it for later, I’m leaning towards using Justice on the Jack of Clubs now to maximize my chances with Photograph and Hanging Chad. If I compute the scores, it seems I can end up with over 14,000 chips, which is great for beating the blind. Using Justice now could still leave me with enough resources for future hands, so I’ll go ahead and use it.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,4]"}
