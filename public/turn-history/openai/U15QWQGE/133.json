{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker replacements**\n\nI'm considering which current joker to replace. Swash sounds like a candidate since it generates a +28 multiplier but is tied to other cards. If I replace it with Hiker, I'd lose that multiplier but gain scaling chips, which isn’t great for the immediate future. I ponder other options, but nothing seems better. Should I just reroll for consumables or planets instead? The shop only shows jokers right now. Maybe there are more card slots available than I realize.\n**Considering reroll options**\n\nI’m thinking that rerolling might reveal planets available for purchase. We currently have one empty consumable slot, and adding a planet could improve our hand type. A three of a kind at level 5 seems to be the best while a flush is at level 4. The planets correspond to specific hand types in Balatro: Mercury for Pair, Venus for Three of a Kind, and Earth for Full House. I wonder if I can reroll until I find Jupiter, Venus, or Earth. No worries, we have enough money!\n**Optimizing joker arrangement**\n\nI’m thinking about buying tarot to enhance my deck, particularly to create more wild cards, although with Ancient removed, there might be less need for that. I also want to rearrange the jokers to ensure optimal trigger order. Photograph triggers a x2 multiplier when a face card is scored, while Hanging Chad retriggers the first played scoring card for an extra bonus. I should ensure that the first scoring card is the one I want to retrigger, maybe something high-value like the Ace. Each joker triggers in categories, so managing their order is key!\n**Understanding joker mechanics**\n\nIt seems there's a specific joker effect regarding how cards score from left to right, with each card triggering various elements. The order of Photograph versus Chad really matters here. Chad retriggers a card, while Photograph triggers on scoring. If Photograph is played first, it could apply its x2 multiplier before Chad does its retriggering effect. Clarifying that Chad triggers after scoring helps me understand its role better. So, it looks like the sequence is important: played cards score, then enhancements, followed by the jokers triggering in order!\n**Deciding on joker order and strategy**\n\nIt seems the order may not matter much between Photograph and Chad. Chad operates in the retriggers stage, while Photograph functions during the on-scored stage, but I realize Photograph still triggers every time the card is scored, including during retriggers. Great! Since we only have Photograph as an on-scored joker, I think I need to consider that.  \n\nSwashbuckler and Stuntman, being independent jokers, trigger their effects left to right. Stuntman adds +250 chips and Swash adds a +28 multiplier. So, their order might not matter since they affect different components.  \n\nHowever, any joker that multiplies affects order—though not in this case. So, my best strategy now is to reroll for planets, consumables, or possibly find better jokers like Blueprint or Brainstorm. I have enough money to reroll multiple times and potentially find useful tarot cards too. Let’s reroll!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
