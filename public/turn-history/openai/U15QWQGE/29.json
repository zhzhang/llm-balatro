{"reasoning":"**Deciding on actions**\n\nI need to choose an action in a shop where I have no purchases, and with only $2, I can't afford the $3 reroll. So, I’ll finish the shop and move to round selection. I’m wondering if I could sell jokers to increase my money for interest, but selling would reduce my power, and $2 is a small amount to work with. Since I have an investment tag for $25 after defeating the boss, I'll keep the jokers and go for round selection. I'll return the URL in JSON format.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
