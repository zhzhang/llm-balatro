{"reasoning":"**Evaluating gift card scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm working through the mechanics of how a gift card applies to scoring. It seems that adding a dollar of sell value can trigger a stage, but we can also reorder jokers at the same stage. It looks like our scoring heavily relies on multipliers from different components, which can potentially allow multiple scoring instances on retriggers. Each time a card is scored, the photograph effect could activate for double multipliers. So, yes, I believe that’s how it works!\n**Planning card scoring strategies**\n\nI'm looking at how the ancient trigger works for scoring when the first card is a spade to get the multiplier. I need to see the current hand, but I can't skip the boss round. So my action is to play the round, but I might also want to rearrange jokers for the best triggers. The order of the retriggering jokers matters, especially with Hanging Chad. I should consider going with Pareidolia first, even if it’s passive. However, I can't sell a joker to buy something right now, so I'll just focus on playing.\n**Planning round actions**\n\nIn this round, I need to play exactly 5 cards for each hand, and I’ll need 10,000 chips. Based on the previous big blind pair scoring, which was 20,332 chips, it seems like I should be alright. So, the next step is to respond with the action in JSON format for playing the round. It looks like things are falling into place, and I'm ready to proceed!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
