{"reasoning":"**Analyzing scoring multipliers**\n\nSo, I’m thinking through the mechanics of Photograph, where the first played face card gives a 2x multiplier when scored. With Chad, it can retrigger two more times, meaning that each time it scores, it also triggers the multiplier again. I assume that this effectively stacks, leading to a multiplier of 8 overall. \n\nIf I'm replacing Swash with Crafty, the multiplier decreases to a base of 11, but Photograph still offers a higher total. Though, interestingly, Zany adds 12 to the multiplier if there are trips in the hand.\n**Evaluating card replacements**\n\nI’m considering whether to replace Swash, but the multiplier of 23 (11+12) times 8 gives 184, which is lower than the 312 from 39 times 8. If I replace Stuntman, I’d lose 250 chips, which isn't ideal. There's also the misprint chance with Balatro that might provide random multipliers, but that feels too risky. \n\nPluto levels the high card, which isn't the main focus but could still be handy. It's a cheap option at $3 and could assist against certain bosses since it offers +1 multiplier and +10 chips at Level 1.\n**Considering consumable options**\n\nBuying Pluto would take up a consumable slot, and I'm really thinking it might be better to look for a more beneficial planet like Venus. I have $41, and the reroll costs $5, so I’m wondering if I should buy Pluto now and then reroll. However, I might miss out on a better consumable later. \n\nI could sell Pluto for what I think is likely $1, so it might be wiser to skip the purchase. Instead, I could reroll for a better joker, but I’d need to swap first since my joker slots are full. With the current reroll cost set at $5, I can do about 6-7 rerolls.\n**Evaluating joker options**\n\nI'm considering searching for a powerful joker to replace Swash, which is only a medium card. Possible replacements could be Cavendish or Lucky Cat. However, since we're at Ante 6 and need to defeat bosses 6, 7, and 8, I’m thinking we need strong scaling for the late game. Our current build is already focused on multipliers, but I might want to add other xMult sources like Baseball Card or Blackboard.\n\nIf I reroll for rare cards, I have to keep in mind that each reroll increases the cost. I should probably save some money for possible booster packs, which might only show up after rerolls. From what I understand about Balatro, rerolls affect the card section only, so it might be worth it to see other options like tarot, planets, or spectral cards. Plus, since I already have the Lovers, it could make a good wild card!\n**Deciding on upgrades and rerolls**\n\nSince we’re at ante 6, I think it makes sense to proceed to the round and save money for interest. I could buy Pluto as a cheap improvement, which might not hurt much, but it only affects the high card, which isn’t always useful. Instead, it seems better to reroll for planets like Venus or Jupiter, as they significantly increase base chips and multipliers.\n\nThough I could buy Pluto, I might want to keep that consumable slot open. Plus, if I find a better planet, I'd prefer to have the option to swap. I think rerolling for a relevant planet or tarot card is the way to go!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
