{"reasoning":"**Clarifying game mechanics**\n\nI'm sorting through the rules about the stone card, which has +50 chips but no rank or suit. It can contribute to scoring when it participates in the highest hand, but it doesn't count in hand formation. So it might affect the ability to form five-card types. It could help in a high card situation, but it probably won't participate since it lacks rank. I need to think about how consumables like Justice relate too; not used yet, but I noticed a glass J before.\n**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI'm a bit confused about the glass J♣ in hand and whether Justice has been used. I still have the Justice consumable, but did the glass J♣ come from an earlier Justice? The inventory suggests it hasn’t been used yet, but it's possible the glass was acquired from a pack instead. The Justice can create another glass card, which could be advantageous for multipliers. I'm also considering that the glass has a 1 in 4 destruction risk, and retriggers might amplify that risk. However, this could lead to big numbers if I'm careful!\n**Deciding on Wraith usage**\n\nI'm considering whether to use the Wraith spectral now to create a random rare joker. With $22, using it might lose some money but could yield a strong joker, potentially better than what I already have. However, it takes up a slot. Since we have two open slots, it might be wise to buy key jokers like Pareidolia and Smiley first. After that, I could think about booster packs. Importantly, I need to spend all my money before using the Wraith since it sets my money to $0!\n**Strategizing card purchases**\n\nI’m thinking about buying Pareidolia and Smiley, maybe a couple of booster packs, and then possibly rerolling for good jokers. I could save the Wraith for last, but using it would consume a slot. It might fetch a rare joker, which could add value like Blueprint or Brainstorm, though it’s a risk. Setting my money to $0 is a big opportunity cost, but if I spend most first, the risk goes down. With our current cards, I think we could combine well for a strong strategy!\n**Optimizing strategy with jokers**\n\nI’m analyzing the use of jokers like Smiley and Photograph to maximize multipliers. Smiley gives +5 for face cards with Pareidolia, which would ramp up the score significantly if played right. I’d want to ensure Smiley triggers before Photograph for better scaling. I should also consider the order of my retriggering jokers like Chad since they affect scoring separately. For purchases, I plan to buy both Pareidolia and Smiley while keeping an eye on capacity. I may need to sell something to make room for a rare joker from Wraith later!\n**Evaluating joker strategy**\n\nI’m debating whether to use Wraith for a potential rare joker versus buying Pareidolia and Smiley for immediate synergy. Photograph, Chad, and Smiley provide good multipliers, but I’m concerned about scaling in future rounds. I can buy both key cards, leaving no room for Wraith right now. It's better to buy Pareidolia and Smiley first, then reconsider Wraith later. Since I’ll have 5 jokers, I could sell one later if necessary. Prioritizing consistent scoring seems key since there's a Big Blind and Boss ahead — let's proceed with that plan!\n**Clarifying joker placement**\n\nI’m thinking about the order of my jokers and how positioning affects scoring and retriggering. Hanging Chad is indeed a retrigger joker, which means positioning it matters during scoring. I’ll set my order as Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Pareidolia, and then Gift Card. Since Pareidolia is passive, its position isn’t critical, and I definitely want to keep Gift for its sell value and multiplier. My next step will be to buy Pareidolia first, so I’ll go ahead with that!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
