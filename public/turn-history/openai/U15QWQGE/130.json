{"reasoning":"**Considering Chaos the Clown**\n\nI'm in the shop thinking about the current build after buying Saturn. Chaos the Clown is the only option left, but I'd need to sell something since my jokers are full. I find my current cards—Photograph, Hanging Chad, Pareidolia, Ancient, Swash—are strong. Chaos offers a free reroll, but I'm weighing its value against my setup. Ancient is situational but still strong. I’m trying to analyze how each card interacts, especially with scoring dynamics and triggers.\n**Evaluating Card Synergy**\n\nI’m analyzing how Photograph works—it triggers on scored face cards for a x2 multiplier, with Chad potentially amplifying this to x8 across scoring events. Ancient triggers with spade cards, also providing a solid multiplier. It seems synergy is vital here: I need the first scored card to be both a spade and a face card. My suits can change, but I can't drop Swash for its +33 multiplier, nor Pareidolia or Hanging Chad for their crucial synergies. Chaos doesn't seem worth losing any of these valuable jokers.\n**Weighing Options for Chaos**\n\nI'm contemplating whether to sell Swash for $2 to buy Chaos for $4, which offers a free reroll. This could help me find a better joker, like Blueprint, but I already have $47 and can reroll without needing more jokers. Chaos might improve search efficiency, but losing the +33 multiplier from Swash could impact my survival since I need high scores for the upcoming bosses. I think keeping my current setup is best. I can still reroll in the shop for planets or tarots, which might enhance my chances further.\n**Deciding on Consumables**\n\nI’m checking my consumable slots—they’re almost full with only Lovers and one empty. A reroll could reveal valuable planets for three of a kinds or flushes, but there's no booster available. I have $47, and since rerolls cost $3 now after adjustments, I can afford a few. Usually, I’d reroll until I find strong consumables like planets or tarots, but since I can’t buy Chaos without selling something, I think my best move is to reroll for better options.\n**Planning My Next Move**\n\nBefore leaving the shop, I’m considering if I need to buy anything. I’ve already used Saturn, and I might reroll the shop 1-2 times. Choosing the next action, I think rerolling is the best option to find planets that could help upgrade to flushes or three-of-a-kinds, which boost my base chips and multipliers. I remember planets like Venus for three-of-a-kind and various tarot cards might be useful too. With $47, I can afford up to 7 rerolls, so that sounds like my next move!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
