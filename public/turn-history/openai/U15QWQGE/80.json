{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm in the shop after winning a small blind, and I need to decide on my purchases. I have a strong engine made up of Photograph, Chad, Gift, Stuntman, and Acrobat. With the upcoming big blind of 10,000, I need to plan since the boss requires playing 5 cards per hand. Our hand size is reduced by Stuntman, likely making it 6 instead of the standard 8. I need to remember that Photograph doubles the score when the first played face card is scored, while Chad retriggers scoring.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI realized that the x2 multiplier can stack up to x8 when considering Pareidolia, which makes all cards treated as face cards. This is great since it ensures that any first played card will trigger Photograph. With the boss requiring 5 cards, I can play any five cards to ensure that the first card triggers Photograph. Smiley Face boosts the score further by +5 for each face card, and with Chad retriggering the first card, I have to think about which to replace since I'm at max joker capacity. My earlier scoring estimation might have been off, but with the boss's requirement, a single-card strategy won't cut it.\n**Reevaluating joker setup**\n\nI need to come up with a new joker setup. Potential additions could include Pareidolia, which costs 5, Smiley Face at 4, and Superposition at 4. I also noticed that Tower tarot is a consumable, not a joker. I might consider selling Wraith since it might not be useful, or I could save Justice for later. If I buy Pareidolia, I'd need to sell a joker, probably Stuntman, even though it adds +250 chips. But with the boss's requirement of 5 cards, reduced hand size from Stuntman could hurt, even though I have a strong multiplier. If I can get flushes, it might still be enough to reach 10k!\n**Planning joker changes**\n\nOkay, I’m working with some strong multipliers here. Photograph can give an x8 boost, while Acrobat adds x3 for the final hand. Gift can give a +10 multiplier, and Smiley Face adds even more. For the boss, aiming for a full house could work, but a flush seems easier with enough hearts available. Though I don’t need Pareidolia for a flush, it ensures Photograph always triggers. I think I'll sell Stuntman and buy Pareidolia and Smiley Face to maximize my score!\n**Analyzing joker options**\n\nI’m exploring my current jokers and their value. Photograph is crucial for multipliers, while Hanging Chad retriggers the first scoring card, working well with Photograph. Gift Card holo gives a +10 multiplier and boosts other jokers' values at the end of the round. Acrobat provides x3 for the final hand, which could be beneficial in tougher rounds, but Stuntman’s hand size penalty makes it less appealing. \n\nI’m considering selling Stuntman for Pareidolia and maybe Smiley Face, examining scoring for flush hands. With my current setup, I could reach substantial scores, possibly hitting 10k easily. Although I need consistency for the boss that requires 5 cards, I’m feeling confident that with the right changes, I can secure a winning strategy!\n**Evaluating joker strategy**\n\nI'm weighing the options for my jokers since Stuntman reduces hand size, which might not be ideal for the boss that requires five cards. Selling him for Pareidolia makes sense as it doesn't reduce hand size. Now, should I sell Acrobat for Smiley Face instead? Acrobat provides a solid x3 multiplier for the final hand, while Smiley Face offers a +5 multiplier per card. \n\nIf I keep Acrobat and add Smiley, maybe I can find a balance by dropping another joker like Hanging Chad. But Chad synergizes well with Photograph, making me hesitant to replace it. It's tough to choose!\n**Analyzing multipliers and joker strategy**\n\nI’m considering my current multipliers without Smiley Face. The base multiplier for a flush is 10, and with the Gift it goes to 20, then Photograph multiplies by 8 for 160, leading to 480 total with Acrobat. If I use Smiley instead of Acrobat, the multiplier becomes around 360—not quite as high.\n\nI must think about selling Wraith for cash and future purchases. Selling Stuntman gives room for Pareidolia or Smiley Face. I want the reliability of Pareidolia to ensure Photograph triggers for scoring, especially for challenging scenarios. Keeping my economy strong matters, too!\n**Evaluating multipliers and card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about using a high card strategy. I want to ensure the first card is the scoring card, but I have options like flush. My plan is to sell Stuntman and buy Pareidolia. Then, I might consider selling the Gift Card to buy Smiley Face. \n\nWith Pareidolia and Smiley, I could achieve a significant multiplier; however, I should evaluate the trade-offs and potential configurations. It seems like keeping the right blend of cards is key for maximizing multipliers and ensuring that I meet my economy goals throughout the game.\n**Analyzing multiplier interactions**\n\nI'm considering how multipliers work with my cards. It seems that after applying the photo multiplier on the first card, Smiley adds points to each subsequent card but isn’t multiplied again. So, the order matters significantly. \n\nWhen I simulate, starting with a base of 10, the final multipliers can change based on how I arrange my cards. It looks like I might want the best combination to maximize scoring. My ideal joker lineup could be Smiley, Photograph, Chad, Pareidolia, and Acrobat, which could yield huge multipliers while providing reliability. I'll need to weigh the benefits of keeping Gift Card versus the potential of maximizing my scores with this setup.\n**Evaluating joker strategies**\n\nTo buy both Pareidolia for $5 and Smiley for $4, I'd need to sell Stuntman. If I sell the Gift Card instead, I can still keep Stuntman while opening a slot for both new cards. \n\nSo, I’m weighing options: keep Stuntman, keep Gift for economy, or focus on maximizing scoring. Selling Smiley and Gift together seems a decent choice for big upgrades. After considering joker order, I'll arrange them as Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Acrobat for the best multiplier interactions. The order influences how certain cards trigger, and I want to leverage that for maximum effect.\n**Deciding on joker actions**\n\nI’m working through the scoring mechanics based on the first card where Smiley boosts the score before the Photograph doubles it, leading to potentially high multipliers. I’m considering whether to sell Stuntman or Gift next. Selling Stuntman opens up space and adds funds, but it’s contributing a significant chip bonus. Perhaps it’s better to sell Gift instead, allowing room for buying Pareidolia and Smiley while keeping Stuntman for its chip value. I'm leaning toward prioritizing the multipliers and overall strategy for future rounds.\n**Weighing hand size and Stuntman**\n\nI realize that a -2 hand size is a significant penalty, but Pareidolia makes every card a face card, which is helpful. However, I still need to consider flush potential since Stuntman adds a good number of chips. While I can play a high card, having a flush seems more reliable for scoring higher multipliers. I’m leaning toward selling Stuntman, even though it’s rare, because having a larger hand might be more beneficial in the long run. So, my next action is to sell Stuntman.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
