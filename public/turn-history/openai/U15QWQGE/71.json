{"reasoning":"**Considering booster purchase options**\n\nIn this situation, buying a booster likely leads to selecting a card. I’ll plan to buy one booster first. Alternatively, if I want a better planet or tarot card, I could reroll. The standard pack is affordable and useful. After purchasing, I’ll have $14 left to keep for interest. I also have a Gift Card that could increase sell values. I need to think about the Wraith card—using it sets my money to zero, so I should manage that carefully!\n**Evaluating joker order and scoring**\n\nI’m thinking about how the order of independent jokers matters. The Gift Card adds a +10 multiplier, and the Glass Joker may be independent too. It's essential to apply these left-to-right. I need the additive multiplier from the Gift Card before the multiplicative effect from the Glass Joker. \n\nSo, the order should probably be Photograph first, then Hanging Chad, followed by the independent ones. Photograph should trigger first since it multiplies the multiplier when a face card is scored.\n**Clarifying joker interactions and scoring**\n\nI’m wrestling with how Photograph and Hanging Chad interact when scoring. If Chad retriggers the face card, doesn't Photograph apply again because it’s tied to the first scored face card? It seems that Photograph triggers on each scoring event. However, the order matters within the same scoring step: if Chad activates before Photograph, does it lead to extra points? \n\nChad retriggers the first card and should come after Photograph in the order. I should also keep the independent jokers well-ordered, ensuring Stuntman chips are added before multipliers like Gift Card and Glass Joker.\n**Finalizing the joker order**\n\nI’ve figured out the order for my jokers: it should be Photograph first, followed by Hanging Chad, then Stuntman, Gift Card, and finally the Glass Joker. It seems that the additive multiplier (+mult) should apply before the multiplicative one (xmult). Luckily, the order matters only within the scoring category for independent effects. \n\nNow, the next step is clear: I need to focus on buying a booster. Let’s get started on crafting the JSON for that!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
