{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker options**\n\nI’m considering rerolling at the shop to find a strong joker like xMult or a blueprint. However, I have max joker slots, which means I’ll need to sell one, possibly either Bull or Smiley. Bull gives +142 chips to every hand, which is great! But selling him might make it harder to reach the boss threshold. I think I might need 1,200,000 chips for the Ante 8 boss, and I’m not entirely sure about the exact numbers yet.\n**Clarifying Balatro thresholds**\n\nI'm trying to clarify chip thresholds in Balatro for antes 1-8. I think the ante 8 small might be 40k, big 60k, and boss 80k, but that seems too low. We scored 104k on the big blind, so the threshold might actually be around 85k, making the boss around 110k. I know the boss is usually higher, maybe double the big blind? Anyway, I plan to reroll for better items, and with my current $71, I can afford several rerolls after covering the costs.\n**Considering tarot options**\n\nI'm looking for tarot cards like Death or Justice to enhance my deck before facing the boss. My consumables are already full, but I can buy tarots and use them immediately if I have no targets. Trouble is, both Justice and Death require targets to activate. I might need to sell either Magician or Hanged Man to clear up space for these. Planets like Jupiter don’t require targets, so I can buy and use those directly. I’m thinking maybe it’s better to reroll without the voucher since it only doubles the tarot appearance, not planets.\n**Optimizing flush strategy**\n\nI'm focusing on the flush, particularly with planet Jupiter that boosts base chips and multipliers. I'm at level 4 now, giving me 80 chips and a 10x multiplier. Additional levels could help, but maybe with diminishing returns. I might want to swap out Smiley for a stronger multiplier joker. Smiley adds +5 multiplier for each face card scored, and with some retriggers, that could significantly increase my score. The photograph card also doubles the multiplier during scoring, enhancing my overall strategy even more. I can see that's going to be crucial!\n**Deciding on joker strategy**\n\nI’m analyzing the cards I have and how to maximize their potential. Pareidolia is crucial because it makes all cards face, allowing Smiley and Photograph to work effectively. Bull helps generate chips, so I need to keep high money for that. While Bull gives +142 chips, Smiley adds +5 to the multiplier for each face card, creating a big impact when I score. I think I should keep both jokers for their benefits, but I might reroll for more consumables or planets while keeping one slot open. Ultimately, I’m planning to reroll now to find Jupiter or powerful items.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
