{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy options**\n\nI’m looking at some game mechanics here. The other two 8s each add +4, bringing a total multiplier to +20, which surpasses the Gift Card's +10. If I swap Gift Card for Even Steven, I'd gain a net +10 multiplier. However, the Gift Card increases sell value at the end of each round, potentially aiding future purchases. The Green Joker starts at 0 but offers minor scaling, while Even Steven seems to be the better choice to consider replacing the Gift Card with Ancient for scoring bonuses.\n**Assessing card strategy**\n\nIn my deck, I have hearts with 14, clubs with 10, spades with 4, and diamonds with 5. So, we likely can build a hand starting with a club. But if the boss debuffs clubs, that changes the game. I wonder if the upcoming boss is The Plant, though I lack information. We just finished a round and will face a boss soon, under ante 5. If The Plant debuffs face cards, that could lead to significant risk, potentially needing a strategy to offset this if we sell Pareidolia.\n**Strategizing card choices**\n\nIf I sell Pareidolia, only the actual face cards would be debuffed, allowing the use of non-face cards. The challenge is that we won’t know the boss until the blind select phase. It might be beneficial to get Even Steven beforehand, in case we need to sell Pareidolia. However, I can only sell items at the shop and not during the boss fight, which complicates things. After shopping, we move directly to blind select where the boss is revealed. Maybe I should consider saving up instead of spending now?\n**Considering purchase options**\n\nI’ve got $4 and could buy The Star to convert cards to diamonds, which might help reduce some risk. However, rerolling the shop is an option but would cost $3, leaving only $1, which isn’t very useful. Buying The Star for $3 as a consumable seems plausible, but I must remember it converts cards and requires targets from my hand. Still, if I buy it as a consumable, I can use it later during the round when my hand is displayed.\n**Analyzing purchase strategies**\n\nI realize I can use tarot during a round by selecting target cards from my hand, which changes things. It might be beneficial if I convert my cards to diamonds, especially with the Ancient suit. But it's tricky since it changes suits every round, and I can't control that. Even Steven costs $4 and seems straightforward, but I'd need to sell a joker first. Selling the Gift Card could give me funds for both Even Steven and Director's Cut, but I can't currently afford the rerolls. I might need to sacrifice Ancient to ensure I can mitigate risks against The Plant.\n**Evaluating boss effects and card values**\n\nI’m considering whether boss effects apply given my setup with Pareidolia. Since Pareidolia makes all cards face cards, that could debuff their chip values but might keep base scores intact. Jokers would still work, so that’s a relief. Photograph’s effects on scoring could still apply since it triggers off of a face card, even if debuffed. Keeping the Gift Card might be essential for its growing sell value and multiplier. \n\nI’m also looking at buying The Star and how it could help to convert cards into diamonds, but timing is crucial because suits change each round. Ultimately, selling a joker like Gift Card might be less beneficial compared to leveraging multipliers from Ancient or Even Steven.\n**Comparing card strategies**\n\nI’m evaluating the potential of Even Steven versus keeping Ancient. Even Steven boosts scores per even card, while Ancient multiplies scores based on the suit match for each card. I’ve seen significant gains from triggering Ancient multiple times with Photograph, especially if we can play club suits first. \n\nHowever, I’m hesitant to sell the Gift Card since it provides a consistent +10 multiplier. Buying the Green Joker or The Star might help, but I need to focus on maximizing a strong hand for the upcoming boss. Holding onto my current resources until after the boss could be the best choice, especially since I expect a solid payout afterward to invest in future strategies.\n**Deciding on strategy for the boss**\n\nI’m considering whether we should use our cash to buy The Star or just save it. The Star converts cards to diamonds, but since we have a heavy hearts deck, that might not help unless we aim for a diamond synergy later. \n\nIf the boss is debuffing clubs, it could impact our Ancient. I’m leaning towards keeping everything as is, valuing the +10 from the Gift Card. My best option might be to proceed to round selection without spending, ensuring I’m prepared for whatever challenge awaits!\n**Evaluating potential card swaps**\n\nI'm thinking about whether we should sell the Gift Card to buy Even Steven or perhaps invest in The Star. The Gift Card offers a +10 multiplier, which is beneficial, but I could sell it for $12 to get Even Steven and a booster pack. The pack could add a powerful card to our deck, and we might find enhanced options. \n\nHowever, losing the Gift Card also means losing its growth value. It’s a tough call since every joker slot is precious, and maximizing multipliers is key for our strategy!\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI'm weighing whether to sell the Gift Card for a potential purchase of a standard pack or Even Steven. The Gift Card adds a +10 multiplier that contributes to scoring, yet with it, I could still reach high scores thanks to multipliers. \n\nThe risk is that selling the Gift Card could diminish my scoring ability. With our current deck composition and maybe a new powerful card from the pack, it might be beneficial, but I'd rather keep the Gift Card for its increasing value. So, I'll choose to buy nothing now and move to the round select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
