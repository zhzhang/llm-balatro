{"reasoning":"**Considering shop options**\n\nI'm analyzing some shop options: Smiley triggers on a score from face cards, and retriggers rescore, giving a +5 each time, which is good. The shop has various offers, like Satellite for money scaling, Chaos the Clown for a free reroll, Reserved Parking, and The Lovers as a wild card. Since this is the final shop, money isn't as relevant unless it's for rerolls. I could sell a weaker joker like Smiley to buy Chaos, which might be beneficial.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about the impact of Smiley, which is a significant additive for scoring and retriggers, likely contributing a lot. I have Sock and Chad as retriggers and Photograph gives a x2 bonus. Pareidolia ensures all cards face up, but removing it might limit triggering to just actual face cards, though my five-card flush usually has some non-face cards. The Lovers consumable in the shop costs $3 and can be a wild card, making flush consistency easier. However, I'd need to clear a slot first, possibly by using or selling one of my current consumables.\n**Strategizing for the boss round**\n\nI’m considering using Magician during the boss round to create Lucky cards for a big multiplier and Chariot to keep my steel card for a x1.5 boost. The Lovers might be less crucial, but what if I swapped Chariot for Lovers? The steel card gives a x1.5 multiplier while held, and I can keep it in hand while playing a five-card flush. I need to remember I can hold extra cards beyond the five played. The Lovers could help with flush consistency, especially if there’s a suit debuff in the final boss fight.\n**Assessing strategy against bosses**\n\nI'm facing challenging bosses like The Club that debuffs suits and \"The Ox,\" which sets money. Investing in a wild card can increase my chances of achieving a flush since it acts as any suit, possibly targeting clubs for synergy, even though I lack gluttonous cards. It’s tempting to buy the Tarot Merchant voucher for more tarot appearances, but since this is the final shop, it might be useless. Rerolling for strong jokers like Blueprint or Brainstorm with my $45 might be my best bet, even if it costs $8 per reroll. I need to optimize my scoring in this last opportunity.\n**Deciding on jokers and rerolls**\n\nI’m weighing my options for swapping jokers, but I worry that changing any might reduce my base scoring. Blueprint could copy Photograph or Chad, which might be huge! But I can only hold five cards, so I would need to sell one. Smiley might be the least valuable to replace since it boosts scores significantly. It adds +5 per scoring event, and with my current setup, I can achieve a lot of scoring events. \n\nInstead of focusing on buying Chaos, I might just reroll. Buying the Lovers could help with flush odds but isn’t critical. In the end, rerolling seems like the best option right now.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
