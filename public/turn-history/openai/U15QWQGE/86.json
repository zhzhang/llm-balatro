{"reasoning":"**Choosing the best card**\n\nI'm in STANDARD_PACK and need to select one card from a jumbo standard pack. I want to pick the best card to add to my deck, which currently includes Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Gift. My scoring strategy is focused on retriggering the first played card, so I'm looking for high chip bonuses or great retriggers. The options are 6♥, 2♥ foil (with +50 chips), 8♦, 2♦ gold, and 9♠ with retrigger capabilities. I need to consider synergy carefully since Smiley, Photograph, and Hanging Chad all interact in ways that could enhance performance.\n**Clarifying retrigger scoring**\n\nThe red seal retriggers a card once, and Hanging Chad can retrigger the first played card two additional times. So, the sequence goes like this: first scores, then the red seal retrigger happens, followed by Jokers retriggering from left to right. Hanging Chad, as a retriggering joker, comes after the red seal. This means the first played card might score 4 times: once for its base value, once for the red seal, and two additional times for Chad. Smiley adds a +5 multiplier, while Photograph gives a x2 multiplier but I need to verify if it triggers with each scoring.\n**Exploring card multipliers**\n\nThe first played face card gives a x2 multiplier when it's scored, and this likely triggers each time it's scored, even with retriggers. So the multiplier can become huge—like 2^4 = 16 with retriggers versus 2^3 = 8 without the red seal. Smiley also adds +5 each time. The idea of adding a red seal to ensure 9♠ is drawn often is appealing since it could be played as the first card. Although I prefer a flush build, with Pareidolia, any face card works. The 9♠ could potentially contribute to spade flushes, and the foil 2♥ offers +50 chips.\n**Evaluating chip and multiplier contributions**\n\nThe card adds a base of +2 chips plus +50, totaling +52 when scored. However, it only counts if it's part of a hand. In a flush, all five cards contribute their chips, which is great for boosting scores. The red seal on 9 offers repeated scoring, leading to more chips and multiplier triggers, so I could see it contributing 36 chips with retriggers. The foil 2 gives +52 once without retriggers. For huge scores, I need a mix of both chips and multipliers, as my base multiplier from a flush is 10.\n**Maximizing scoring potential**\n\nWith Chad, I get two extra retriggers, meaning the first card scores three times total. Smiley adds +5 each time, giving an extra +10 multiplier without retriggers. Photograph gives x2 for each scoring, so if it triggers multiple times, we could reach x8. That's significant! Adding the red seal boosts the multiplier to x16, making it a massive advantage. Therefore, selecting the 9 of Spades with retrigger is a smart choice. When I make my selection, I can use the command to choose from the pack!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
