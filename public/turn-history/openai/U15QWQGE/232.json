{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nEach played card seems to trigger extra time after scoring, which indeed means a retrigger would repeat the scoring sequence. This can multiply Ancient’s x1.5 for heart cards and Photograph's x2 for the first card whenever this occurs, which sounds powerful. I’m considering buying Seltzer, as it’s a Joker. However, I wonder if it duplicates functionality with Sock. It looks like Seltzer might be redundant since it essentially does what Sock already does in a different context.\n**Evaluating card interactions**\n\nSo, Sock triggers a retrigger for all played face cards. This means each face card can trigger again, and with Pareidolia, all cards count as face cards for a complete retrigger. Seltzer retriggers all played cards for the next 10 hands, which can stack if they overlap—great news! \n\nIf I need to sell something, maybe it could be Sock post-Seltzer purchase. Without Sock, Seltzer's retrigger is limited but valuable along with what Chad offers for additional first card support. Pareidolia remains important for managing interactions too; it enhances Photograph's functionality but might not be vital if I can ensure I’m playing a face card first.\n**Considering card strategy**\n\nAlright, we used Pareidolia to make all cards act as face cards for Sock’s retriggers and Smiley. Now with Seltzer, I wonder if we can swap either Sock or Pareidolia, since I can only sell one. Selling Sock seems like an option to make space for Seltzer while keeping Pareidolia for reliability with Photograph. \n\nI also note that Ancient Joker is focused on hearts, while Hanging Chad can synergize with Photograph due to its retrigger mechanics. Seltzer grants a global retrigger for 10 hands, which should be sufficient for a boss fight, but I have to weigh the indefinite retrigger Sock offers against this. Replacing Sock with Seltzer could turn out to be a neutral choice.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nSeltzer provides a retrigger for all cards like Sock but doesn’t require them to be face cards. However, if I sell Sock, I can’t stack, which could limit my strategy. If I keep Sock and buy Seltzer by selling something else, I'd benefit from two retriggers for all cards, which would be significant.\n\nI’m hesitant to sell Pareidolia because losing it could reduce the effectiveness of Sock, which relies on having face cards for triggers. Hanging Chad is also powerful due to its support for first played cards, which I might want to keep. Selling Photograph seems risky too, as it doubles scoring for face cards. So, I need to choose wisely!\n**Analyzing card benefits**\n\nAncient provides a significant multiplier for hearts, but the suit changes after each round. Since we haven't played yet, it’s likely hearts for now, which is good for boss battles. Meanwhile, Sock offers a retrigger for all face cards, whereas Seltzer retriggers all cards. \n\nI’m wondering whether to sell Sock or Pareidolia for Seltzer. If I keep Sock, I still benefit from face card retriggers, ensuring Photograph triggers successfully. Keeping Pareidolia boosts reliability, but if I lean towards Seltzer, I might prioritize Sock’s global retrigger system. I consider selling Hanging Chad instead, as it also adds to our strategy, but deciding between these cards requires careful thought on scoring contributions and how to maximize efficiency in the next game.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI’m considering selling Chad instead of Sock to maintain a strong setup with Pareidolia, Photograph, Sock, Ancient, and Seltzer. This gives me multiple triggers for all cards, with a base multiplier of 3503, which is a significant improvement over a previous total of 2076. Though selling Chad means losing a powerful retrigger for the first card, the benefit from Seltzer might outweigh that.\n\nI also want to keep an eye on my jokers and how they'll contribute during the boss battle. I could strategically buy Seltzer and Chaos, using my current funds wisely, while ensuring I stay within the joker limit. It’s a tangled web of options, but prioritizing Seltzer seems essential for maximizing my potential in the gameplay!\n**Evaluating joker strategy**\n\nI'm weighing whether to sell Chad to make room for Chaos and potentially add Seltzer. The idea would be to use Chaos for a free reroll and then sell it afterward. That way, I could possibly find a better joker. \n\nWhile considering my current jokers, I realize that I want to keep Pareidolia, Photograph, and Sock since they offer essential triggers. If I sell Chad, I can buy Seltzer, which would allow for more versatile triggers. Overall, it seems like buying Seltzer by selling Chad is the best move for maximizing my efficiency heading into the boss fight!\n**Considering joker strategies**\n\nI'm analyzing the retriggering capabilities of Sock and Seltzer. Seltzer acts as a Joker and has a significant retrigger effect for the next 10 hands, which feels like a global retrigger. I realize the order of play might matter for efficient scoring, but maybe not as much as I initially thought. \n\nMy next step is to sell Hanging Chad to make room for Seltzer. I’ll have to execute that action first because I can only handle one command at a time. Let's finalize it: selling Joker in position 3!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
