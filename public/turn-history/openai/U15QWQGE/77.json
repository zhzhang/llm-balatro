{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI'm looking into how the Hanging Chad card works. It retriggers when the first played card is scored, but it seems the retrigger effects occur after the initial scoring triggers. So, I need to consider the order, especially between Photograph and Chad. The sequence for scoring involves base chips, card modifiers, 'On scored' Jokers, and then retriggers. It seems like the order impacts the retrigger stage, but initial triggers might not be affected. I'm also noting various independent jokers and their effects.\n**Examining joker interactions**\n\nI'm analyzing how independent jokers work, especially how they impact multiplicative and additive values. In Balatro, the order really matters—additive multipliers should come first to maximize final scores. For example, if I start with a hand value of 10, adding +10 before applying a multiplier like x3 gives a better result than the reverse. Gift Card should come before Acrobat to optimize scoring. However, chips added by jokers seem to operate independently, so their order isn’t as significant. I need to keep all these mechanics in mind!\n**Rearranging jokers strategically**\n\nTo optimize the order of jokers, it seems like placing Photograph first, then Hanging Chad, followed by Stuntman, then Gift Card, and finally Acrobat is the best strategy. Having Gift before Acrobat makes sense, as independent triggers should go from left to right. I’m considering potential consumables too, but Wraith is not useful right now since it sets money to zero. Justice can enhance a card, but I can’t use it in the shop. My best action seems to be to proceed with round selection or reroll the shop for better options.\n**Weighing midgame options**\n\nIn the middle of the game, I'm considering whether to look for a scaling joker like Sock and Buskin. However, with only $7, saving for interest seems smarter, as I’d earn $1 for every $5 at the end of the round. If I reroll now, I’d lose potential interest by dropping down to $2. Plus, there are no boosters or vouchers available. It seems best to proceed with round selection to earn more money and interest before shopping. Let's go ahead with that!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
