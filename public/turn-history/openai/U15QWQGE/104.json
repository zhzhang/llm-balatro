{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game options**\n\nI'm currently in a shop with $3, but the options cost $4 or more, except for a reroll which also costs $3. I can't afford anything right now, so saving seems wise to avoid going negative. If I reroll, all my money would be gone, and I might get a cheap planet card, but I'd still be stuck with $0. I think it's better to proceed to the next blind while preserving my $3 for potential interest and future opportunities. Before leaving, I might want to rearrange some jokers for scoring too.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m trying to figure out the interactions between the Photograph and Ancient cards and the Hanging Chad joker in scoring. The Hanging Chad appears to be a retriggering joker that activates after the first round of scoring. I think the order of these cards matters, especially since my first played card is linked to Photograph, which doubles its value if it's a face card. Meanwhile, Ancient provides a multiplier if it's a heart. Overall, I need to ensure the right sequence to maximize my score!\n**Evaluating scoring strategies**\n\nI realize that multiplying values in different orders doesn’t change the final outcome, like x2 then x1.5 equals x3. However, the Hanging Chad joker allows for retriggering, which creates extra scoring events. So, the order of the scores doesn’t seem to matter much, although the combination of multipliers might. I’m considering selling something like Pareidolia to buy either Mystic Summit or Shoot the Moon. I need to decide which option is the best investment for maximizing my score!\n**Examining card synergy**\n\nOur strategy includes ensuring that Pareidolia works with Photograph to guarantee that it triggers, especially if I'm playing pairs or two pairs. With Pareidolia, all cards count as face cards, so Photograph always activates and gives a x2 multiplier. I want to prioritize the highest chip card first to maximize this synergy, especially with the Hanging Chad retrigger. Meanwhile, the Gift Card boosts sell values and offers scaling, while the Ancient Joker can provide solid multipliers depending on suit. Finally, the Clever Joker offers significant rewards if I hold a Two Pair.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI’m evaluating whether to keep or sell Ancient, considering its multipliers for suit matches. Selling it could give me $6, boosting my funds to $9, allowing me to buy either Mystic Summit or Clever. Mystic Summit offers a great +15 multiplier, especially if I manage discards effectively. However, losing Ancient might reduce my overall scalability since it supports high multipliers for suited cards. Yet, with the upcoming ante5 and increasing thresholds, I may need the Mystic Summit’s scaling potential. \n\nFor now, I could sell Ancient and invest in Mystic Summit, focusing on maximizing my scoring potential and planning for discards.\n**Reviewing card strategies and options**\n\nI’m thinking through my discard actions, where each allows me to discard up to 5 cards and costs one discard. I could use my four discards early to gain multipliers for future hands. Clever Joker offers a solid +80 chips for two pairs, but I wonder if focusing on flushes or straights would be better. Selling Ancient for $6 would let me buy Mystic Summit and potentially a booster pack, maximizing my scoring potential. Mystic Summit requires no discards, which I can manage, so selling Ancient seems wise. Buying a booster pack would also enhance my game!\n**Deciding on joker strategies**\n\nI’m analyzing whether to sell Ancient. While it offers a strong multiplier, buying Mystic Summit could balance things out. I could also sell Pareidolia for $4, keeping my configurations while still accessing Mystic Summit. However, not having Pareidolia means Photograph may trigger only on face cards, which complicates flush strategies. I’d rather keep Chad for retriggers, so perhaps selling Ancient for Mystic Summit makes sense. Then I could look at a booster pack next. My first action would be to sell Ancient.\n**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI’m evaluating whether to sell Ancient to buy Mystic Summit. After selling Ancient, I’d have $9 and could buy Mystic for $5. While Ancient provides multiplier benefits, Mystic gives a consistent +15 multiplier. However, Ancient might be more powerful if I can play hearts effectively, adding multiplicative scaling. Mystic is reliable but requires zero discards, which helps with scaling. Ultimately, I might keep Ancient and consider selling Pareidolia instead, but that could jeopardize my current multipliers. Deciding what to prioritize is tricky!\n**Considering strategic options**\n\nIt seems that selling Ancient might be a good way to buy Mystic and improve reliability. However, I’m weighing whether to keep Ancient. If I trade it for Mystic and a booster, I could gain stability, but Ancient has multipliers that can be powerful. The issue is I can't afford any enhancements with only $3, which limits my options. Selling Pareidolia or Gift Card seems risky due to their advantages, so maybe the best decision right now is to hold steady and focus on the next round. Let's opt for a round select.\n**Finalizing next action**\n\nIt looks like the best move right now is to go with `round_select`, since I don't have enough money to buy anything useful and selling items might not be worth it. Mystic Summit could be an upgrade, but keeping Ancient seems far more beneficial based on my calculations, especially for flush hands. The ability to keep my current setup with triggers from Photograph and Chad is essential. So I’ll focus on selecting the next round and sticking with my current deck composition.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
