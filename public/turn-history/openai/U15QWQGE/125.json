{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker choices**\n\nIn the buffoon pack, I need to choose one joker from two options, but since we have a maximum of five jokers, I'd need to sell one before I can add another. In Balatro, if there's no room in the pack, I can't take a new joker without selling first. My options are Mystic Summit, which gives a +15 multiplier when there are zero discards, and Riff-raff, which creates two common jokers. I need to decide which one to prioritize.\n**Analyzing joker selections**\n\nI find that to select jokers blindly, I need at least two empty slots, which isn’t feasible since I can only hold five jokers. Selling two before selecting each time feels cumbersome. While I could sell any generated jokers immediately after creation, that still requires keeping slots open, which isn’t ideal. Mystic Summit looks like the better option—it provides a +15 multiplier under certain conditions and may even replace Gift Card, which gives a +10 multiplier and boosts sell value.\n**Deciding on joker replacements**\n\nI’m considering whether to replace Gift with Swash, but we didn’t actually buy Swash. Mystic Summit boosts our multiplier more than Gift (+5), but we lose the sell value scaling of Gift. Since scoring is more important at ante 6, Ancient Joker’s x1.5 for each suited card is significant, along with Photograph’s x2 for the first face card and Hanging Chad’s retriggering ability. I feel that we should replace Gift Card since it seems the least impactful compared to the other options.\n**Evaluating Gift vs. Mystic Summit**\n\nGift offers a holographic edition that provides a +10 multiplier and adds to sell value each round, totaling a +10 multiplier already factored in. Mystic Summit, however, gives a +15 multiplier when there are zero discards, which seems better overall. If we achieve a flush, the base multiplier is 10, plus Gift's +10 would bring it to 20. With Photograph and Pareidolia, the first scored face card gets multiplied by 2, leading to significant scoring from retriggers—essentially multiplying the score by 8 across three total scores.\n**Weighing joker options**\n\nI’m reevaluating whether to stick with our current jokers or consider Riff-raff and Mystic Summit. Riff-raff could create two commons, but I’d need to sell jokers for room, and sacrificing synergy by doing so might not be worth it. Mystic Summit seems better, giving a solid +15 multiplier. If I sell Gift and buy Summit, I could use the remaining money to grab Swashbuckler. Swash would add a significant +40 multiplier, making it an attractive option, especially if combined with Gift's +10. But I'd lose the impact of Pareidolia on face cards, which complicates things.\n**Considering joker strategies**\n\nIn a flush, a face card must match the suit, and if using Ancient Joker, I’d need a face card from that suit for Photo. With Pareidolia, any card works, which is huge. Ancient Joker offers bonuses for suited cards, but it’s not essential. Pareidolia ensures that Photo triggers since the first played card is always face. I'm leaning towards keeping Pareidolia because it aids synergies. Selling Gift for Mystic Summit looks tempting, but the +15 multiplier isn’t much better than Gift’s +10. I plan to sell Gift, target Mystic Summit, and then return to the shop for more options and cash.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
