{"reasoning":"**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI need to determine how to select cards during the boss phase, where I'll discard two random cards for each hand played. I also need 22,000 chips for this. We have a strong joker set that includes two Photographs, which double the value of the first played face card. The Hanging Chad feature allows for the first card to score multiple times, increasing our points. I want the first scoring card to be a club to maximize multipliers.\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m realizing that the retrigger does repeat the scoring sequence for the cards, including scored jokers. The Photograph card is a joker that activates when the first face card is scored, offering a x2 multiplier. So, if that face card retriggers, it seems the Photograph could trigger again as it's still considered the first played face card. With the Hanging Chad giving two additional retriggers, that multiplies the Photograph's value to x8. It all seems to add up!\n**Selecting the best hand**\n\nThe Ancient Joker boosts scores by x1.5 for each club card, meaning that if I score a club first, I get a significant multiplier of 3.375. It's crucial to ensure that the first scoring card is a club. Currently, my hand includes an Ace of Spades, two Jacks, and several other cards. I could create a Pair of Jacks, but my joker multipliers could make them valuable. Alternatively, I could go for Two Pair with Jacks and Tens. I think JH, JC, 10S, 10C, and 9C could work!\n**Deciding on hand strategy**\n\nWith base chips at a 40 multiplier, I'm seeing some potential here. However, it seems I can't form three of a kind or a straight. I considered a flush but I don't have enough. I think my best option is to go for Two Pair using Tens and Jacks, ensuring I play a club card first. In this system, I can organize the play order, so I might use the rearrange_hand feature to position my scoring card first. Dragging to rearrange also seems like a solid option!\n**Calculating hand scoring**\n\nI can set the order using rearrange_hand, and I believe the cards are played in the specified selection order. I'm considering playing a club card first, possibly the Jack or Ten of Clubs, to score for Two Pair. The Ancient Joker gives a x1.5 multiplier for each club that's played, plus the Photograph gives x2 on the first face card scored. It looks like I can maximize my score by ensuring I play a club as my first card to optimize those multipliers! \n\nFor scoring, I estimate that my Two Pair hand will provide a base of 40 chips, and with the multipliers applied, it could significantly increase my total. After calculating through the multipliers, I can get around 526.5 as my final multiplier, which should boost my chips quite nicely!\n**Calculating total chips and scoring**\n\nI figured that the first card retrigger adds chips each time it scores. So, the Jack of Clubs will effectively contribute chips three times, totaling 30 from that one card. Adding other cards gives me a total of 100 chips (40 base + 60 from additional scoring). When multiplied by 526.5, I end up with about 52,650 chips, easily over the 22k target!\n\nTo optimize, I need to ensure my first scored card is the Jack of Clubs. I’ll use the rearrange_hand command to position it first and then play my cards. Even if the order isn’t perfect, I'm still likely to achieve my goal!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [5,4,6,2,7]"}
