{"reasoning":"**Deciding on jokers' strategy**\n\nI'm currently in a shop with five jokers and several options like Supernova 5 and Walkie Talkie 4. I have 7 money and need to decide on my next move. I already have a solid combo with Photograph and Hanging Chad. I need to rearrange the jokers for optimal scoring and retriggering. I realize the order matters since Photograph triggers off the first face card played—so I'm weighing how to best organize them for maximum effect.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm thinking about the scoring mechanics here. When I play a face card for the first time, it gives me a x2 multiplier. For retriggers, the same face card will still score x2 each time. So that could mean multiple x2s! Now, I need to figure out the order between Photograph and other jokers. The Gift Card is independent and adds a +10 multiplier after scoring, but I'm not sure how that interacts with Photograph's x2 multiplier. It seems like the timing of when these multipliers apply matters. Am I right about that?\n**Exploring multiplier mechanics**\n\nIn Balatro, the x multiplier effects typically apply at the moment they're used. If I apply a +10 later, it won’t factor into earlier multiplications. So, I should probably focus on using +mult effects earlier with on-scored or held jokers. The Gift Card is independent and I can rearrange it among other independent jokers. I need to think about the order of Photograph and Hanging Chad — it seems crucial that Photograph stays left of the others to maximize triggers. It's all very strategic!\n**Reassessing card order and purchases**\n\nI'm planning to put Photograph first and Hanging Chad second among scoring-related cards, but I realize that the order between them may not matter since their triggering categories are different. However, keeping Photograph to the left of Chad feels safer. Now, regarding purchases: the Supernova increases multipliers based on how many times each poker hand has been played. Right now, we've played full house twice, three of a kind twice, and one straight, so it doesn't seem to boost things significantly, especially with the full house only adding two this round.\n**Evaluating purchases and jokers**\n\nI’m thinking about how the Supernova could potentially increase my multipliers since it counts the number of poker hands played. If I buy it for $5, I’ll only have $2 left, which isn’t great for interest. I could sell the Trading Card, but that might limit my options. Plus, I need to optimize the order of my jokers. It's clear I want Photograph to trigger before any multipliers for maximum effect. But should I just go for a round_select or reroll the shop instead? Decisions, decisions!\n**Considering joker and purchase strategy**\n\nI’m weighing the option of getting an on-scored multiplier joker like Lusty, but since I sold Lusty already, should I go for Supernova next? I realize that having x multipliers at the end might actually reduce the overall effect. Photograph triggers multiple times, so it boosts both the base and on-scored multipliers. It’s tempting to rearrange the jokers, putting the Gift Card first, but it’s still additive. I think I’ll just proceed with round_select for now since I’m focusing on saving money for future rounds.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
