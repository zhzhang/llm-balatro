{"reasoning":"**Reviewing game strategy**\n\nI’m trying to make sense of my decisions in the game. We’re back in the shop after previously selecting cards, and I need to remember we have $12 and some options like the 8 Ball and The Star tarot. There’s also a booster pack available. I need to strategize for the Ante 6 big/boss challenge, focusing on how my cards work together for maximum synergy, especially how Photograph works with scoring multipliers. This seems crucial!\n**Strategizing scoring moves**\n\nI’m realizing that my first scoring card is crucial, especially since I want to maximize the Bloodstone multiplier. Ideally, I'd want a glass and heart to trigger the bonus. I have a wild card, the Lovers, which can act as hearts, but I can’t see my hand right now since I’m in the shop. That makes using consumables tricky. I’m considering buying The Star, which can convert cards to Diamonds, but I'm unsure if that’s the right move. The Standard Pack might help, but I need to weigh my options carefully!\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m considering our current situation. With high multipliers in play, chips aren’t as necessary, but they still help. We’re at the joker cap, so I need to decide which one to sell. Card Sharp is strong since it gives a x3 multiplier with repeated hands, while Bloodstone randomly boosts scores from hearts. I think it’s smart to keep our solid core of cards and maybe focus on getting the Standard Pack, which could help us find more hearts or other enhancements for our deck. At $4, it seems like a good investment!\n**Considering shop options**\n\nI’m thinking about whether to reroll the shop for a better joker or maybe a planet. The cost is $3, and since we have $12, I could reroll a couple of times. With my current joker cap, I'm really looking for powerful cards like Blueprint or Brainstorm. Since we’re heading to the Ante 6 boss, that might be crucial. The Star is available for $3, but it needs targets to use effectively. I’m weighing if converting cards to diamonds might help with my strategy, but I still need to focus on those first card triggers!\n**Deciding on next move**\n\nI’m realizing that aiming for a flush might decrease my reliability in this game. So, it’s probably better to skip that idea. I think the best next step is to buy a Standard Pack booster. That could give me a strong enhanced card like glass or steel, or maybe a high-ranking heart to be my first scorer. Yep, that sounds like the plan! I’m going to go ahead and do that.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
