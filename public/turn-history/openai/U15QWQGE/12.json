{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nI’m considering how gifts and multipliers work in the game. If gifts add to the multiplier, and chips are added as well, the multiplication occurs at the end: total chips multiplied by total multipliers. \n\nThe order of operations doesn’t matter here because adding chips doesn’t affect the multiplier at the moment. I need to keep track of both chips and multipliers, while knowing that the final outcome will depend on multiplying them together at the end. So, let’s move on to round selection.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
