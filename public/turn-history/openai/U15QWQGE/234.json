{"reasoning":"**Assessing game strategy**\n\nI’m at the shop before facing the final boss, and I'm piecing together the round structure. Each blind represents a round, so it seems like round 16 is the big blind. I’m considering my options here: Chaos the Clown, Matador, and Pluto. I have enough jokers for buying, but I wonder if it's worth selling my current cards, which have a solid synergy. The Tarot Merchant doesn’t seem useful either since the game ends after this boss.\n**Considering shop options**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to reroll the shop for a better joker, but I'm limited on money. If I do reroll, I might find something like Blueprint, though I'd have to sell some items to make room. However, I’m realizing it might be more effective to rearrange the order of my jokers for optimal triggers. I need to ensure that Photograph triggers on the first face card, while Ancient activates on heart cards. The order of playback matters, and I think Pareidolia's passive nature makes its placement flexible.\n**Analyzing card scoring**\n\nI'm breaking down how card scoring works: I score base chips first, then enhancements, editions, and finally apply \"on-scored\" Jokers from left to right. For the first played card, Photograph doubles the score, and Ancient adds 1.5x if the suit matches. I don't think the order matters unless there's an additive element. For retriggers, Sock and Seltzer add or retrigger all played cards, and I need to consider their placement. Since there’s no better purchase in the shop, I should just head to the boss with my current setup, but I can't use consumables since I have no cards.\n**Planning for the boss round**\n\nI need to focus on using Magician and Chariot during the round to enhance my cards. My plan is to have Magician enhance two key scoring cards, ideally hearts, but I need to remember that Ancient's suit can change at the end of the round. Since I played a flush last round and the Ancient suit switched then, I’m not sure what the current suit is. The description implies it’s still hearts, so I’ll assume that. Now, it's time to select the round without rerolling the boss.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
