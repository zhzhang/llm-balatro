{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop actions**\n\nI need to decide what to do regarding my shopping options. I can't afford the Saturn or Egg items since they're too expensive. The Joker with a +4 multiplier is affordable, but I already have five. I think selling something could help me buy. I could sell the Smiley Face for $2, but it offers a +5 multiplier compared to the Joker, which is a better deal. So, maybe I should save the $2 for interest instead. Selling something might let me get a spectral pack for better options.\n**Considering selling options**\n\nI’m thinking about selling a Joker to free up space and gain some funds. If I sell the Smiley Face for $2, I’d have $4 to buy a spectral pack right away. I wonder if that’s better than keeping the Smiley. It’s strong synergy, but I could potentially get valuable cards from the spectral pack, like \"Soul\" or \"Sigil.\" \n\nOn the flip side, selling the Bloodstone for $3 would give me $5, allowing me to buy the pack and still have a dollar left. Bloodstone has strong synergy too, especially with hearts, but then I think about the risk and reward of these options!\n**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nI’m considering whether to sell Bloodstone or Pareidolia, but maybe I shouldn’t. We have a consumable Magician that I can use in the shop. However, I’m realizing it might only target cards in my deck, not a hand since none are displayed in the shop. So, I can’t use the Magician here. Thus, my best move is to proceed to round selection. Buying the Joker for a +4 multiplier or rerolling the shop isn’t feasible, so I'll just continue with the round selection.\n**Rearranging jokers for optimization**\n\nI need to think about rearranging my jokers to maximize their triggers. The order in which they're played matters because the scoring goes left to right. I have several jokers: Pareidolia, Photograph, Bloodstone, Hanging Chad, and Smiley Face. \n\nTo get the most out of their multipliers, I should consider playing Smiley Face before Photograph since Smiley adds a +5 multiplier when face cards score. I believe Photograph's x2 multiplier applies after Smiley’s bonus, so this way, we can effectively double the total multiplier. It seems like using them in this order could really boost my scores!\n**Rearranging jokers for scoring optimization**\n\nI’ve been thinking about the order of my jokers to maximize their effectiveness during scoring. It seems I should place Smiley Face before Photograph to get the additive +5 multiplier first. \n\nSince Bloodstone provides a x1.5 multiplier when hearts score, I want to ensure it triggers before Photograph, which gives a x2 multiplier only on the first face card. \n\nIn the current order, Smiley posts scoring the others, so I’ll rearrange the jokers to: Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, Bloodstone, and Hanging Chad. This way, I can maximize multipliers effectively! After rearrangement, I’ll proceed to round selection.\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,5,2,3,4]"}
