{"reasoning":"**Selecting a card**\n\nI'm currently working with a standard pack and have the 3 of Diamonds, 6 of Clubs, and 3 of Clubs. I need to choose one card to add to my deck. Since we’re looking for the highest chip bonus, I see that the 6 of Clubs gives me +6 chips, while the 3s only give +3 chips. So, it makes sense to go with the 6 of Clubs. My decision is to select 2 actions.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
