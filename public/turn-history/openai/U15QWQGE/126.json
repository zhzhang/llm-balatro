{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nI need to think about the order of jokers triggering from left to right. Mystic Summit and Photograph are involved here. Specifically, Photograph seems to activate when the first face card is scored. It looks like Ancient cards offer a x1.5 multiplier when scored, while Mystic Summit gives a +15 multiplier when there are no discards left. I realize that the independent joker is additive after scoring, which seems good but occurs later in the process. Another option might be the Swashbuckler from the shop that we haven’t explored yet.\n**Considering joker purchases**\n\nWith $52, I can buy Swash for $4, but I’d need to make room. After picking Mystic, I have 5 jokers, so I wonder if I should keep a slot open for Swash instead. Leaving that slot might be better than filling it with Mystic. Swash enhances the sell value of other jokers, and I should recall our current sell values: Photo at 10, Chad at 9, Parei at 6, and Ancient at 8. If I keep my current four jokers, the total sell value would be 33, which is much greater than Swash's +15 multiplier.\n**Deciding on joker choices**\n\nIf I pick Mystic now, I can sell it later for Swash. But if I choose Riff-raff, I might not get as much value. I think Swash will still be available after returning, since the shop persists. After the pack, I should still see Swash in the shop. The best strategy might be to choose Mystic Summit now and decide about Swash later. I could even keep both, but I’d have to drop another joker. Maybe Ancient since its suit might limit options? Yet Ancient offers a strong multiplier, especially with suited cards.\n**Choosing between jokers**\n\nI’m weighing the advantages of Swash, which offers a consistent +33, against Mystic's +15, which is conditional. However, I could choose Mystic now and decide later about buying Swash and selling Mystic. If I skip the pack, I won't have that option later, so it seems wiser to take Mystic first. I just need to confirm my command and select 1. Let's go ahead and make that choice!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
