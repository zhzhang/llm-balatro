{"reasoning":"**Considering card selling strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about selling cards, perhaps pricing one at $1 to generate funds, but that won't be enough for any joker since they cost at least $4. Combining the sale of the Blue Joker ($2) or Bloodstone ($3) could help me buy Odd Todd or Gros Michel. My current strategy involves a strong face-card set. I wonder if I should sacrifice synergy by selling Pareidolia or stick with my plan for a flush strategy. It's a tough call!\n**Analyzing card value and strategy**\n\nI've realized that \"Hit the Road\" scales with discarded Jacks, and while Pareidolia makes all face cards, it doesn't change their ranks. If I sell the Blue Joker and Magician for $3, I'm still short for Odd Todd at $4. However, selling Bloodstone instead would get me the funds I need. Bloodstone's power for a heart flush seems too valuable to lose. I might consider selling the Blue Joker and another low-value card to purchase Gros Michel instead. It's a tricky decision!\n**Examining card selling and scoring strategies**\n\nI'm considering selling the Blue Joker and Magician, or maybe even Bloodstone, but I'd prefer to keep Bloodstone. If I sell the two jokers, I could afford Odd Todd, which is tempting, but the shop's closing soon. The order of jokers really impacts scoring — it seems the Photograph should come before Bloodstone to maximize its benefits. Bloodstone offers a nice multiplier for heart cards, so I want to be strategic about placing my cards for optimal scoring. This is getting a bit complex!\n**Organizing scoring order for cards**\n\nI'm considering the order of my cards during scoring. If I place the Photograph before the Bloodstone, it gives a x2 multiplier on the first card scored, while Bloodstone provides a x1.5. The retriggers from Hanging Chad will repeat the scoring of the first card, so I think the ideal sequence might be Photograph, Bloodstone, then the others, finishing with Hanging Chad. Since Chad is a retriggering joker, its placement might depend on when the retriggers occur, even though it’s not part of the initial scoring. It’s complex!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
