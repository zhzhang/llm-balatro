{"reasoning":"**Analyzing money strategy**\n\nI have $2 left, but my build is strong after scoring big with a flush. Now, ante 7 requires 52,500, and I might clear that with one solid flush. The boss only needs one hand type, so sticking to flush seems easiest. I’m considering shopping before ante 8. If I skip the big round, I miss a $4 reward and shop for upgrades, which could be helpful. Playing big seems like the better strategy.\n**Maximizing score multipliers**\n\nI need to ensure the boss's hand is a flush. My jokers are strong, especially with Pareidolia, as it boosts all face cards with a multiplier. Photograph gives a x2 bonus on the first played face card, while Hanging Chad retriggers the scoring card twice. Bloodstone adds a x1.5 boost for hearts. I want my first scored card to be a heart to maximize trigger chances, creating multiple opportunities for scoring through all these boosts. That could lead to a huge score!\n**Preparing for a heart card**\n\nI need a solid heart card, and I might use Aura to enhance the King of Spades. We're targeting the King and two hearts, but the results are uncertain. Aura can add a Foil, Holo, or Polychrome effect to one selected card, so I'll choose option 1 for Aura and apply it to the 2 of Hearts. This gives it a random edition, which is helpful, especially since it’ll be the first card played, potentially triggering multipliers. I should play big to earn shop money!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
