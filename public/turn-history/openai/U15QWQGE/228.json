{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI think I'm close to the final shop before the last boss, which might be at Ante 8, round 16. Since there are three blinds per ante, it seems like the boss should be in round 17. However, metadata suggests the current game state indicates Ante 8, round 16 as the final step. I need to focus on maximizing my score for the boss fight instead of just accumulating money. The shop has some interesting items that can help!\n**Analyzing strategy with items**\n\nI'm thinking about whether Turtle Bean could help by increasing hand size, allowing me to keep more cards, including the steel card from Chariot. The steel card provides a x1.5 multiplier while held, which is significant. If my hand size increases from the default of 8 to 13, that would be huge! With only one round left, Turtle Bean's effects will apply, letting me hold the steel card while selecting for a flush. Plus, I have the Magician, who can create two Lucky cards, which offer a chance for a +20 multiplier!\n**Weighing options for upgrades**\n\nI’m considering whether keeping the steel card with a larger hand size is worth it, even if I need to give up a joker slot to buy Turtle Bean. Turtle Bean costs $6, and we’re already at full capacity, so I’d have to sell something. Pareidolia is a strong contender since it makes all cards face cards, boosting Smiley and Sock's effects. The synergy among these cards is powerful! However, I wonder if Smiley is less valuable compared to Turtle Bean.\n**Calculating scoring potential**\n\nSmiley really boosts the multiplier for every scoring card. If I score with a flush of 5 cards, each one could retrigger, adding up to significant points. Sock gives an extra score for each played card, while Chad can retrigger the first card twice. I think that means the first card can score four times: once for itself, plus Sock’s one and Chad’s two. The other cards would score twice each. Totaling it all, I could end up with 12 scoring events! That’s a hefty +60 multiplier from Smiley!\n**Optimizing card strategy**\n\nI’m evaluating the impact of my jokers and their triggering potential. If Smiley adds a +5 multiplier per scoring event and interacts well with retriggers from Sock and Chad, the scoring becomes massive! I’m considering swapping out jokers like Smiley or Sock for Turtle Bean, but it seems Turtle Bean may not be necessary. Especially if bosses could reduce hand size, I pattern my strategy around keeping as many triggers as possible. Ultimately, I think keeping the current joker setup and optimizing the order of triggers is key to maximizing my scoring events!\n**Deciding on rerolls and strategy**\n\nI'm weighing whether to place Photograph before Smiley or keep the current setup. I think keeping Smiley first is better because it adds to the multiplier before being multiplied further. Since multiple triggers increase the final multiplier significantly, this order seems optimal. I’m also considering rerolling for stronger jokers, even though each reroll costs $9. We might find something like Blueprint or Brainstorm, which could greatly enhance my strategy. I should probably reroll while keeping some reserve cash for future purchases. I’ll go ahead and try one more reroll!\n**Considering the next boss strategy**\n\nI've identified the next boss as The Needle, which means I'll need to focus on maximizing a single hand because it allows only one. To do that efficiently, enhancing our strategy with the Steel card is essential, especially if I want to play a flush with five cards. Turtle Bean would let me hold more Steel cards, but I'd only need one. It looks like rerolling is the best bet, aiming for powerful jokers like Blueprint or Brainstorm. So, I’ll go ahead and reroll in the shop!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
