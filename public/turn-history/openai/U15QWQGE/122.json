{"reasoning":"**Evaluating planet pack choices**\n\nI'm considering the planet pack options and trying to decide which one to pick. Venus looks like the best choice since it enhances three of a kind, which is crucial for scoring big. It gives a +2 multiplier and increases chip counts, helping our scores significantly since we often hit three of a kinds or full houses. Plus, our best score came from three of a kind, so upgrading that seems wise. I'll choose card position 3 for Venus.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
