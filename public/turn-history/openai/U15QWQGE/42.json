{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card interactions**\n\nWhen the face card is scored initially, the Photo trigger activates. It's unclear if it retriggers under certain conditions, but it seems it might trigger again for scoring. In Balatro, I think it does trigger each time because it’s still the first face card, leading to a strong multiplier effect – potentially x8 if scored three times. The Lusty Joker adds a +3 multiplier each time a heart card is retriggered. Overall, these combinations seem to create great synergy, especially with the Glass card.\n**Evaluating hand multipliers**\n\nSupernova adjusts the multiplier based on how many times a poker hand has been played during a run. It’s tied to the specific chosen hand but adds counts whenever scoring hands of that type. Right now, my counts are small, with a Full House and Three of a Kind each played twice. If I focus on one hand, it’ll grow. Hanging Chad seems to be the best option at the moment, while I might consider selling the Mail-In Rebate joker to free up space.\n**Assessing card strategies**\n\nThe Photograph’s x2 multiplier is significant, so I want to keep that. I’m considering selling either the Trading Card or the Mail-In Rebate since we have $8, which will increase after selling. Passing blinds and managing the economy are important too. The Hanging Chad offers great multiplier scaling, which is tempting as a replacement. The Trading Card provides +$3 per round with a single discard, while the Mail-In offers $5 per discarded specific rank and adds +50 chips. Keeping the Mail-In might be beneficial overall.\n**Deciding on card replacements**\n\nThe Photograph trigger is significant as it activates once per hand with a face card, leading to a huge x2 multiplier that can be further boosted with Hanging Chad. I think I should definitely keep the Photograph. It might make sense to replace the Lusty Joker with Chad because their combination seems more reliable and strong. However, while hearts can retrigger, they may not always be available, making them less dependable. Selling the Lusty Joker for $3 and purchasing Hanging Chad for $4 could work well, costing just $1 in the end. I also need to consider the positioning for triggering effects.\n**Analyzing joker order and actions**\n\nThe Photograph card gives a x2 multiplier when the first face card scores, which means the order of jokers plays a role. If Photograph comes before Lusty, that matters for how they trigger. But regardless, the order for x multipliers doesn’t affect their effectiveness. Additive multipliers like the Gift Card should come before x multipliers, and Lusty gives a +3 on scoring. I’m thinking it’s best to sell the Lusty Joker for space and consider buying Hanging Chad later. Given my current setup, I’ve decided to sell the Lusty Joker.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
