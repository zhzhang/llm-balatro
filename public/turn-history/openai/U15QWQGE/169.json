{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot choices**\n\nI’m looking at the tarot options. The Star lets me convert up to three cards to Diamonds, while the Magician can enhance two to Lucky cards. The Fool creates another Magician card, but it only produces the last used card, which is interesting. I need to decide between the Fool and the Magician, keeping in mind the strategy for hearts flush and the Bloodstone. More Lucky cards seem beneficial, but I’m weighing my options carefully.\n**Analyzing scoring strategy**\n\nI’m working on the scoring system that uses first played face cards to trigger abilities like Photograph x2 and Hanging Chad for extra chances. If I score a Lucky heart first, it’ll retrigger, which is fantastic for boosting my score. I’m considering enhancing the King of Hearts, but I worry that making it Lucky might overwrite its current multiplier. It seems better to focus on cards without special enhancements, like the 6 of hearts, while aiming for hearts to synergize with my Bloodstone.\n**Considering heart strategy**\n\nI’m noticing there are more hearts in the deck, but my hand has only two. If I use the Fool to create a Magician, that might help me target other hearts, though I’m still limited by what's shown. It seems the Fool could potentially let me target any cards, but right now, it focuses on my current hand. Even if my hand doesn't strictly fit a hearts flush, making some cards lucky can help with Photograph and Pareidolia. It’s getting complicated, but I’m weighing my options carefully!\n**Exploring card enhancements**\n\nI’m considering enhancing non-heart cards, which could boost my overall multiplier. However, I might want to convert suits to hearts later using tarot. Right now, the Star only converts to diamonds, which isn’t helpful. So, I think the best option is to take the Magician or the Fool to add two Lucky cards. If I choose the Fool, it creates a Magician that can be used immediately, which might be the same effect as directly selecting the Magician. I need to clarify how consumable cards work in this context!\n**Clarifying the Fool's effects**\n\nIt seems I'm reading that \"The Fool excludes The Magician,\" which is confusing because the secondary description implies it can create a Magician. This might mean the Fool creates a consumable Magician card for later use. However, the booster suggests the card is used immediately. I think choosing the Fool could be strategic, as it may allow me to hold onto the Magician for better targets later. If the Fool creates a Magician and it doesn’t require immediate targeting, I’ll definitely choose that option!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
