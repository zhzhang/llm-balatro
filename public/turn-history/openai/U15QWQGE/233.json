{"reasoning":"**Considering purchase strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about the reroll cost of $11. A free reroll could be quite valuable, but Seltzer might be a higher priority than chaos. If I buy chaos first, I could use the free reroll in hopes of finding something big like Blueprint or Brainstorm, though the chances are slim. But if I fill my slot, I can't buy a new joker unless I sell something. I should probably secure Seltzer first before anything else to avoid losing my chance.\n**Deciding on boss fight strategy**\n\nFor this boss fight, I'm considering if I need 10 hands, but maybe even just 4 would suffice. I wonder if the boss might limit my options. Matador seems pretty useless unless the boss's blind ability activates, which is uncertain. Also, the Tarot Merchant voucher probably won't help before the final boss since there may not be any shops left afterward. It seems wise to skip that. My next action will be to buy Seltzer now for $15. I'll respond with \"buy_card\" positions [3].\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [3]"}
