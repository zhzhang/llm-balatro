{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m at the shop and need to make decisions about my purchases. I have $50 and 5 jokers, and the shop offers options like Saturn, Lovers, Swashbuckler, and Chaos, as well as packs like celestial and buffoon. I’m leaning toward buying Swashbuckler to replace Pareidolia, but I’m worried about losing its critical role in ensuring the first played face card is always effective. Without it, the photo triggers less consistently, although I can typically choose a face card first. It's a tricky choice!\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI'm considering the ranks in the deck, where there are only 6 face cards out of 27, so that's not enough for consistency. I wonder if I can create faces using Tarot, but it doesn't seem to help. Pareidolia is crucial since it enables the photo to double the score on the first played face card. If all cards are face, then any hand can trigger that multiplier. However, even without Pareidolia, I can try to play a face card first, but the uncertainty of drawing face cards is concerning. Keeping Pareidolia seems essential for reliability!\n**Exploring card synergies**\n\nI'm considering how Chad retriggers the first played card, allowing it to score an additional two times. If the photo activates with each score, then it should double the multiplier every time the card counts. With Pareidolia, I can ensure the first card suits the Ancient, maximizing its benefits. So this synergy looks spectacular! I'm thinking about replacing something else with Swash, but Gift Card also has its perks, adding to the multiplier and scaling nicely. It’s a tough choice!\n**Analyzing joker values**\n\nI'm reviewing the sell values of my jokers: Photograph is worth 10, Chad 9, Pareidolia 6, Gift 13, and Ancient 8. If I replace one with Swash, it counts the values of the other jokers but not itself. Swash currently shows a +46 multiplier, presumably if I added it without selling any. However, I can’t do that without making space. If I sell Pareidolia and buy Swash, the multiplier will change based on my remaining jokers. If I sell Photograph instead, the multiplier would be even lower.\n**Deciding on purchases and strategy**\n\nI’m exploring how multipliers work with my jokers. It seems that the additive multiplier from Swash adds later, so it doesn't synergize directly with the multipliers from Photo or Ancient. I need to weigh the pros and cons of replacing jokers like Gift with Swash. Gift gives a nice boost to sell values, but Swash has strong multipliers. Also, I’m considering buying a Celestial pack for better jokers, as it could enhance my scoring significantly. Rerolling options for planets is tempting, but I think focusing on the Celestial pack first is the safer choice.\n**Making a purchase decision**\n\nAs I consider my options, I’ve decided to buy the Celestial Pack to level up my key hands. This will enhance my chances of getting cards like Venus for three of a kind. It makes sense to use it immediately to boost my gameplay. So I'll go ahead and execute that action, choosing to buy the booster. That feels like a solid choice, and I’m excited to see what I get!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
