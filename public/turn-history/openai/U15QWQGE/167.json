{"reasoning":"**Considering tarot strategy**\n\nI'm thinking through the choices in the Arcana pack: the Moon, Magician, and World cards. Given that Bloodstone wants Hearts, converting to clubs or spades isn’t a good idea. The Magician enhances two cards to Lucky, which could boost my flush hearts strategy since scoring more cards increases my chances of winning. I have some hearts in hand already, along with a powerful glass card. However, I need to be careful not to overwrite the glass effect. Enhancing my heart cards seems smarter.\n**Selecting cards for enhancement**\n\nI'm considering how to use the Magician card effectively. It targets cards in my hand and modifies them permanently, which is crucial. I could enhance the J♥ and 10♥, but the 2♥ is a low chip. Since I have Pareidolia, all my cards are face cards. I need to ensure I have hearts for Bloodstone while adding the Lucky multiplier. It’s great that if I enhance two hearts, each can trigger with my flush. So, I’ll select the Magician and target the two heart cards correctly!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,2]"}
