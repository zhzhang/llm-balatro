{"reasoning":"**Calculating hand strategy**\n\nI’m figuring out a hand selection in Big Blind, needing 3000 chips. I have a strong setup with Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Glass Jack. I want to exploit the first card played since it triggers Chad to retrigger two additional times, and Photograph doubles the multiplier when the first face card is scored. \n\nNow, I’m considering how Photograph applies during scoring. It seems like it should double the score each time, which could multiply by 2 for every instance, and with Chad, that shoots up to x8. Plus, the Glass Jack adds a x2 multiplier on scoring, though it destroys 1/4.\n**Calculating multipliers and hand type**\n\nI’m analyzing how multipliers apply when scored and if they retrigger — possibly x2 each time? The glass adds a x2 multiplier for each score, so with three scoring events, that gives x8. Combining that with Photograph means we could get a total of x64 from the multiplicative effects. \n\nAdding a Gift Card could add +10 at the end as an independent trigger. So, our final multiplier could be based on the combination of the score and the hand type. I think a good hand might be a Two Pair with 8s and 4s plus a Jack kicker.\n**Estimating scoring with Jack**\n\nAlright, so Jack will be a part of the scoring, which is great! I need to make sure Jack is the first card scored since Hanging Chad says that the first played card can retrigger twice. That means I should play Jack as the leftmost card. I’m also considering non-scoring cards since they won’t count here. \n\nIf I choose five cards with Jack first and form a two pair, it looks like Jack could act as the kicker, triggering Photograph and glass multipliers. I estimate the chips: starting with 20 base chips for two pair and adding the participating cards gives me 54 chips total.\n**Calculating total chips and multipliers**\n\nThe Mail-in Rebate adds +50 chips, similar to the foil edition, which gives me a total of 104 chips. Now, for multipliers, I start with a base mult of 2. The first scoring card, Jack, triggers both the glass and Photograph. So when I score Jack, it becomes a x2 multiplier from both.\n\nHanging Chad retriggers Jack two additional times. I’m working under the assumption that Photograph applies each time it’s triggered. If that’s correct, the second scoring gives me a mult of 32, and for the third, that jumps to 128.\n**Finalizing hand selection and scoring**\n\nAfter scoring with the remaining cards 8, 8, 4, 4, there’s no multiplier impact. The Gift Card adds +10 to the multiplier, bringing it to 138. The Mail-in Rebate gives me +50 chips but not a multiplier. My total chips would then be 104 multiplied by 138, resulting in 14,352, which is huge!\n\nNow, I’m considering the risk with the glass card, which could destroy itself when played, but I believe it would still score. However, it’s important to have Jack in the first position to ensure it can be retriggered. I’ll arrange my hand correctly, selecting cards 1, 2, 5, 3, and 8 for a two pair type and proceed with my action to play. Since this is big blind, there are no additional debuffs to worry about!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,3,8]"}
