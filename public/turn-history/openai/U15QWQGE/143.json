{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker options**\n\nI'm in the shop with $21 after selling Stuntman, and I now have 4 jokers. The shop is offering Reserved Parking, Lusty Joker, and Acrobat, and we're planning to buy Acrobat since we can only take one more joker. Our core combo includes Pareidolia, which turns all face cards into jokers, and Photograph, which doubles the score of the first played face card. With Hanging Chad, we can retrigger that card’s scoring, making Photograph even more powerful. It seems like the multipliers could stack significantly!\n**Assessing joker effectiveness**\n\nI've got Card Sharp x3, which can be played after scoring to multiply the same hand type by three, and it doesn’t depend on the joker. Acrobat offers a x3 on the final hand, but it has certain conditions. Card Sharp seems easier to activate, especially at higher antes. Without Stuntman, my hand size is larger, so maybe Card Sharp is more valuable. I’ve also got Lusty Joker, giving a +3 multiplier for each heart scored, though that might be limited without heart conversions. Using Lovers could help make wild cards too!\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nIt looks like the wild card can be treated as any suit, which can help with a flush. For Lusty Joker, it seems like it requires a Heart suit to activate, but since wild cards count as any suit, that should work! The Empress also boosts multiplier cards with +4 when scored, which is great. Reserved Parking could be useful, especially with Pareidolia if we hold 8 cards, but we need scoring more than just cash. I wonder if I should reroll the shop for a better multiplier joker since it costs $7, which I can afford.\n**Deciding on joker purchase**\n\nSince I have an open joker slot, buying Acrobat for $6 seems like a good option. I could also consider Reserved Parking, but I can only buy one joker for now unless I sell one of my existing jokers. Acrobat likely stands out as the best choice available, but keeping the slot open could lead to better synergy later. However, keeping it empty weakens my position. I can always sell Acrobat later for about $3, so I’ll go ahead and buy it. Next, I should rearrange the order of my jokers, as their positioning affects triggers.\n**Analyzing joker interactions**\n\nHanging Chad can retrigger the first played card twice after it's scored, and its positioning relative to Photograph is important since Photograph triggers on the first scored card. We want to place Photograph before Hanging Chad so that when the card is retriggered, Photograph activates again. However, the order may not matter too much unless we have multiple retrigger jokers. Since Photograph currently modifies the multiplier during scoring, I realize I don’t need to rearrange anything. I’ll focus on buying the Acrobat card instead!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [3]"}
