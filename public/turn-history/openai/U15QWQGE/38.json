{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card scoring**\n\nI realized that scoring glass gives a 2x multiplier, but there's a risk of destroying one in four cards each time I score. It might be smart to apply this to a card I can afford to lose, especially one that triggers effects like Photograph and Lusty, since they relate to hearts. I also need to consider what consumables I can buy, like Justice, as I currently have none. Rerolling the shop for a stronger joker could be worthwhile too.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m considering buying Justice first since it seems like a solid, low-cost option to fill a consumable slot for later. After that, I can reroll the shop for a better joker and decide whether to sell the Trading Card or Mail-in, depending on what I find. Justice is a tarot consumable, so it would go into my inventory, rather than being used right away. Another option is the Standard pack to potentially add more hearts or face cards, but I’m unsure if that's necessary.\n**Making a purchase decision**\n\nI think it's a good idea to buy Justice now since it's still $18. After that, I want to reroll for new cards, but I need to keep in mind that I can only take one action per turn. The system expects that, so I’ll go ahead and use the buy_card command to make the purchase. Then, we can focus on what to do next once I’ve bought Justice.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
