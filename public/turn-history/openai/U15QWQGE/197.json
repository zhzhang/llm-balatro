{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip gains and strategies**\n\nI'm looking at gains: +25 chips and +2 multiplier, raising chips to 90 with an 8 multiplier. If I consider different plays like Pair level1, it's intriguing how a level2 might yield an additional +15 chips and +1 multiplier. My thoughts drift to using Pareidolia effectively, realizing that many combinations help create better hands. Three of a kind feels easier to hit, especially if I aim for a solid backup plan with Venus. Increasing base multipliers significantly impacts overall chips!\n**Analyzing hand types and multipliers**\n\nFor a flush, my base multiplier is 10, while a three of a kind starts at 11 but shifts to 13, showing a small difference of 2. A full house increases from a base multiplier of 6 to 8. I think I’d choose Venus for a three of a kind because it can give me +2 multiplier and +20 chips. Levelling up hand types increases base chips and multipliers, including enhancements from jokers, which could lead to significant gains with my existing multipliers.\n**Understanding hand contribution rules**\n\nI just realized that only the cards that are part of the highest hand actually contribute chips and triggers. For a three of a kind, that means only 3 cards contribute, which gives me just 3 Smiley triggers for a +15 multiplier, plus one photograph trigger on the first scored card. On the other hand, a flush gets to use all 5 cards, leading to 5 Smiley triggers for +25 total. \n\nWhile a full house utilizes 5 cards, which is better than a three of a kind, I need to consider how my deck distribution might allow forming those hands, especially with duplicates like jacks.\n**Choosing to upgrade for better hands**\n\nI’m considering that upgrading to a full house increases the base multiplier from 6 to 8 and nets me 90 chips, which could serve as a solid backup if a flush isn’t possible. A full house triggers all 5 cards, maximizing Smiley and possibly Bloodstone triggers, especially since I have a higher quantity of hearts in my deck. Earth seems like the best choice here, as it aligns with strengthening the full house and using 5 cards effectively, which may lead to impressive scores with my jokers.\n**Deciding on an action**\n\nI’m thinking it’s time to select pack card 3. There’s no need for specific targets this time; I can just go ahead and use the select 3 option. This feels straightforward, so I'll move forward with that choice. It's great to keep things simple and focused! Now I just need to confirm the selection and make sure everything goes smoothly.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
