{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nSplash allows every played card to count in scoring, which is quite a big deal. You can play 5 cards, earn all chips, and even trigger effects that aren't directly part of the hand. I'm looking at options like Photograph+Chad and how Bloodstone works with heart suits for each scored card. However, I need to decide which joker to replace. Card Sharp might be a strong choice, but I’m limited in hands available. Bloodstone is shaky but has potential with hearts. Perhaps I could use Lovers to create a wild card?\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nPhotograph triggers on the first played face card when it’s scored, and with Pareidolia, any card counts. Chad retriggers the first played card used in scoring two more times, making that card trigger three times in total. If Photograph gives a 2x multiplier each time, then with Chad’s retrigger, it could lead to an 8x total. Plus, if the card is a heart, Bloodstone might add another 1.5x multiplier too, creating a big scoring opportunity altogether!\n**Considering card strategy**\n\nSplash allows all five played cards to score, even if only one is a high card, which opens up multiple Bloodstone chances, not to mention adding chips for each card! This feels like a solid option. But I have to drop a joker, so I’m weighing which one has the least synergy. Card Sharp is powerful but might be less crucial if we can secure a win quickly. However, Bloodstone still has huge potential with all those hearts and retriggers, so it seems worth keeping!\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nIt seems that Pareidolia is crucial for making the first card a face card for Photograph and ensuring synergy with other face cards. While I could consider dropping Pareidolia if we always play a face card first (like J, Q, K), that's not entirely reliable, so I'll keep it. I'm thinking of dropping Card Sharp to make room for Splash. Selling Card Sharp gives me $3, but I’d rather buy Splash directly for $5 without needing to sell anything!\n**Deciding on joker changes**\n\nThe joker slots are full, so I need to sell one to make space. Selling Card Sharp to buy Splash seems like a smart move. I’ll sell Card Sharp for $3, leaving me with $8, and then buy Splash for $3, so I’ll have $5 left. \n\nI need to think about the order of the jokers in terms of triggers: Photograph first, then Hanging Chad, Bloodstone, and finally Splash. Having the right order is essential for scoring, so I’ll prioritize buying Splash and replacing Card Sharp first. Selling Card Sharp now is the first step!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
