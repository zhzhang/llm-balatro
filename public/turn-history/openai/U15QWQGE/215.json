{"reasoning":"**Reviewing game mechanics**\n\nI’m considering how Bull contributes +2 chips per dollar, so dropping $10 reduces chips by 20—it's not a huge loss. Right now, the shop has no tarot cards except for the Hanged Man, which is in the card slot. I can buy and use it, but it would take up a consumable slot. Instead, it might be better to purchase a voucher to increase tarot options for rerolls, hoping to find Justice, The Sun, or Death later. Our build seems to rely more on multipliers, especially with Smiley and Pareidolia around.\n**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI’m working through how the Photograph gives double the score on the first card and how Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card twice. The Photograph seems to activate whenever the first face card is scored. On retriggers, if that card is scored again, I think the multiplier applies each time. From my experience in Balatro, it does—so that means the x2 multiplier could apply three times total with Hanging Chad. That’s a potential x8 multiplier! Great!\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about our best options for the first card, focusing on high-chip bonuses or multipliers. The Photograph affects multipliers regardless of card chips, but we still want to maximize chip gain. We're at max jokers and might consider replacing Bull or Smiley for a stronger xMult joker, but Bull already adds significant chips. Our score suggests a solid deck, but we need triple scores for the boss. I should also consider rerolls and maybe buying a Standard pack for potential upgrades or enhancements.\n**Deciding on card upgrades**\n\nI believe that rerolls for joker upgrades will have a bigger impact than just adding one extra playing card. It makes sense to buy a booster first since we only have one left, and it's cheap. So, my plan is clear: I should go ahead and buy that booster before moving on to rerolls. I'll take action and buy the booster now!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
