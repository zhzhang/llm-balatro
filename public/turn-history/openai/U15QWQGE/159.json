{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop purchases**\n\nI need to figure out my next step in the shop. I have $5, and the options are Rough Gem for $7, Glass Joker for $6, or Blue Joker for $5. I can buy the Blue Joker, but I’d have to sell one of my jokers since my slots are full. My build is focused on stacking, and I'm considering how the Blue Joker will affect my chip count with its independent +chips activation. It seems like it could really boost my game!\n**Analyzing build dynamics**\n\nThe splash effect enhances scoring for cards not in hand, which means more chips and bloodstones. I’m considering dropping Bloodstone, but it provides valuable x1.5 triggers. If I have 5 hearts, I might expect a multiplier of 3.05x with potential wilds. The interplay between Chad’s retriggering and Bloodstone’s effects requires careful consideration; splash makes every card count. Since Photograph triggers on scoring, each sequential trigger can amplify the multiplier significantly. The Blue Joker is enticing for its +104 chips and contributes positively to the overall multiplier.\n**Evaluating chip calculations**\n\nI realize that in my final calculations, the chips multiply by the total, which is a strong advantage. Now, I need to decide what to replace for the Blue Joker. Keeping Splash seems more beneficial, as it lets all cards contribute to scoring. Although without it, I could still build a decent hand. With Splash, even my weaker cards can score. It’s interesting how this synergy with Photograph works since every played card counts, enhancing my scoring potential significantly!\n**Considering Splash's importance**\n\nWithout Splash, if the first card isn’t part of my hand, it won’t score or trigger Photograph or Chad. Splash is crucial because it ensures the first card triggers, even if I'm attempting to make a flush. When I play five cards, it seems like all contribute to the scoring, except for rare cases like four of a kind. However, Splash adds three extra scoring cards, which is a big boost for strategies involving Photograph and Chad. It might make sense to keep Splash!\n**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nThe Blue Joker's +104 chips multiply at the end, which is significant, but I need to consider what to replace for it. Dropping Bloodstone might impact my multiplier, but I can convert hearts using the Lovers wild card, which is beneficial. Bloodstone gives about x1.25 for each heart scored, but with five hearts, I could hit x3.05. However, prioritizing hands like three of a kind is key—so perhaps replacing Splash with the Blue Joker makes sense to boost my chips while still maintaining score potential. Ultimately, selling Splash could lead to a stronger deck fit for gaining money.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI realize that we already have strong multipliers from Photograph and Chad, which might be enough to win without Bloodstone. However, Bloodstone provides valuable scaling, so I'd prefer to keep it. Selling Pareidolia for $6 to buy the Rough Gem while keeping Bloodstone seems tempting, but I might lose some consistency. Considering my limited options, the best improvement appears to be the Blue Joker. Therefore, I’ll sell Splash to make that swap, as it’s less vital. My next action is to sell the Joker for the Blue Joker.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
