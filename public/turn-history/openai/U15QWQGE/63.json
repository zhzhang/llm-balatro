{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop options**\n\nI'm in shop ante4 with $39. I have some jokers like the Gift Card holo that adds a multiplier and boosts sell value. The Mail-In Rebate foil is cool too, giving me independent chips and discard rank payouts.\n\nI see consumables like Wraith, which creates rare jokers but sets my money to zero, not great since I’d lose funds. The shop offers a card that doubles probabilities, but I’m not focused on chance-based effects right now. The Stuntman could give a big chip boost, but with a hand size penalty, I need to weigh the pros and cons.\n**Evaluating hand size and jokers**\n\nIt seems like my hand size is 8, but the -2 penalty from the Stuntman card would bring it down to 6. While I can still make a flush, I have fewer cards to work with, which complicates hitting certain hands and managing discards. However, the +250 chips is a significant boost, especially when considering multipliers from my Gift Card and Photograph. \n\nThe Zany Joker adds a multiplier if I hit three of a kind, which could be useful since my deck might support that strategy. Still, I have a maximum of 5 jokers, so I need to decide which one to sell if I want to buy a new one.\n**Assessing card combinations**\n\nI'm considering the Sixth Sense joker, which may be weak overall but can potentially generate a spectral effect if I play a single 6 first. However, that's not a super reliable option. The Hanging Chad and Photograph combo really excites me because it can yield a massive multiplier if I score using a face card first. \n\nIn a flush, if my first card is a face card, I can trigger the Photograph for a double multiplier and then re-trigger it with Chad. I can achieve up to x8 on that! It makes sense to keep both jokers for the potential of these combinations.\n**Deciding on card selling and purchases**\n\nThe Gift Card offers a steady +10 multiplier and scales in sell value, while the Mail-in Rebate foil gives me a consistent +50 chips and potential discard value, which feels valuable. I'm considering selling the Sixth Sense to make room for the Stuntman, so I’ll sell it for $4 and then buy the Stuntman for $7. After that, I’ll have $36 left. \n\nI’m also thinking about getting the Overstock Plus voucher for $10, which increases shop slots. It’s a good long-term investment. With $26 remaining, I want to consider the Jumbo Arcana Pack for important tarots, since I have the funds. I may need to reroll some cheaper options, but the arcana could be essential for my deck!\n**Choosing the next action**\n\nIn this system, I need to focus on one action per turn, so I have to decide between selling the Sixth Sense and buying the Stuntman. The best immediate move seems to be selling the Sixth Sense to free up a slot, then buying the Stuntman next turn. \n\nWhile I could consider using Wraith now, it would set my money to zero, which isn’t worth it since I have enough funds and I'm eyeing the Stuntman. Therefore, I'll go ahead and sell the Sixth Sense now!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
