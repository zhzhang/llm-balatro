{"reasoning":"**Evaluating multipliers**\n\nI'm considering the multipliers for Blue Joker, which gives +104 chips independently, while Smiley adds +5 multiplier per scored card. If I score a flush with five cards, that's +25 multiplier added, bringing the base multiplier for flush at level 4 to 10. Existing multipliers also include Photograph, which doubles the multiplier when the first face card is scored. If I retrigger, it multiplies again, and the effects seem to stack up quite significantly.\n**Analyzing scoring order**\n\nSmiley provides a bonus multiplier when scored, which happens during the card scoring step, and it seems to add to the overall multiplication effects. Then, with Photograph and Bloodstone, those multipliers apply afterward. Photograph activates during the first face card scoring, multiplying by 2. The order of jokers and effects is important: Pareidolia, Photograph, Bloodstone, Hanging Chad, and Blue Joker. I need to decide if I want Smiley before Photograph for maximum effect on the first card.\n**Determining multiplier order**\n\nI'm deciding to place Smiley before Photograph to add +5 and then apply the x2 multiplier. Bloodstone, which gives a x1.5 boost, should come next. As for Hanging Chad, it retriggers the first card used in scoring two more times, but it seems to act independently. I think it affects the first card’s scoring, but it may also need to be positioned properly among the other jokers during the retrigger stage. However, I still believe keeping Smiley, Photograph, and Bloodstone first makes sense.\n**Deciding which joker to remove**\n\nI’m considering which joker to keep and which to remove. Pareidolia, Photograph, Bloodstone, and Hanging Chad seem essential, so I’ll keep those. Blue Joker offers +104 chips, but I think replacing it with Smiley Face could massively boost my multiplier, leading to bigger scores. While Blue Joker scales with the deck, I believe the added multipliers are more critical, especially as blinds increase. Selling Blue Joker for $2 and then purchasing Smiley for $4 sounds like the right move!\n**Deciding on purchases and actions**\n\nI’m considering buying Arcana or Spectral packs to improve my deck since I’ll have $6 left after selling Blue Joker. Spectral packs offer powerful effects, while Arcana gives immediate tarot use. It's crucial to ensure I have enough consumable space, as I currently have only one Magician. The packs can be used immediately, which is beneficial. \n\nAfter selling, I plan to buy Smiley Face, and I believe selling Blue Joker first is the right action since it frees up space for the next steps.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
