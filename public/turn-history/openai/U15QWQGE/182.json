{"reasoning":"**Evaluating spectral card options**\n\nI'm looking at two choices: Aura or Wraith. Aura adds an edition to one card in hand, while Wraith creates a random Rare Joker and sets our money to $0. We’ve got $2 right now. The Rare Joker could be valuable, but we’re at the maximum of five jokers. If Wraith generates a joker with no space, will I need to sell or will it just disappear? I should consider how that replacement works in the game.\n**Assessing the value of jokers**\n\nI'm considering the risks and rewards of going for a Rare Joker. Sure, it could be a game-winner for ante 7/8, but it sets my money to $0, so losing $2 isn't a huge loss. Still, I might need that money for the next shop. The Rare Joker may not synergize with my current jokers, which are well-matched. Aura can enhance a key card edition, like boosting a polychrome card's multiplier. I have a Glass 9 of Diamonds, but there's a risk of damaging it. Maybe adding a Polychrome to that is worthwhile?\n**Considering Polychrome options**\n\nIf I add a Polychrome to the 9 of Diamonds, it gives a x1.5 multiplier when scored, and combined with the Glass x2, that would be quite powerful at x3. However, there's a risk of it getting destroyed. I wonder if I should apply Polychrome to a sturdier card, like the King of Spades or Queen of Diamonds. Yet, since we're focused on hearts, a Polychrome heart card would be incredible, especially for triggering Bloodstone. I only have the 2 of Hearts in hand; should I add Polychrome to it? Each score would give a x1.5 boost!\n**Clarifying score mechanics**\n\nI need to consider the order of how played cards score. For each card, it’s base chips plus modifications from effects like Polychrome, which gives a x1.5 multiplier when scored. If my first scored card has Polychrome, then with Hanging Chad, I could retrigger it twice, resulting in the x1.5 multiplier applied each time. I'm thinking about Photograph too — it appears to provide a x2 multiplier when the first face card is scored. Wait, does that apply to each scoring instance or just the first time? The wording suggests it applies to every score of that card, which would be huge! Plus, Smiley gives a +5 boost on face card scores, and Bloodstone offers a chance for Heart suits to gain a x1.5 multiplier too!\n**Evaluating strategy for cards**\n\nI want my first scored card to be a heart to benefit from Glass and Polychrome enhancements, but currently, the only heart is the 2 of Hearts, which isn't that strong. I could choose a spade instead, but that would miss the Bloodstone bonus. Bloodstone can still trigger on hearts later, though. I think I might use Aura to enhance the 2 of Hearts to sync with Bloodstone, but that could mess up flush strategy.\n\nIf I play cards left-to-right, rearranging my hand allows me to maximize scoring. I should focus on building strong suit flushes, perhaps clubs since I have a few. Aura could randomly boost a card, but it’s tricky. The Glass 9 of Diamonds is strong but at risk of destruction. Adding Polychrome could be amazing, with big multipliers. Ultimately, choosing the right cards for my hand based on their multipliers and synergy is crucial for a win!\n**Deciding on card strategies**\n\nThe Glass card is strong, and even if it doesn't make the final hand, it can still serve as a high card. However, if I want to focus on a flush and only include the 9 of Diamonds—while others aren't diamonds—it won't count. The King of Spades is a solid choice for higher chips and face value. I'm leaning toward heart flushes to maximize Bloodstone benefits. Since we only have the 2 of Hearts, enhancing it with Aura seems like a good plan to ensure consistency and scoring. Ultimately, I’ll select and rearrange cards to set up the best scoring!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,3]"}
