{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy options**\n\nI'm considering the best use of funds with two jokers already in hand. We have $10, and I'm thinking about buying a celestial pack for $4 and a buffoon for another $4, leaving $2. While a voucher offers long-term benefits, it comes at the cost of immediate upgrades. Since we have strong reroll potential and enough chips, prioritizing the celestial pack to boost hands seems more important right now. I'll focus on buying both boosters instead of the voucher.\n**Deciding on booster purchase**\n\nI can buy boosters after getting jokers, but since the system only allows a single action at a time, I'll start with the first step: buying a card using one of the free jokers. My choice is to buy \"Card 2\" (Gift Card) because the +10 multiplier is really valuable for the next round, though the mail-in is also a good option. I'll proceed with \"buy_card 2\" and ensure the response is in the correct JSON format.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
