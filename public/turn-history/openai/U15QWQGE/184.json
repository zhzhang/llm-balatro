{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about applying x2 on each scoring instance, which seems huge. I want the first scoring card to be the strongest, ideally having the heart trigger Bloodstone. The 2H foil works well for this. Arranging my hand with 2H as the leftmost card ensures it scores first. In a flush, card order is crucial, so I should play 2H first. I’ll keep 2H foil and 5H, but I’m debating whether to hold onto the 9D glass for a backup plan.\n**Planning discards and keeps**\n\nI'm figuring out my discards: if I discard, I need to keep three cards, not just two. Choosing which card to keep is tricky. The 9D glass seems like a strong option, but if I end up with a heart flush, it won't matter since I can play five cards. However, the glass could be distracting. Alternatively, I could keep the Ace of Diamonds for its high value. I’ve decided to keep the 9D glass. I'll discard 10S, 9C, 5C, AD, and 7D, then draw five new cards, aiming for more hearts.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,6,8]"}
