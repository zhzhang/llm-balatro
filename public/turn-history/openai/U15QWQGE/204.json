{"reasoning":"I'm evaluating a strategy for a big blind ante game where I need to secure 75k, but I only have $36 after skipping the small blind. I can either skip the big blind for a Handy tag or play (with a chance of winning) and then go to the shop. If I win, I could buy key items. However, there's a risk if I play big and fail, but past flush hands have performed well. It seems playing big is the better choice!\nI'm gearing up for a round where I need to strategically arrange my jokers for optimal triggers because the order really matters for \"on scored\" effects. Smiley increases points based on face cards, and Photograph doubles the score on the first face card played. Bloodstone boosts hearts, while Hanging Chad retriggers cards. Ideally, I want my first card to be a heart face card to maximize those boosts. I think Photograph should come after Smiley to maximize my scoring opportunities!\nI'm considering the order of my jokers for scoring, specifically how they interact when played from left to right. If I play Smiley before Photograph, Smiley adds a multiplier, then Photograph doubles the score. It's better to have the additive effect first. Bloodstone should also come after Smiley for the same reason. I'd place Pareidolia first because it's passive. Finally, Hanging Chad, which retriggers, should go after the main jokers since it triggers later. The order matters for maximizing my score!\nI think it's best to keep the current order of my jokers: Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, Bloodstone, and Hanging Chad, as it seems to be optimal for my play right now. Since I'm in a blind select, I don't have to change much. I shouldn't skip the big blind because I might miss a chance to shop later. Now, let's go ahead and prepare the action JSON to move forward!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
