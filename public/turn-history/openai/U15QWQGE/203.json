{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nIt seems like \"Skip Tag\" gives immediate rewards of $5 for each skip, and noticing that it could be valuable especially at the endgame stage. When considering the ante 8 final boss, skipping both small and big might be strategic, but shops won't be available afterwards. It's crucial to decide whether to skip small or big before facing the final boss, as that affects the shop availability. Each choice shapes the gameplay significantly.\n**Evaluating shop strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether we really need a shop, especially since we have a solid build but not enough money. Skipping gives rewards that could help purchase in shops later. If I skip the small option, I get to choose a big one but don’t have access to a shop in between, so it’s a trade-off. Skipping small could mean losing out on rewards but saves time. The potential $35 from skipping is appealing! It’s a delicate balance to manage.\n**Analyzing game strategies**\n\nPlaying big could get me $36 plus a reward, allowing for useful purchases to enhance the game. However, I'm concerned about timing, especially with the boss battle and losing random jokers each hand, which affects my scoring. Getting more power through planets or extra jokers is crucial. If I skip small, I’ll get $35 right away, which feels like the best option. Alternatively, I could play small, possibly scoring a quick win, but that comes with limitations on what I can purchase.\n**Considering shop and skipping options**\n\nI’m weighing the choice between shopping now or skipping to get $35 for later. Skipping small means I won’t benefit from joker scaling, but I wouldn’t incur losses either. There's also a \"Handy Tag\" that gives $1 per played hand, which could add up, but it’s less than skipping small. \n\nMy strategy could be to skip small for the immediate cash, then decide about skipping big. If I skip big, I risk missing out on spending before the boss fight, which could be crucial for buying helpful upgrades.\n**Choosing jokers and game strategy**\n\nI think the best approach is to skip the small round and then play big to access a final shop before facing the boss, giving me enough cash. In terms of joker order, their effects depend on the sequence—like having Smiley before Photograph to optimize scoring. Since there’s a possibility that the boss disables one joker, I want to maintain synergy. \n\nThe primary action now is to execute the skip_round, and I’ll take care of that immediately.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
