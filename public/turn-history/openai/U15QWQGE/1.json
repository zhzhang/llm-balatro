{"reasoning":"**Evaluating gameplay strategy**\n\nI'm in a situation where I'm deciding whether to skip the big blind to get a Holographic tag. I need to think about the risks of fighting a boss with just a base deck, especially since the boss debuffs hearts, which I can manage. The chips needed for the boss are 600, and it seems feasible with the right hands. However, skipping big means losing a $4 reward and the chance to shop. I also have to consider the benefits of getting tags for better jokers later.\n**Weighing game strategy**\n\nI'm considering that if I use the tag, it applies to the next shop joker or if I play big, I get a chance to shop after. Using the foil tag for a free joker may help me beat the boss more easily. However, if I skip big and get the holographic tag, I might risk failing against the boss. Despite the risk, playing big could give me more money and better overall options later, especially with the chance to buy upgraded jokers.\n**Analyzing tag strategy**\n\nIf I skip the big blind, I’d get a second free joker later, but I could potentially buy a base edition joker in the shop after playing big. The foil tag applies to the next base shop joker, making it free if I buy it. I need to consider that tags accumulate, so if I skip big, I can stack the foil and holographic tags for a better outcome after facing the boss. I just need to clarify how multiple tags might work together!\n**Evaluating tag impacts**\n\nI realize that each tag affects the next base edition shop joker I purchase, which might become a free foil after use. If I have two tags, I can get two free upgraded jokers, which seems like a great deal. However, if I play big, I miss out on the holographic tag, but I could have some money left for potentially buying one. Plus, playing big allows a shop visit that might offer valuable items, but I need to consider my budget carefully!\n**Deciding on gameplay options**\n\nI realize that if I play big, I can buy at least one joker or pack, and getting a free foil joker means I can use my money elsewhere. It seems optimal to play big to access the shop and improve my chances against the boss. However, I might also consider skipping the big blind to focus on tags. The boss's threshold of 600 seems manageable with a standard base deck and likely scoring patterns. I’m inclined to skip big to grab the holographic tag and maximize my future options!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
