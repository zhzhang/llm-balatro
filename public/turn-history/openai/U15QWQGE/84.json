{"reasoning":"**Evaluating build options**\n\nIn our build, we're not focusing on straights, but we could generate tarots for scaling. However, it seems like we might need to sell a joker slot to make room, which I'm hesitant about. The standard packs add playing cards and maybe enhancements to help us get materials. We've got $13 to work with, and I should consider using Wraith to try for a strong rare joker. But ah, we’re at max jokers, so I need to sell one first.\n**Assessing joker values**\n\nI’m considering which joker might be the least valuable, potentially Smiley or Pareidolia. But Pareidolia provides a huge multiplier with all cards facing, making Smiley always activate too. Photograph can be less reliable without Pareidolia since it needs actual face cards. Smiley gives +5 per card for a hand, adding up nicely. Gift boosts the multiplier and sell value each round, which is great! To fit a rare joker, I might need to replace something like Gift, but I’ll see how it plays out.\n**Considering Wraith usage**\n\nI’m thinking about whether to use Wraith since it can give powerful rare multipliers, but we'd need to sell a joker, which might hurt our synergy. Honestly, I’d rather not gamble right now unless we could spare something like Gift, which only gives +10 multiplier, for a better chance at a rare. Oh, and Wraith sets our money to 0, but if we spend it all first, that might be okay. I could buy packs first, then sell a joker, and then use Wraith afterward.\n**Planning for long-term scaling**\n\nI’m considering the long-term implications for scaling and antes. My build relies heavily on multipliers, but lacks chip scaling. Using Photograph repeatedly can create a huge multiplier, although chips might be low. If I hit a hand like a Flush Level 4, I could earn 80 chips, which could be significant with a multiplier. A rare joker could boost that multiplier, but relying on random draws like Wraith could be risky. I might be better off keeping cash for interest and enhancing my deck with something like Tower for extra chips.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm figuring out how scoring works with chips. For a high card, only the highest card counts, while a flush requires five suited cards, meaning a stone card can't contribute since it has no rank or suit. It can be a filler for things like three-of-a-kind, but it wouldn't score. I'm considering the value of adding different packs to enhance my deck instead of relying on stones. Buying the Jumbo Standard pack seems good for value, plus a reroll for better cards. I need to rearrange my jokers, ensuring Smiley triggers before Photograph for maximum multiplier effectiveness.\n**Deciding on next actions**\n\nThe Gift card offers a +10 multiplier independently, while Smiley and Photograph are in the on-scored stage, and Hanging Chad is for retriggers. Pareidolia is passive. Since the order of independent jokers matters with others, but not here, my first action should be to rearrange the jokers. This is crucial. Then, I can consider buying boosters later. I’ll adjust the indices to 5 for Smiley, 1 for Photograph, 2 for Chad, 4 for Pareidolia, and 3 for Gift. I’ll output this action now.\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [5,1,2,4,3]"}
