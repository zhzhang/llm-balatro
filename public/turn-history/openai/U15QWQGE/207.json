{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m considering keeping queens and playing flush, but it seems tricky. The Mad Joker gives a multiplier, but it doesn't fit our strategy here. The Tarot Merchant's cards aren't helping right now. I could add a standard playing card to my deck, aiming for more hearts or face cards, but it's not crucial. With $48, I have options to reroll for a better joker. Given the final boss's requirements, consistency seems key! We need to strengthen our build to ensure we exceed that 100k score, even if a joker gets disabled.\n**Assessing game tactics**\n\nBull seems like a good choice, even if other cards get disabled. However, if the boss disables something like Photograph or Smiley, we're going to need a backup. Bull adds chips but might lower our multiplier. I could also use The Magician to craft lucky cards that enhance our chances, giving us a small boost when scoring. \n\nBuying bull costs $6, but selling Bloodstone for $3 might help keep our funds balanced. If I sell, I can get $51, buy the bull, and still have $45 left, plus gain extra chips. But I'll lose the Bloodstone, which is tricky since it boosts multiplier potential.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about how randomness affects our chances of reaching 104k. While RNG might help, I need a deterministic approach too. If I estimate a base flush at 80 points, plus chips from cards at around 41, I’m at 121. Jokers contribute significantly, too—like the base multiplier of 10. \n\nWith Smiley, I can get an extra multiplier for each scored card. Photograph seems to apply its multiplier whenever the first face card is scored, including retriggers, which is promising. I think every time that face card scores again due to retriggers, it activates Photograph again.\n**Calculating scoring potential**\n\nAlright, so with three scores, that's a multiplier of x8, which is pretty significant! Adding up, our multiplier could be 10 (base) + 35 (from Smiley) + 12 (Chad retriggers), giving us 57. Multiplying by Photograph's x8, that gets us 456.\n\nThen there's Bloodstone, which provides a chance of x1.5 for every heart scored. If I have 5 hearts, that’s around 2.76 as an expected multiplier. So, with everything combined, I might score around 152k, but the actual score of 104k suggests Photograph may not be retriggering as expected. If Photograph only triggers once, my multiplier drops significantly, leading to a much lower score.\n**Strategizing for gameplay**\n\nIn Balatro, multipliers accumulate during scoring, making things more complex. Strong builds are crucial, especially since losing a joker could drop our score below 100k. To create a buffer, I might consider buying Bull for more chips, but Burglar could also be beneficial by giving additional hands to try again if the first one fails. \n\nHaving more hands increases chances to reach that 100k score even if jokers get disabled. However, losing discards could hinder my ability to assemble hearts for flushes. Since I have a heavy heart deck, I might swap Bloodstone for Burglar while keeping the other key jokers. This strategy lets me maintain potent multipliers while offering more attempts to succeed in the game.\n**Analyzing strategic options**\n\nI’m considering whether to sell certain cards like Pareidolia or Photograph. Selling Photograph would be a huge hit, and Hanging Chad is also critical. Bull could provide consistent output per hand, while Burglar increases the total number of hands. \n\nIn a worst-case scenario with Photograph disabled, I might score only 40k. Though with 7 hands from Burglar, I’d have multiple chances to accumulate points, even if individual hands aren’t strong. The math shows there's a high probability of having at least one strong hand. However, not having discards might complicate things for creating flushes. \n\nSo, buying Bull while keeping discards could help maximize my scoring potential across all hands. The calculation suggests that this move might increase my score buffer significantly, potentially pushing it up to around 181k.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI'm considering the impact if I disable Photograph; my score might drop significantly, but I could still manage with some luck. Bull seems like a solid choice for providing a scoring buffer, increasing my chips by $90, which is great. Replacing Bloodstone with Bull looks promising since it supports reaching 100k, even if a joker gets disabled. \n\nI'll likely sell Bloodstone first to free up a slot and boost my money for future moves. So, I'll sell the Bloodstone joker now.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
