{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop with $0 after using Wraith, so buying isn't an option. I could sell the consumable Justice for $2 to afford a reroll, but rerolls cost $3. Selling a joker could give me enough cash to buy either Tower or Superposition, though neither seems great. I should focus on preserving my build: Photograph, Chad, Pareidolia, Gift, and Ancient to maximize my score with diamonds. The synergy between them is key for multiplying scores effectively.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nWith Chad's retriggering ability, the first card scores three times, and each time, if it's a diamond, Ancient applies a multiplier of x1.5. This means that for that card, we could see a total multiplier of x3.375. Photograph doubles the score for the first face card played and should apply each time that card is scored, so if it retriggers, it stacks as x2 for each instance. This could lead to impressive multipliers. Playing a diamond high card sounds like a solid strategy!\n**Clarifying multiplier mechanics**\n\nI realize that Ancient applies a x1.5 multiplier for each scored card with a diamond suit, and it acts like an on-scored joker. Photograph functions similarly. The order of application is essential; I should apply on-scored jokers from left to right for optimal multipliers. While multiplication is commutative, addition affects how multipliers stack. The Gift adds a +10 independently, and it looks like additive multipliers might be better positioned before multiplicative ones, impacting final scores in a sequence as I score cards.\n**Considering multiplier order and options**\n\nI've realized that the order of applying additive (+) and multiplicative (x) multipliers matters. If I have a +10 from Gift after a multiplier effect, it’s less effective than if it were applied beforehand. Unfortunately, I can’t change the Gift placement, but I can search for +mult jokers that trigger before xmult effects. For now, I'll avoid changing the order, as it seems fine, but we'll have to hold since I can't use Justice without a target card in hand. Plus, I still have $0.\n**Evaluating shop options and strategies**\n\nI could sell Justice for $2, but that wouldn’t help much. Selling a joker could net me $2-$9 towards buying Tower or Superposition. Tower converts a card to stone, which scores +50 chips but has no rank to help with high card hands. Stone cards don’t affect hand type but still score chips. Superposition isn't compatible with my high-card strategy and doesn’t seem worth the cost. So, I might just leave the shop and go for the next round. I'll select round_select for now.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
