{"reasoning":"**Calculating multipliers in scoring**\n\nI'm figuring out how edition triggers work with scoring. When a card is scored, it can significantly increase the multiplier. For instance, if I score Q♦ first, that might get a +30 multiplier through retriggers. Then there's the Photograph card, which gives a x2 multiplier each time it scores. Incorporating the Hanging Chad concept, it seems that each effect retriggers and stacks, potentially leading to an x8 multiplier! That could really make a difference.\n**Evaluating card value for scoring**\n\nI'm considering which card to score first for maximum benefit. The Q♦ adds +10 multipliers each time it triggers, but the x2 multiplier is multiplicative and boosts the totals significantly. However, using a heart card might unlock Bloodstone, which enhances future triggers with a 50% chance. Comparing Q♦ to the 9♥ blue seal, Q♦ provides a quick scoring boost, but we may already be scoring enough chips. It seems vital to focus on scaling with the right strategies, like farming for strong planet cards.\n**Analyzing round strategy**\n\nI’m looking at the blue seal, which guarantees one planet per round if held until the final hand. That’s a strong advantage! But we need to manage our space, as we currently have room for just one consumable. If I hold the 9♥ during the final hand, I can match the planet card to our last played hand type, allowing us to plan our moves. However, I need to consider how many rounds are left. We've got at least three bosses to tackle: ante 6, 7, and 8, totaling around nine rounds remaining.\n**Evaluating card strategy with blue seal**\n\nWith the blue seal, I can aim for about nine planets, which can really amplify my hands. I can use the Lovers consumable to make a key card wild—maybe the Q♦? But since the 9♥ is already a heart, I'm considering if I should make Q♦ wild instead. If the wild card counts as a heart, that could activate Bloodstone when scored. I only have one Lovers, though, so I need to be strategic. Maybe it's best to keep the 9♥ with the blue seal for scaling. I need to weigh the risks since my deck should be solid enough to clear the upcoming blinds.\n**Deciding between scoring options**\n\nI can't assume too much here, but I've scored 11,840 chips with my last high card. For ante 6, I might need closer to 30,000. The Q♦ could significantly enhance my per-hand multiplier if scored first. I'm exploring the potential of using the Q♦ to maximize chips and multipliers through Hanging Chad and Photograph. \n\nUltimately, the Q♦ offers immediate scoring advantages, while the blue seal provides long-term scaling benefits. Considering three antes remain, I lean toward the Q♦ for now to boost my score quickly, even though blue seal offers plant generation down the line.\n**Selecting cards and actions**\n\nSteel cards offer a x1.5 multiplier while held, which is beneficial. My deck includes the steel 5 of spades and the glass jack of clubs, potentially providing a x2 multiplier. While the Q♦ is a diamond, I could use Lovers to make it wild, allowing it to act as any suit—although I'm unsure if it still counts as a heart for Bloodstone. I think it's safer to rely on the Q♦ for its potential x8 multiplier from Photograph and Hanging Chad. I’ll select pack card position 3 and proceed with that action. I'll output the necessary format with positions set to [3].\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
