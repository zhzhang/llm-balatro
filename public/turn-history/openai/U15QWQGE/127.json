{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nIt seems like our scoring relies on maximizing the first card to create the highest hand. We can play flushes of spades, but pareidolia recognizes faces without changing suits. Mystic Summit gives a +15 multiplier when there are no discards. I can force plays using those discards. Swash increases sell values by an additional +35. To buy Swash, I need to sell one joker, likely Mystic, which seems weaker. My ideal joker order would be Photograph, Hanging Chad, Pareidolia, Ancient, and then Swash.\n**Determining joker order**\n\nI'm considering the order of jokers, and it seems like I should place Hanging Chad before Photograph. In this game, the \"on scored\" jokers activate when their respective cards score. Hanging Chad allows the first played card to retrigger twice, meaning it might matter where it sits in relation to Photograph and Ancient. It likely activates during the scoring of the first card, adding those additional retriggers. So, I'm thinking its position is important, but I'm still figuring out how that works.\n**Organizing joker order**\n\nI’m thinking about how to order the jokers: Photograph and Ancient should trigger left-to-right during the \"on scored\" phase, while Hanging Chad activates in the retrigger stage. I wonder if having Hanging Chad before Photograph or Ancient affects anything. It seems like it doesn’t, since it just adds retriggers after scoring. The order might not be crucial since their multiplication is commutative. So, it’s likely that independent jokers like Swash and Mystic don’t need specific orders either, as long as they’re applied after the cards are held.\n**Evaluating joker options**\n\nOur hand shows a low straight, but we often aim for three-of-a-kind or flush. I could consider buying Saturn for added flexibility. With the Lovers tarot boosting wild cards, I have $52 to spend. Buying Saturn for $3 could help if a boss forces straights later. Alternatively, Chaos for $4 offers free rerolls, which is valuable but requires a slot. Since we only have room for five jokers, Swash seems a better choice due to its immediate +35 multiplier. Chaos gives rerolls but may not directly influence scoring as much.\n**Considering joker strategy**\n\nI realize that Chaos could save around $15 and provide options for better jokers, but it would occupy one of my slots. Right now, I have four core jokers plus Swash, and I might need to drop Mystic to make room. Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Pareidolia synergize well; Ancient has decent potential, but its effectiveness depends on the suit. I wonder if it's better to keep Ancient over Mystic. Swash is more beneficial for immediate scoring, making it crucial to retain. Selling Mystic to buy Swash seems the best choice right now, and I should consider joker order for triggers too.\n**Deciding on joker actions**\n\nI’m considering that if a retrigger joker activates after a card scores, its position in the retrigger stage doesn’t really matter relative to others. I think I’ll keep the following order: Photograph, Hanging Chad, Pareidolia, Ancient, and Swash. It seems solid. So, my action plan is to sell Mystic Summit (joker 5) and then buy Swashbuckler (card 2). I’ll need to do this one action at a time, starting with selling Mystic now. Let’s proceed with that!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
