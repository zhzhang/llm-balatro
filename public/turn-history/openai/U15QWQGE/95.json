{"reasoning":"**Planning card play strategy**\n\nI'm in a shop with $7 and need to prepare for the boss by playing 5 cards. I've built a strategy using Photograph, Chad, Pareidolia, and the Ancient Joker, which is currently suited to spades. To score consistently, I want the first card to be a spade to maximize my multipliers. We need to ensure the first scored card matches the Ancient Joker's suit. Currently, I have no consumables available, but there's a Hallucination tarot generation option in the shop.\n**Evaluating card conflict**\n\nI’m realizing there’s a conflict with Ride the Bus because of Pareidolia, which makes all cards face. That means I can’t avoid scoring a face card, but Ride the Bus usually gains multipliers for consecutive hands without scoring any. With Pareidolia, every scoring card is a face card, so I’d end up resetting each hand. Selling Pareidolia seems tricky since it supports Photograph. Venus could offer options for a 5-card boss, but my current pair is already strong from multiplier stacking.\n**Assessing purchase options**\n\nI’m weighing the importance of the base hand multiplier, which might matter, but I think it’s not crucial. I could spend $3, or I could buy Juggler for $4, which increases hand size. That flexibility is huge, especially for the boss's 5-card requirement, allowing me more choices. I’d have $3 left after that. There’s also Venus for $3, but maybe I should reroll first for a better joker. However, the reroll would still cost $3, so it’s a tricky decision!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m thinking about the reroll option, which could provide a strong xmult joker or help with economy. However, with the boss coming up, immediate help like Juggler is crucial since my joker slots are full. Selling Pareidolia is an option if I want to use Ride the Bus, but that would limit Photograph's triggers to only J, Q, K. Losing Pareidolia might compromise consistency and synergies. So, I’ll buy Juggler now and maybe Venus afterward!\n**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI’m considering the benefits of leveling up my three of a kind, as it could significantly improve my chips and multipliers. If I can form trips with spades and two matching cards, that could lead to a big score. Upgrading is helpful, but maybe not essential. Since Venus could increase my chip count and multiplier substantially, it seems like a good investment. Buying Juggler first will give me hand flexibility, and then I might go for Venus to enhance my three of a kind! I’ll sell Pareidolia to open that slot for Juggler, despite its strategy value, as I want to utilize my joker capacity effectively.\n**Choosing the next action**\n\nI’m considering the boss's requirement of 5 cards and how adding extra hand size could be helpful, but I already have 8. Maybe it’s better to keep Pareidolia instead of getting Juggler. Venus seems like a good buy since it doesn’t require a joker slot and can be used immediately. There’s also the Arcana Pack for $4 that can provide useful tarot. \n\nGiven my current funds, I’ll buy the Arcana Pack first, as it might yield beneficial tarot before buying Venus. So I’ll go ahead with buying the Arcana Pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
