{"reasoning":"**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI need to choose whether to play big blind or skip for the ethereal tag and its spectral pack. Right now, I have an investment tag for $25, but if I skip, I’ll go directly to the boss without a shop, and I’d only have $3 left anyway. Skipping might get me the Ethereal tag, which could be powerful. Playing big leads to a shop and potential upgrades, but the boss does have that nasty discard effect. Playing big seems to offer more opportunities!\n**Assessing shop strategy**\n\nThe previous shop had some valuable items, but I need to consider if I should reroll in the new shop. Playing big seems like the best option, but I’m worried about losing the big blind. I need 16,500, which should be manageable with my joker engine. I’m also thinking about rearranging the jokers for scoring since their order matters. Each joker triggers from left to right, and I want to maximize the multipliers' effects when I score. Should I prioritize additional multipliers before the multiplicative ones?\n**Evaluating Gift Card effects**\n\nThe Gift Card gives an independent +10 multiplier after scoring the cards, but it seems that this happens after the multiplicative effects from Ancient and Photograph. I can't change that, which is a bit frustrating since an earlier +10 would boost the total more effectively. The base multiplier starts from the hand type, and then the xmult kicks in before the +10 is added at the end. While the +10 may seem minor once the multiplier is large, it could still help a little. Order may count for Ancient and Photograph since both are on-scored!\n**Planning scoring strategy**\n\nI realize that Hanging Chad retriggers the first scoring card an additional two times, meaning that card can score again, including the jokers. So, it’s crucial to have the highest value card score first, ideally in the Ancient suit to benefit from the x1.5 multiplier. With Pareidolia affecting all face cards, Photograph will also trigger. Therefore, my next action in this Blind select would be to play the round and return it in JSON format.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
