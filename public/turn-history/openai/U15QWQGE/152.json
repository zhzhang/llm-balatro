{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop and need to choose my next action. My current build consists of several components that work well together, especially with the Bloodstone adding a multiplier on hearts. I have $18, but since I'm at max capacity for jokers, buying a new one means I have to sell something. The 8 Ball and Wily Joker don't seem valuable, and while The Star tarot has potential, I'm torn on whether to buy it or go for a Jumbo Arcana pack for more powerful options.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm considering what to buy from the shop. The Jumbo Arcana pack gives me tarot cards, which could improve my deck, especially since I already have The Lovers. I could enhance hearts to trigger Bloodstone, or convert cards to hearts, but that's not the best use. The Arcana pack could include powerful cards like The Sun or even a level-up for high cards, but it’s tempting to buy a standard pack too for more hearts. Ultimately, I think the Jumbo Arcana pack for $6 is the best option!\n**Buying tarot boost**\n\nThe instructions say I can choose one out of five tarots to use right away, which means I won't run into any capacity issues. That's good! I'm planning to buy the Jumbo Arcana pack in position 1. I need to check the command options for buying a booster pack. I'll prepare to send a JSON command with the action \"buy_booster\" for position 1. No intended hand is needed, so I’ll proceed with that!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
