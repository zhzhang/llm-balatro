{"reasoning":"**Analyzing tarot card options**\n\nI see that the Emperor tarot can create up to 2 random cards but requires a room slot. Since I currently have one consumable slot available, it means I can only create one card, which might not be ideal since I might want to save cash for interest. Instead, Card Sharp seems like the better choice. If I decide to buy it, I’ll need to free up a slot by selling something first, perhaps a Joker or even Swashbuckler. The synergy matters here!\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI’ve decided to keep Pareidolia because of its benefits. The Stuntman adds chips, which is nice for scalability, but not essential. I think having three Card Sharps will work well with my high multiplier. I’ll drop Swash for sure. Checking the costs, Card Sharp is Uncommon at $6, and I have $36. I must sell Swash first to free up a slot before buying. After selling, I’ll have $38, leaving me with $32 after the purchase. It’s a good trade-off!\n**Clarifying card interactions**\n\nI realize that retriggering the first played card can be used for scoring additional times, likely during the retrigger stage. Pareidolia seems to work independently, impacting hand recognition and face cards. The order of independent cards matters for maximizing multipliers, with additive multipliers needing to come before multiplicative ones. So, the base multiplier should be calculated as base plus additive, then multiplicative. In this context, Cardinal Sharp provides a x3 multiplier, and Stuntman adds chips, which is helpful. We should prioritize ordering these effects for maximum benefit!\n**Deciding on card actions**\n\nI’ve discovered that Card Sharp operates independently and triggers its x3 multiplier after scoring and on-scored modifications, which is great because it stacks with Photograph’s x2 effects! In this situation, I see that the order of effects in category 5 doesn’t really matter since only Card Sharp impacts the multiplier. Now, I’m thinking about what to do next. I could sell Swash and then buy Card Sharp, but since I can only take one action, I might prioritize selling first. Buying Saturn as a consumable is also an option!\n**Exploring card options and strategies**\n\nI realize that Saturn can be bought and used immediately without taking up a slot, which is great! Card Sharp multiplies the score after scoring occurs, stacking with Photograph effects, making it a valuable option too. I must decide whether to prioritize buying Saturn now or wait since it could disappear. While both seem beneficial, Card Sharp might yield higher benefits in the long run. If I play two pairs, I can trigger significant multipliers with my scoring strategy! It seems like targeting pairs might be the best way to maximize my chip potential.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm considering the required amount for Ante6, which might be around 90k or more. My pair with Card Sharp yields only 13k, so that's not enough. However, I could play a second hand of the same type, like repeating a flush. The first flush could be a smaller score to trigger, followed by a stronger flush that utilizes retriggers. Selling Swash to free up a slot for Card Sharp seems like the best first action. Buying Saturn could help, but my priority should be on securing Card Sharp first!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
