{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop strategy**\n\nShops happen after each round, and if I skip one, I'll miss it for that blind. At ante 6, shops are important, but tags are also useful. I need to consider the economy: playing small gives me a $3 reward and possibly leftover hands for later. If I skip, I get a +3 hand size for the next round but go straight to the big blind. A larger hand size might help win faster, but I might not need it to beat the blinds anyway.\n**Considering foil tag strategy**\n\nThere's a foil tag on skipping the big blind. If I do, the next shop will offer a Joker for free, turning it into a Foil version that gives +50 chips. Skipping the big blind might be more valuable than I initially thought. However, if I play small, I could skip the big for the foil tag, but I'd then face a boss with -1 hand size. Skipping the big means no shop before the boss, but I'll still get to use the tag in the next shop. That could work!\n**Analyzing tag strategy**\n\nIf I skip the small blind for the juggle tag and then skip the big for the foil tag, I can still hold multiple tags. Skipping the small means I miss the shop before the big blind; however, I could still skip the big and then face the boss with the tags. The juggle tag applies to the next round, which would be the boss round if I skip both blinds. I'm curious if the +3 hand size will carry over even though I didn't play the big. I think it might still apply, but I'm not entirely sure if skipping the tags consumes them.\n**Clarifying tag mechanics**\n\nIn Balatro, it seems that tags apply to the next blind I play, even if I skip a round. So when I skip, I obtain the tag, and it applies to the next blind that I actually play. If I skip both blinds, I could have two tags before facing the boss. The Juggle tag might still enhance my hand size when I battle the boss, which is a bonus! While skipping two blinds means no shops until after the boss, the strength of my build could make that okay. Plus, the foil tag might net me a free foil joker, which could be handy.\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nWe have full joker slots, so I’d need to sell one to get the free foil joker. It could be beneficial if the joker is strong. We're at ante 6/8, meaning there are three bosses to beat. The current boss will reduce my hand size by 1, leaving me with potentially 7, which isn’t too bad. I wonder if playing small first to access shops might yield better cards. \n\nWe have potent scoring with Jokers that can multiply scores significantly. While skipping might give me a Juggle tag, I might lose out on potential earnings. I think it's best to play the round instead for the benefits and to set up for the next.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
