{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop options**\n\nI’m in a shop with four jokers and one empty slot. The shop has options like Supernova, Hanging Chad, and Walkie Talkie, plus I have $11. The reroll cost is $5, so I should think carefully. It seems like the best buy is Hanging Chad, which combos well with Photograph. If I use Photograph with the face card, it could retrigger and give extra points. This strong synergy seems promising, and I can buy Hanging Chad for $4!\n**Considering card combinations**\n\nI'm looking at Supernova, which adds multipliers based on the hand played. The full house gives a small +2 multiplier, while I know Walkie Talkie doesn't really fit. Looks like Hanging Chad is definitely the way to go! Once I buy it, I’ll need to rearrange the order of my jokers to ensure Chad triggers properly. It seems like the order is critical: Chad retriggers the first played card after it scores, and I want Photograph to come first in that mix!\n**Understanding joker triggers**\n\nI’m realizing that retriggering causes a card to score again and that scored jokers activate left-to-right during each card scoring. If Chad is a retriggering joker, it likely falls into category 3. This means the retrigger happens after all \"on scored\" jokers trigger for a card. So, if Photograph is earlier in the sequence, it would affect the scoring because it multiplies the score before Chad retriggers. I need to be careful with the arrangement of my jokers to maximize the multipliers!\n**Clarifying scoring sequences**\n\nSo, here's how the scoring works: cards score with \"on scored\" jokers first, then independent jokers like Gift Card apply afterwards. It looks like Photograph's x2 multiplier happens during scoring, which means Gift Card adds its bonus after that. This order seems really important since the gift card bonus doesn't get multiplied by Photograph's effect. In Balatro, Photograph applies at the end as an independent x2 when the first face card scores, which means I might want to keep Gift Card earlier to maximize its benefits!\n**Deciding on joker purchases**\n\nI'm thinking it might be useful to buy Hanging Chad since it can retrigger the first played card for a significant boost. I also considered getting Supernova, but that would fill my slot and leave me with just $5. Supernova has a smaller multiplier but could be valuable if I focus on the same hand type. However, trading seems the weakest option economically since it only gives $3. I think I'll stick with Chad for now and keep my jokers arranged effectively. I'll go ahead and buy Chad!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
