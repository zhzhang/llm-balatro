{"reasoning":"**Considering tarot strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about how tarot requires a target; I can't buy and use without a hand. However, I can purchase consumables to use later in a round when I have a strong card, like a heart face card, for a double multiplier. There's also the glass card that adds x2 multiplier when scored. Applying it to a high-value card, like the king of hearts, seems promising, though there's a risk of destruction. The celestial pack might enhance my flush strategy, but I need to clarify what it offers.\n**Evaluating shop strategy**\n\nI see that the value is high, and I can reroll the shop for $3 thanks to a voucher. The shop currently has two cards after my purchase. Rerolling for good jokers sounds appealing since it's cheap, but should I buy a booster first? In Balatro, boosters may use up shop slots, but I think they're separate. With $25, I can afford multiple rerolls and packs. Buying Justice as a consumable could be beneficial, but it requires selecting a card later. Replacing Trading Card might not be wise, considering it provides income and deck thinning.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI'm considering that Superposition activates with a hand containing an Ace and a Straight, generating tarot. While I could make straights, my plan is to focus on a flush with hearts, as a straight with an Ace is rare. Buying the Celestial pack seems best for scaling since it provides consistent value. I’ll purchase it for $4 and then choose the best planet offered. However, I need to keep in mind the order of jokers since scoring triggers from left to right. Gift Card and Mail-in cards have different independent benefits to consider too.\n**Analyzing scoring order**\n\nI'm realizing that the order of Lusty and Photograph matters because Photograph provides a x2 multiplier and triggers when the first face card scores. In scoring, cards trigger jokers from left to right. If Lusty triggers first, adding +3 multiplier before Photograph means we calculate it as (mult+3) x2. Conversely, if Photograph triggers before Lusty, we end up with (mult x2) + 3. So, it's better to have Lusty to the left of Photograph. The current order is fine, so I’ll go ahead with the action to buy a booster.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
