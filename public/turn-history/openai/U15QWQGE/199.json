{"reasoning":"**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m breaking down the mechanics of the game. With Hanging Chad, the first played card can score multiple times, potentially earning Smiley +5 each time it scores. The Photograph provides a multiplier of x2 whenever the first played face card is scored. If this card triggers again due to Chad's retrigger, it seems like Photograph might apply its multiplier each time the score occurs. So, it could effectively lead to an x8 effect, which sounds really powerful!\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI’m considering the Bloodstone, which gives a 1 in 2 chance for played Heart cards to score at x1.5. With Pareidolia, all cards become face cards, but their suits remain unchanged. If I play a flush of hearts, it seems like I could expect x2.76 as a multiplier. However, Ice Cream adds +100 chips but costs -5 chips for each hand played, which means I’d have to replace a joker. That downside may not make it worth it, especially since Midas Mask converts all scored face cards to Gold cards.\n**Analyzing card purchase strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about the Gold card, which gives $3 if held at the end of a round. The challenge is that these cards will end up in the discard pile after playing, and while they could be drawn later, it may not be needed in the ante8 endgame. Plus, replacing a joker to buy one doesn’t seem worth it. The Sly Joker offers +50 chips for a Pair, but my typical flush might not include it. \n\nIt seems more sensible to buy a Standard Pack for $4, which doesn’t require a joker and can enhance my hand, possibly benefiting Bloodstone. With $8 available, I could buy the Standard Pack, or maybe reroll or get Ice Cream, but I feel like the Standard Pack is the better option.\n**Considering card replacements**\n\nI'm exploring whether to sell Smiley to buy Ice Cream. Smiley gives +5 multipliers for each scoring event. If I play a flush with 5 cards and the first card retriggers twice, that’s a total of 7 scoring events, resulting in a +35 multiplier. The base multiplier for a flush is 10, so together, that’s 45 before other multipliers kick in.\n\nIf Photograph triggers on the first card's scoring three times, that could bring the total to an x8 multiplier. If I were to remove Smiley, dropping that +35 would be significant, making it not worth the 100 chips. \n\nReplacing Bloodstone with Ice Cream could be an option, especially if I don't rely solely on hearts, since Bloodstone may not always be effective.\n**Deciding on deck strategy**\n\nI'm pondering the expected multiplier, which could be about x1.5^k with k hearts. If I want a flush, it might be safer to aim for any suit, keeping in mind that Pareidolia doesn’t change suits. To really maximize this, I could try tuning my deck to always play heart flushes, but I’m not sure if I have enough hearts available. Previous flushes have scored well, so maybe it’s worth it for Bloodstone.\n\nEven if it’s not essential, Bloodstone offers potential multipliers better than just gaining +100 chips. I could also use the Magician on a strong card, but I need a hand to target, and right now there’s none in the shop.\n\nSo, I’ll buy a Standard Pack booster to improve my hand without sacrificing jokers. After that, I’ll see what choices I have, like hearts, red seal, or steel cards. I’ll output the purchase as \"buy_booster 1.\"\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
