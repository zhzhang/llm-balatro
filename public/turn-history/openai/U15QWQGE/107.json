{"reasoning":"**Evaluating heart counts**\n\nI'm evaluating the drawn hearts. If there are enough to create a flush with five hearts (like J♥, 2♥, and three new hearts), I can play them. But I want to ensure that the highest chip heart is my first played card among those selected.\n\nI think about rearranging my hand to position the highest chip heart first. It’s interesting how the scoring order is based on how the cards are played. Since I don’t have enough drawn info yet, the best move might be to discard five non-heart cards to look for more hearts. I'll make one discard now.\n**Choosing discard positions**\n\nI'm looking at my hand, which includes A♠, K♠, 10♠, J♥, 2♥, J♣, 9♦ glass, and 6♦. I think it might be a good idea to discard positions 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. I’ll keep 7 (the glass) along with the hearts at positions 4 and 5. That means I'll discard a total of five cards. I’ll set up the discard action in JSON format as \"discard\" with positions [1, 2, 3, 6, 8]. No need for the hand type right now.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,6,8]"}
