{"reasoning":"**Deciding on gameplay action**\n\nI need to choose an action, and I can’t skip the boss encounter, so I’ll just play the round. Maybe I should consider rearranging the jokers? It seems like I've already optimized their order though. Since the boss diamonds are debuffed and it doesn’t affect the jokers, and there are no consumables, I’ll just go ahead and play. I’ll return a JSON action to play the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
