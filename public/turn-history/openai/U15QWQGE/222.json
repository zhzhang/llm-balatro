{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card scoring**\n\nI'm parsing the card scoring sequence, which has a base score and involves red seals and jokers in category 3. Sock and Buskin retrigger jokers when scored for face cards, and Hanging Chad retriggers the first scored card twice more. It seems that the first card can get the base score plus the additional triggers from Chad and Sock. I'm considering the play order, where the first played card scores base points and then applies the retriggers. So, for the first card, I need to clarify if Sock also applies.\n**Calculating scoring multipliers**\n\nRetriggers are additive, resulting in a total for the first card of 4 (base 1 + 2 from Hanging Chad + 1 from Sock). Other cards score 2 each, which is significant for Smiley since each face card scoring adds a +5 multiplier. With 5 cards, the total scoring events are 12, leading to a +60 multiplier. The Photog doubles each scoring event of the first card, which could lead to a massive x256 multiplier when combined. That's really impressive!\n**Deciding on card swaps**\n\nI’m considering buying Sock and Buskin since I need a joker slot and already have 5 filled. The Idol is variable, but keeping it for the boss makes me hesitant—it’s unreliable. Sock is consistent and significant, so maybe I should sell the Idol. My core synergy includes Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, and Hanging Chad, and Sock would definitely enhance that. Selling the Idol for $3 and buying Sock for $6 seems like the best move. I also wonder about getting The Chariot, but it might not be necessary for the boss.\n**Determining card actions**\n\nI need to respond with one action, and it looks like selling a joker first makes sense to create space for a new purchase. Selling the Idol seems like the best choice since it feels the weakest compared to others. I considered selling Smiley, but it's still essential for its multiplier. I also want to keep Pareidolia, Chad, and Photograph, so it’s probably best to stick with my core cards. Therefore, my action will be to sell the Joker, specifically the Idol.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI see there's an option to buy Sock and Buskin without selling any cards if there's room. But since I'm at the max of 5 cards, I need to sell first to create that space. So, I’ll focus on selling now, as that will be my next action. After selling, I can plan to buy card 3, but for now, I'll stick to the user’s request for just one action – which will be to sell.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
