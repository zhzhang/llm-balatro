{"reasoning":"**Considering scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm thinking that each scoring event of a specific card likely triggers the Joker effect every time it scores. In Balatro, playing a face card doubles the multiplier whenever it scores, including retriggers. So if Chad retriggers it twice, that would be a huge x8 multiplier. We should focus on getting the first scoring card to be a face card in our hand. Also, buying the Overstock Plus voucher seems smart for expanding shop slots later. Booster packs would help improve the deck too!\n**Evaluating consumables and deck improves**\n\nI see that we currently have one consumable (Wraith) instead of the maximum of two. The Arcana provides tarot cards that we can use immediately without taking up space, which is helpful. Buying an Arcana would improve our deck — cards like The Empress and The Magician seem useful. We should prioritize purchasing the Overstock Plus voucher to expand shop slots for long-term benefit. With our funds and the ability to reroll for better jokers or planet cards, it seems worth it!\n**Considering purchases and strategy**\n\nI'm thinking that rerolling could reveal a planet card we might want to buy, although we can't target planets. Right now, we have only one consumable slot open. We could either buy and keep the planet or use it immediately if it appears. Selling Wraith could free up space for a useful planet, but I also need to consider the Jumbo Arcana pack for deck improvement. Ultimately, buying the voucher seems like a strong choice for future shops, even if it doesn’t have an immediate effect on combat.\n**Assessing ante and purchases**\n\nI'm re-evaluating our ante costs. At ante 4, I think the small blind should be around 1800, but I'm not entirely sure. Regardless, we likely have enough scoring. Investing in our economy seems smart, so I want to buy the Overstock Plus voucher first. After buying it for 10, I'll have 26 left for the Arcana pack and rerolls as needed. It looks like buying the voucher now is the best action! So, I’ll go ahead and buy the voucher.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
