{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm in a shop, and I have four jokers after selling a card sharp. I need to decide on some purchases. My options are Splash for $3, Rough Gem for $7, Glass Joker for $6, and Blue Joker for $5. My build is mult-based: Photograph + Hanging Chad + Pareidolia + Bloodstone. The synergy is fascinating! I think I can maximize my multiplier with these cards, especially if I play a heart as the first card for additional triggers.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI realize there's a 50% chance that each card's effects are multiplicative. If I buy Splash, it allows all played cards to count in scoring, so each heart's value can trigger Bloodstone. With Pareidolia, all cards are faces, and Photograph gives a x2 multiplier on the first face card, leading to an x8 multiplier overall. Splash won't affect Photograph since it’s already scored. I should buy Splash for $3, leaving me $5, but I also consider buying Blue Joker for its benefits. However, I’ll need to sell something since I have only one empty slot.\n**Weighing card options**\n\nShould I go for it? The Blue Joker adds +2 chips per remaining deck card, which lands me at +104 chips. While chips are valuable, my multipliers are huge. The baseline 104 chips can be significant, especially if I have high card values. Bloodstone offers variable x1.5 triggers on heart cards, which pairs nicely with Splash for even more synergy; I probably want to keep that. Also, Keeping Pareidolia makes sense for ensuring all face cards. Photograph with Chad delivers a strong x8 multiplier, making those essential. So, my final jokers would likely be Photograph, Chad, Pareidolia, Bloodstone, and Splash.\n**Deciding on joker purchases**\n\nIt seems like buying Splash is the best option. Rough Gem gives $1 for each diamond scored, and with Splash, playing five diamonds could earn me $5 per hand, which is a huge boost. However, it's not scalable for chips, and chips matter less at ante 6, but could be useful later. While I could buy Rough Gem, I'd have to sell a core joker. The Glass Joker seems less appealing since it could randomly destroy important cards. So I’ll buy Splash for $3 to fill that slot and consider the order of my jokers, with Photograph likely triggering first.\n**Understanding joker mechanics**\n\nHanging Chad allows me to retrigger the first played card used in scoring two additional times, which is pretty powerful. In terms of joker order, during scoring, I need to trigger from left to right, which includes base chips and modifiers. The order between Photograph and Bloodstone matters since placing Photograph first multiplies the total before Bloodstone adds its multiplier. However, since there are no plus multipliers in play, the order won't affect the outcome. Splash modifies scoring since every played card counts. I can buy another card without needing to sell anything, so I’ll go ahead and do that!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
