{"reasoning":"**Choosing cards wisely**\n\nSo, I've just bought my first Arcana pack and picked the Magician, targeting cards 1 and 2 to get two Lucky hearts. I'm back in the shop with $4 left. Options include Odd Todd for $4, which I can afford and gives a bonus for odd ranks. My strategy focuses on a flush with hearts, which consists of various ranks. I need to figure out if I should buy Odd Todd or a booster and which joker to drop!\n**Comparing joker options**\n\nI'm considering whether to replace the Blue Joker, which gives a flat bonus of +104 chips, with Odd Todd, which provides +31 chips for each odd rank scored. If I average 2-3 odd ranks in a flush of five cards, that's about +93 chips for three odds and +124 for four. However, my flush relies heavily on face cards, which are even, limiting Odd Todd's effectiveness. The Blue Joker offers consistent, larger gains, so I think I’ll skip Odd Todd.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m thinking about buying an Arcana pack for $4 to get some additional tarot cards, which I might convert into hearts to enhance my deck. If I buy it now, I can use it immediately, targeting a hand. Alternatively, I could reroll the shop for $3, but that's risky since I wouldn't have enough left for anything good. I should go for the Arcana pack to improve my deck instead. So, I’ll buy the booster!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
