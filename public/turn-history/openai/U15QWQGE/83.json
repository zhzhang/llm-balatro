{"reasoning":"**Thinking through a purchase**\n\nI need to take action and buy the Smiley face card along with Pareidolia, since it creates strong synergy with all cards facing up. I have $17, and its cost is $4, so that’s a good deal. After the purchase, I want to rearrange the jokers, placing Smiley before Photograph since that helps with the scoring triggers from Chad. I should finalize the order based on how the passive effects work. For now, buying Smiley is the priority.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
