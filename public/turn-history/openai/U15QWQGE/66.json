{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game options**\n\nI'm in the shop and need to decide what to do next. I've already bought a voucher, and right now, the shop offers various cards and boosters. I can’t buy new jokers because I have full slots, unless I sell one. My core strategy involves using Photograph and Hanging Chad to trigger effects with the first played card, which needs to help with scoring. \n\nI'm considering options like Even Steven, which boosts scores for even ranks but reduces my hand size. There’s a lot to weigh here!\n**Assessing jokers and strategies**\n\nI’m looking at a common joker that costs 4, but I need to sell one first. I'm considering which joker is the weakest. It might be the Mail-In Rebate because it adds +50 chips and economic potential but is less critical since my economy is already solid at $26. \n\nGift Card adds value by giving a +10 multiplier, while Photograph and Chad are core cards. I think Mail-In Rebate is the weakest choice since scaling multipliers could be more beneficial than chips, especially with Even Steven’s potential for substantial scaling in a tuned deck. The World tarot helps improve flush consistency, which is a plus since my main hand is focused on that.\n**Evaluating consumable cards**\n\nI’m looking at a consumable card in the shop, specifically a tarot that requires targets. I can’t use the \"buy_and_use_consumable\" method because I need targets in hand first. However, I can buy a card for $3, like The World, and hold it until I have suitable cards in a round. \n\nTypically, I can use consumables from the shop anytime, but with this tarot, it seems I need targets to utilize it. In this game, I think I can use tarots immediately and target cards from my deck, which adds more strategy.\n**Clarifying consumable usage**\n\nI’m puzzled about consumable usage in the shop. The system indicates that to use a consumable, I typically need target cards in hand during a round. However, it looks like tarot cards can be used immediately on selected cards shown in the shop.\n\nBut I can’t use \"buy_and_use_consumable\" if it requires targets from the hand, which complicates things. The World tarot converts cards to Spades, but I need to have a visible hand to use it, meaning it can’t be used in the shop after all.\n**Planning card strategy**\n\nI can indeed carry the tarot into the round and use it while playing, which makes buying The World a good option to potentially create a strong flush by converting cards in hand to spades. I might shift to a spade flush strategy if needed.\n\nWraith could create a rare joker, but it sacrifices my remaining money to zero, which is a significant risk. I could buy a Jumbo Arcana Pack for $6 to strengthen my deck with better cards before considering The World. \n\nSo I think my priority should be to buy the Arcana Pack first, then evaluate whether to keep The World depending on my remaining funds. I'll go ahead and make that purchase!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
