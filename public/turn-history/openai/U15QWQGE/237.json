{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI’m considering the strategy for our card game. If we play 5 cards, I’ll have 3 left in hand — the steel J clubs, foil mult J clubs, and holo bonus Q diamonds. The only card in hand that triggers is the steel for a 1.5x multiplier. The boss might disable a random joker each hand, which we can’t control. So, I need to be mindful about the order to play cards, especially since Photograph activates on the first played face card.\n**Planning card play order**\n\nWith Pareidolia off, only the Q, K, and J are considered face cards. Sock can retrigger them, while Seltzer retriggers all five. I should choose a face card that will be retriggered first — any of the Q, K, or J works, but making it a heart will activate Ancient triggers. Playing the K hearts first is an excellent idea since it's both a face and a heart. I'll specify the indices to ensure the K is positioned first in the order we play.\n**Optimizing card scoring**\n\nI’m thinking about playing the wild queen last since it’s a face card that triggers Sock, but it may not impact the outcome directly. The Ancient effect gives a 1.5x multiplier for each heart card scored, and the order doesn’t matter, except for the first played face card, which triggers Photograph for a double multiplier. I want to ensure that our first scoring card is the K hearts to maximize the multiplier for subsequent cards. Getting that card in first position is crucial!\n**Understanding retriggers and multipliers**\n\nI’m examining the interactions with Sock and Buskin which can retrigger all played face cards. After the K hearts scores, it retriggers and applies the Photograph effect again, doubling the multiplier each time that card scores. This means significant opportunities for points! Seltzer retriggers all played cards for the next 10 hands, leading to each card scoring twice. If Sock retriggers face cards as well, it's possible they could score three times. The combination of these effects could amplify our scoring strategy immensely!\n**Planning next actions**\n\nI'm considering that retriggers might stack, allowing for potentially three total scores (one initial plus two retriggers) or as many as four if they're treated separately. The multiplier from Ancient adds 1.5 for each heart card that scores, and having the steel card held adds another 1.5 after scoring. This could lead to huge scores, possibly exceeding 100k! So, it seems like a good time to use the Magician consumable. I’ll specify cards 3 and 6 for action, making the K hearts and 5 hearts lucky. Let’s format this as a JSON action!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,3,6]"}
