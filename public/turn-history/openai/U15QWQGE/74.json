{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shopping actions**\n\nI need to decide on my shop actions with $14 and good jokers. The shop offers Neptune (straight flush), The Star (convert to diamonds), and Saturn (straight). I have a strong flush level 4, but there's no planet for a flush. Rerolling costs $4, but I’ve seen different costs mentioned. I can buy Saturn for a straight, though I rarely play those. The Star could help with a consistent flush if I convert cards, but that might make it harder to flush since my hand size decreases.\n**Assessing card options**\n\nI realize that my hand size reduction means I draw fewer cards, making it harder to get flushes. The Star might help by converting cards to a single suit, allowing conversion of up to three selected cards in my deck. However, it requires targets in hand, and since I can't use it immediately after buying, I can only store it. It seems The Star is a consumable, and since I have full consumables, I can't buy it unless I sell or use one. Wraith, however, can be used anytime, but using it now would leave me with $0, which is risky but possibly worthwhile if I'm falling behind.\n**Evaluating joker options**\n\nCurrently, my jokers are decent, with a good synergy between Photograph and Chad, and Stuntman providing huge chips. However, there’s room for better multipliers. Losing money could hurt future shops, but since we’re already ante 4, maybe I need power for the endgame. Wraith produces a random rare joker, which could be something great or mediocre. I need to sell one joker to make room, but selling would be boosted by the Gift Card, which increases sell values. Currently, if I sold now, I'd gain cash but also lose out on potential.\n**Planning shop strategy**\n\nThe best plan might be to keep my money and reroll the shop to find a useful planet for a flush, something like Death tarot or a joker. Each reroll costs $4, so with $14, I can reroll twice and still have $6 left. To maximize interest, I could leave $10 to earn interest, which means a single reroll is fine. I hope to find a flush planet, tarot, or a joker. Also, using Justice with the Glass Joker could be interesting—glass enhancement gives a x2 multiplier and a 1/4 destroy effect. If the Glass Joker is destroyed, it gains a multiplicative x0.75 multiplier, likely adding to its total.\n**Planning my next moves**\n\nSo, I figured out that when a card gains an x0.75 multiplier, it increases the base multiplier for the Glass Joker. It starts at x1 and can go up to x1.75 with destroyed cards. Using Justice to create glass could help, but there's a risk of losing the card. Wraith sets money to zero, so I could sell it to free up space for The Star, which permanently converts hand cards to Diamonds. However, I need to reroll the shop to find more valuable planets like Saturn or Neptune, since we can use buy_and_use. It makes sense to reroll with my $14 to look for better options!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
