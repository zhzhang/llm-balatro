{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card combinations**\n\nIt seems this strategy might be less utilized since it requires five cards. I wonder if we could attempt a flush with a heart-heavy deck, but the Ancient suit changes each round, which complicates relying on hearts for a flush later on. It's easier to go for trips or maybe a full house with Earth. I could aim for a straight with Saturn or two pairs with Uranus. So, I’ll choose Venus and use select 2 without targets.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
