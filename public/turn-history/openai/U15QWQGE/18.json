{"reasoning":"**Considering discard strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about using our last discard to try and find more Aces, which could give us a plus $5 each. But I also have to consider how many good cards to keep. It might be helpful to use the last discard just to attempt to draw an Ace and then discard it, but then I’d have one discard left. The first discard lets us draw a new card, and then I can discard again if we draw an Ace. It’s a bit complicated!\n**Evaluating discard options**\n\nI'm considering using our second discard to try and cash in for $5, aiming for a total of +$10. It might be better, though, to use the first discard on five cards, including an Ace, to draw five new cards, which increases the chance of getting another Ace and still nets $5. But I have to remember that I only have two discards left, and discarding five now will leave me with one. I need to weigh the risk of losing high-value cards!\n**Maximizing discard strategy**\n\nI want to be careful not to accidentally discard all the Jacks, especially since we might want them for the boss. I think I need to keep a good hand for the boss round, but after winning the big blind, I’ll have a chance to shop and then face the boss with a new hand. So, the current hand doesn’t really matter for that round. Since discarding doesn’t change the deck itself, I can focus on maximizing my money and use both discards to try and pull another Ace.\n**Calculating discard impact**\n\nI need to be cautious since the Mail-In Rebate pays for each discarded Ace. If I discard the current Ace and potentially any other Aces in my hand, I could earn $5. After that, the new hand might include more Aces. I can then use my second discard to get rid of any newly drawn Aces for extra money. However, I’m using all my discards, so I can’t adjust my final hand. \n\nNow, let’s figure out the expected value! With a 35-card deck and two Aces, discarding five cards can give me a probability of drawing at least one Ace of about 27%. It’s not a huge chance, but it’s there! If I only discard the Ace, my probability drops to around 5.7%.\n**Analyzing discard strategy**\n\nI need to consider my discard strategy carefully. If I discard five cards, including my current Ace, I can potentially earn $5 for each Ace later on. It seems the best approach is to discard five cards to maximize my chances. I can draw five new cards, and if any Aces appear, I can include them in my second discard. \n\nI want to avoid discarding all Jacks, but since I have 8 cards, discarding 5 will leave me with 3—after drawing new cards. I might select my Ace of Clubs and four arbitrary cards. Keeping Jacks for a three-of-a-kind might be useful. However, if drawing new cards resulting in low values occurs, I still have good base scores. I'll go ahead and discard those five now while keeping my strong cards for the next round!\n**Weighing discard options**\n\nAfter the big blind, I’ll start the boss blind by drawing from the deck, and I need to think carefully about what to discard. Discarding high-value cards like Aces or Jacks could limit my chances for the boss round. Our deck has 35 cards, and I believe the discard pile will be shuffled back into the deck at the end of the blind, so discarding now won’t have a permanent impact.  \n\nTo maximize my earnings, if I discard an Ace now, I gain $5 with minimal disruption. I might consider using the last discard later to fish for more Aces, but it's a low probability. Ultimately, discarding the Ace keeps a strong hand while securing some money.\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI need to figure out which cards to discard for the best strategy. If I discard 5 cards now, including my Ace, I may not have it available in the next round unless I draw it again. I believe the deck does shuffle between blinds, so discarding does not have a long-term effect.\n\nI'll discard the Ace, both Kings, and a 9 to clear some space while keeping my Jacks for potential three or four of a kind later. I’ll go with discarding positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Let's proceed with that!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,7,8]"}
