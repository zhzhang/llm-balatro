{"reasoning":"**Exploring card play options**\n\nI’m considering different strategies for playing cards. We could go with a flush using a wild queen and hearts, but we need to draw more hearts to make it work. There's also the option of creating a straight hand, but it doesn’t seem to fit. A pair of sixes could work, especially if we incorporate hearts for bloodstone triggers. However, only the scoring cards count, so the first six needs to be a heart for it to work.\n**Analyzing game strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about playing a high card with a heart, but more hearts won't score unless I get a flush. To trigger multiple bloodstones, I need a scoring hand with several cards, such as a flush, straight, or high card. Aiming for a flush using all hearts could be key since it allows for all cards to score. Each scored card can trigger bloodstone chances, and the first played face card could also multiply scores if it triggers properly!\n**Calculating flush potential**\n\nIf I play 5 hearts, I can trigger 5 bloodstone chances plus 2 extra from the first card, giving me a total of 7 chances. The expected multiplier would be about 4.77. My base flush multiplier is 10, and with the photograph multiplier, I could reach 80 total. Adding chips gives around 204, leading to a potential expected return of 77,928, which seems promising! But I need to make that flush happen. Currently, I have 4 hearts and can fish for one more by discarding non-heart cards.\n**Calculating heart draw chances**\n\nThere are 15 hearts left in the deck out of 44 cards. The chance of drawing at least one heart in four attempts is about 82.5%, which is promising! This means I can potentially play a flush with the queen as a wild card. To achieve that, I should discard 4 non-heart cards to try to draw a heart. I’m considering which non-hearts to get rid of, like the 7 of spades and others, while keeping the wild queen and a backup of my existing hearts. Keeping a pair of 6s might not be necessary, especially since aiming for a flush seems better.\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI’m thinking about which non-heart cards to discard. Currently, I have a queen (wild), two 7s of spades, a jack of hearts, two hearts, and a couple of clubs and diamonds. I’m considering discarding the 7s of spades, the 2 clubs, and the diamonds to keep a good hand. After the discard, I'll be left with 4 cards and draw 4 new ones, hoping to get at least one heart. If I don’t draw a heart, I can discard again, but I’m limited to 4. So, I’ll go ahead and discard the cards I listed.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,6,7,8]"}
