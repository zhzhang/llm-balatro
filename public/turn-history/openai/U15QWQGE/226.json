{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI see that we can reroll multiple times, but we ultimately need to beat the boss. Our current setup is scoring over 100k on a flush with the big blind, but the boss might require a higher score, potentially around 400k to 1 million. With ante 8, the boss might demand around 300k-500k. Since we already have 104k on the flush, I wonder if buying a basic Joker +4 multiplier would help. However, I can't seem to do that because my slots are full, so I need to consider selling something. Selling Pareidolia seems like a possibility, but it might only trigger actual face cards, which could reduce our overall effectiveness.\n**Analyzing card scoring strategy**\n\nI'm looking at how Smiley and Gluttonous triggers when a card scores, and the order of additive multipliers is crucial relative to Photograph's x2 multiplier. I need to have my additive multipliers trigger before Photograph, which activates on the first played face card that scores. \n\nTo maximize the score, it's vital to apply as many +multipliers before Photograph triggers. So, I should place Smiley and Gluttonous before Photograph in my sequence. Chad and Sock, which are retrigger effects, should follow. The sequence goes: card scores, on scored jokers, and then retriggers, including any left-to-right jokers, to utilize the retrigger potential effectively.\n**Clarifying retrigger mechanics**\n\nI'm sorting out how Chad and Sock fit into the retriggering joker category since they trigger after the on scored jokers. Their order matters, so they should come after Smiley and Photograph in the left-to-right sequence. \n\nIn the on scored stage, after card modifiers, the retriggering jokers will activate. It’s uncertain if they count as \"on scored,\" but they seem to trigger in the retrigger step afterward. The sequence states that each card scores left-to-right, affecting retriggers since they might allow Photograph to trigger again. Also, remember that Photograph gives an x2 multiplier when the first played face card scores.\n**Determining scoring order**\n\nWhen the first face card scores, it should trigger every time, even during retriggers, since it's significant. I want Photograph to come after Smiley, so the x2 multiplier activates after the +5 is added, which is great because I already arranged that. \n\nNow, regarding Sock and Chad's order: Sock adds one retrigger and Chad adds two, but their sequence may influence how retriggers play out. Smiley’s effect is additive and based on scoring, so its order doesn't matter. Since Photograph multiplies the current score each time, if the first card scores multiple times, it could lead to a hefty x16 multiplier if triggers occur as predicted.\n**Preparing for the final boss**\n\nEach time I score with the first face card, Smiley triggers a +5 before Photograph takes effect, essentially building up my multiplier rapidly. I want to keep that order, ensuring I maximize scoring. \n\nChad and Sock's placement is also important for retriggering. While I consider potential replacements for jokers, I realize I should focus on improving for the final boss round. The Violet Vessel might require up to 1.2 million chips, and we should anticipate that. My best bet might be to aggressively reroll for better jokers or consumables, specifically looking for rarities like Blueprint or Brainstorm that could enhance my multipliers before the boss encounter.\n**Assessing rerolling strategy**\n\nI’m considering rerolling in the shop without the Tarot Merchant, where I might discover better jokers. My plan is to check if I can slightly optimize my joker arrangement. Currently, my order is Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, Chad, and Sock. The order is mostly good, but I’m wondering if Chad and Sock’s placement affects the triggering sequence since they both add retriggers.\n\nIf Sock triggers first, that adds one, and Chad then adds two for a total of three. The total retriggers could stack, but I know from experience that retriggers don’t cause additional retriggers, they just apply to the original scoring. \n\nSince we have enough money, it seems wise to proceed with rerolling in the shop and see what I can find! Let’s go for it!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
