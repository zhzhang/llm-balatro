{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop upgrades**\n\nI'm exploring a shop after using a spectral pack. It seems like the selected Aura might have applied a random effect to my 8 of Hearts, but I can't see it directly. Right now, I have jewels like Joker +4 mult and Zany Joker +12 mult if I get three of a kind. I'm maxed out on jokers, so to buy more, I'd need to sell one. Are these upgrades worth it? I have jokers like Gift Card, which boosts my mult and increases sell value, while Mail-in Rebate gives me chips. Photograph offers double mult on the first face card, and Hanging Chad can retrigger. There's some interesting synergy with these upgrades!\n**Evaluating card mechanics**\n\nI'm analyzing how the Hanging Chad works, which retriggers the first card used in scoring up to two additional times, making it score three times total. I think the Photograph will likely apply each time since it says \"when scored.\" So if I retrigger, that should mean a multiplier effect, like x2 each time, which could lead to a huge boost if it multiplies (x2^3 = 8). Sixth Sense could give me a spectral card if my first play is a single 6, which sounds powerful but relies on specific conditions. I can create consumables with it, but do I need that joker? The other jokers in the shop seem weaker, so this might be worth it!\n**Weighing deck improvements**\n\nI’m thinking it might be better to save some money for now. I could buy a Standard Pack for $4 to potentially strengthen my deck. However, it adds a new playing card, which might not help much, although it could include an enhanced card. It might help to add more hearts or face cards for that Photograph synergy or even a 6 for Sixth Sense. Still, it reduces my chance of drawing key cards. With $26, maybe I should consider rerolling for a better joker or consumable instead. The reroll costs $3, but I might want to conserve my funds for later, especially since we’re gearing up for a boss battle soon!\n**Preparing for the boss battle**\n\nI haven't seen the boss effect yet, but I will during the blind select. I’m thinking that rerolling in the shop could get me some useful planet cards for leveling up my flush or tarot cards to modify my deck. Right now, there are no consumables available, but I can spend some of my $26 on rerolls. I need to evaluate our current scoring: we have a flush level 4 with a base of 80 chips and a x10 multiplier. With my Gift Card adding +20 mult, Photograph providing x2, and Hanging Chad retriggering, there's potential for a huge multiplier. I just need to make sure my first scored card is a face card in my scoring hand!\n**Deciding on the next steps**\n\nIt looks like I could have a huge base multiplier of 34 if I combine certain cards, making boss fights easier. However, to create spectral cards with Sixth Sense, I need to play a single 6 first, which could complicate things during a boss round when I might need every hand. Since there are no consumables available in the shop, rerolling for a planet or tarot card feels like the best move. Even though I spent $4 on a spectral pack already, a $4 standard pack might add useful cards, although I’m unsure of the enhancements. \n\nBefore the boss, I should be mindful of our money and interest. I think it will be best to reroll the shop now and see what’s available!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
