{"reasoning":"**Calculating final setup**\n\nAlright, it looks like I'm preparing for the final boss round after possibly beating the previous one! I need to optimize my setup with the strongest options. I currently have jokers like Pareidolia and Smiley, but I need a fifth one from the shop, which has some interesting choices. I think I can replace a sold Bull with the Blue Joker, which could add some chips based on my calculations, totaling around 160 chips. I just need to confirm those details!\n**Assessing card options**\n\nThe Blue Joker seems like a solid choice, possibly better than the Bull at 138. However, I need to consider the $7 cost and whether I really want the Tarot Merchant for rerolls—maybe that's unnecessary right now since beating the final boss is my main goal. The Blue Joker boosts chips per hand, while the Idol could significantly improve my multiplier if I manage to play the 5 of Hearts, but that card changes every round. It’s crucial for my strategy to have the right cards in play!\n**Planning flush strategy**\n\nWe can play flushes, potentially including the 5 of Hearts if we go for a hearts flush or use wild cards. However, without knowing the deck's composition, our flush could be of any suit. Building a hearts flush might be tough since I need enough hearts, but I can utilize discards. With the Hanged Man and Magician tarot cards, I can boost my chances. The Idol offers a two-times multiplier when scored, which could stack with Photograph and Chad for a significant multiplier effect if everything aligns!\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nThe Photograph triggers a two-times multiplier on the first played face card when scored, and with Pareidolia, the 5 of Hearts counts as a face card. I think it's logical that if the 5 is the first one played, Photo would trigger then. This multiplier might apply to each time it scores; so if the 5 triggers again, that could stack for some serious multipliers! If everything goes well, I could see an x64 multiplier on my flush, which would significantly boost my score against the boss! But if I can’t include that card, then the Idol's effect would be wasted.\n**Deciding between Blue Joker and Idol**\n\nOkay, the Blue Joker looks solid for stability, accumulating chips per hand, but I’m not sure how effective it’ll be against the final boss. With limited hands, I might only have four or five, and discarding could offset my gains. The Idol, however, multiplies scores and might be invaluable if the boss requires a massive amount—around 300k it seems! \n\nIf I can leverage the Idol with my flush strategy and connect with face cards, I might reach the required score easier. But will I reliably trigger it? There are big potential multipliers here, and while Blue contributes consistent chips, the Idol might be my best bet if I’m aiming high!\n**Choosing the best card strategy**\n\nI need to make a hearts flush with 5 hearts as my first scoring card. It’s beneficial to aim for the Idol for that multiplier potential, but I have to consider the boss requirement, which might be as high as 300k. We need cumulative scores across multiple hands—possibly around four.\n\nIf I buy Blue for stability now, I could reroll for extra multipliers, but I’m worried about missing the opportunity later. It seems safer to invest in the Idol for its synergy with my existing jokers. I believe this will enhance my strategy moving forward, so I'll go ahead and buy the Idol!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
