{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm figuring out the scoring mechanics for the card game. It seems that for a pair, only two cards score, while a \"stone\" card wouldn't count. The high card only gives one score point, so if the stone card is the highest, it might add 50 points, but since it lacks rank and suit, it's unclear if it can be considered high. Tower seems to have low value. I think investing in booster packs for better cards could be smarter. Plus, using the Wraith consumable could lead to complications regarding my current joker capacity.\n**Evaluating card strategy and options**\n\nI'm looking at my card options, where it states that using Wraith creates a random Rare Joker but resets my money to zero. Since I'm at 5/5 jokers, I could sell one, but which is the weakest? It seems Pareidolia is essential with Smiley and Photograph, while Chad holds strength. The Gift Card boosts sell values, but I wonder if Wraith might give a better rare. Alternatively, I could buy a Jumbo Standard pack to enhance my deck or reroll the shop for better jokers. Rerolling costs $3, but I should keep some money for interest unless I decide to use Wraith first.\n**Deciding on consumable usage**\n\nI’m considering whether to use Wraith now or save it for later since it takes up a consumable slot. Using it later might be smarter when I have more money to spend. However, keeping Wraith means I can’t pick up other consumables because of the two-slot limit. I already have Justice, which needs target cards. Selling Wraith could free up a slot, but it’s strong. Given my options at the shop, buying booster packs to enhance my cards seems like the best route, allowing me to spend my $13 wisely.\n**Planning shop actions**\n\nI’m considering another approach: rerolling the shop first to find better jokers, especially since I have synergy. However, my max joker count means I can't buy new ones unless I replace Gift. I could also purchase a booster to get valuable cards like Glass or Steel. Buying the Jumbo Standard pack seems sensible because of its high value. I plan to buy it for $6, which will leave me with $7. After that, I’ll select a card and might think about getting a Standard pack or rerolling. First step: buy the Jumbo Standard pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
