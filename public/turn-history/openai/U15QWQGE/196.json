{"reasoning":"**Planning strategy for Ante 8**\n\nI'm currently at the shop for Ante 8 after defeating the Ante 7 boss. Now I need to strengthen my build for the upcoming challenges. My current setup relies on face card synergy: with Pareidolia enhancing face cards to Smiley for multiplier bonuses, and Hanging Chad able to retrigger plays. My main goal is to gather more chips and scaling multipliers.\n\nOptions include Ice Cream for chips, Midas Mask, and Magician tarot cards, but I need to evaluate selling a joker to afford a new one.\n**Evaluating Ice Cream as a joker**\n\nI realized that Ice Cream is a joker giving a strong immediate boost of +100 chips, but it decays by -5 for every hand played. This is great since we're nearing the end of our run, needing to beat Ante 8's blinds. \n\nSince the decay happens per hand rather than per round, I think I can manage by playing minimally, ideally just one hand per blind. So even with the decay, Ice Cream should still provide solid value!\n**Assessing Midas Mask**\n\nThe Midas Mask is a joker that transforms all played face cards into Gold cards when scored. Plus, it gives an additional $3 if you hold it at the end of the round. This works great with Pareidolia because it means all cards become face cards, leading to a lot of enhancements. \n\nWhile I’m nearing the end of my run, having this ability could help boost my economy for more jokers or packs. But I need to remember that it doesn't directly improve chip scoring, just adds a bit of cash.\n**Considering options for scaling items**\n\nI see potential in buying scaling items, like the Magician tarot, which can make two cards lucky, adding a solid multiplier and cash boost through our current lucky cards. With Hanging Chad, the retrigged first card could trigger that multiplier multiple times. The downside is I can't target right now since I'm in the shop phase without a hand. \n\nI can buy the Magician as a consumable for $3 and use it later. The Sly Joker could also give me some extra chips if I have a pair, which might add some value to my strategy.\n**Deciding on next purchases**\n\nWe're considering the best way to improve our flush setup since our main hand type is a flush, which can include a pair. The Sly Joker offers +50 chips if there's a pair, but that might not be enough compared to our high multipliers.\n\nI’m weighing whether to sacrifice some jokers for new options, but most are crucial for my build. Instead, buying a Celestial Pack to potentially upgrade my flush seems smart, along with possibly acquiring the Magician tarot for its benefits. Getting +100 chips from Ice Cream could also add value since it boosts our chip total before multipliers, which is significant! Let's go with buying the Celestial Pack first.\n**Strategizing for the next moves**\n\nI’m weighing whether to swap out one of my existing jokers for Ice Cream, but I'll lose some multipliers if I do. The ideal scenario is maximizing my flush and overall scoring potential. I need to consider how much I would gain from Ice Cream compared to what I'd lose if I drop a joker.\n\nBuying the Celestial Pack to get a potential planet like Jupiter to boost my flush seems like an essential move. I still have some funds left, so let’s prioritize that. I’ll go ahead with the buy_booster action for the Celestial Pack.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
