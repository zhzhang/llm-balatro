{"reasoning":"**Considering purchases and interest**\n\nI can buy it for $5, which seems like a good additive multiplier since each scored heart gives a +3 multiplier. For a 5-card hand with maybe 3 hearts, that’s +9, but I’d prefer a three-of-a-kind or full house. Since it’s cheap and slot-free, I think buying it is a good move.\n\nHowever, if I consider vouchers, a reroll surplus of $10 could help in future shops. With $25, I can buy a voucher and still have $15 left. But I might wonder if buying too much now could reduce interest later.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI should consider buying value items early. My thought is to buy a voucher to reduce the reroll to 3, allowing for more value later. It’s also a good idea to grab a celestial pack for leveling up a hand type, probably a Three of a Kind or Full House, for only $4. Upgrading that base multiplier, especially with jokers, could be beneficial. \n\nThe spectral pack has powerful effects but comes with risks, creating both positives and negatives. Since packs yield immediate consumables, we need to choose our next action carefully, perhaps prioritizing the voucher or celestial pack first.\n**Considering shop purchases**\n\nI think there’s likely a limited shop option. If I buy a booster, I can choose a card, but that might complicate things, considering previous tasks where purchasing a booster leads to a selection state. \n\nOrdering is important: I could buy a Gift Card first to increase sell value at the end of the round. Buying new jokers before the next round would yield higher value too. So, my next action will be to buy the voucher Reroll Surplus since it’s a solid long-term choice and doesn’t require a follow-up selection. After that, I can buy a celestial pack later. However, the voucher might be unnecessary if I don’t reroll often, but it’s cheap.\n**Analyzing Photograph and face cards**\n\nIt seems like Photograph could be affected if the boss debuffs all face cards. That might make it less effective since Photograph typically triggers on the first played face card. But if face cards are debuffed, they still exist as face cards; however, their abilities and chip value would be nullified.\n\nPhotograph is a joker, so it should still trigger when a face card is played, even if it's debuffed, resulting in a x2 multiplier. I need to arrange my jokers strategically because the order matters; Photograph triggers “when scored” based on the left-to-right sequence of played cards.\n**Optimizing card order and purchases**\n\nTo maximize gains, I think Photograph should be placed before other 'on scored' cards because it gives a x2 multiplier when the first face card is scored. The Gift Card provides a +10 multiplier and might be applied later, while the mail-in rebate gives an additional 50 chips.\n\nI need to ensure that the +mult effects are triggered before the xmult triggers for maximum efficiency. So I’d want Lusty and others to activate before Photograph. If I buy Lusty, it could add +3 for scored hearts, and then Photograph would double that for the first face card. \n\nArranging the order is key, but purchasing the voucher seems like a safe choice, so I’ll buy voucher 1 now.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
