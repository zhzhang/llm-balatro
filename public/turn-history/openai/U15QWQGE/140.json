{"reasoning":"**Deciding on actions**\n\nI’m considering the best immediate action. My first thought is to sell Stuntman to buy Lusty Joker, but I can only make one move per turn. Selling Stuntman would let me buy later, but I wonder if Empress might be a better choice since it can improve my deck. Selling Lovers crossed my mind, but it's strong with Sun synergy. I’d like to keep Sun, aiming for the hearts deck, so I’ll need to juggle these decisions wisely!\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about the benefits of Acrobat, which provides a x3 final hand, versus Card Sharp, which offers a conditional x3. Acrobat's benefits are unconditional but limited to the final hand. I’m contemplating replacing Stuntman with Lusty Joker for better synergy with Sun since it converts key ranks into hearts, boosting my scoring. Each heart could add substantial multipliers. There’s also the option of Reserved Parking, which gives money based on held face cards. I have to weigh these choices carefully!\n**Analyzing my options**\n\nI realize we have $20, so I could sell Stuntman for $3 and buy a joker to open up space. That seems like a safe plan, but I’m wondering if Stuntman is really the weakest link. Card Sharp’s synergy requires playing the same hand type multiple times, but if I win with one big hand, it won't trigger. I could set up a smaller hand first, then repeat a larger pair, though I can't repeat the same hand. Acrobat might allow for a single-hand win, as long as I use it in the last round.\n**Evaluating hand choices**\n\nI realize that the final hand means the last hand remaining, and I could play low hands strategically to control the outcome. This approach is risky because of the blind target. Lusty Joker offers additive multipliers, but I’m considering if that’s lesser than the flat chips from Stuntman. Stuntman provides +250 chips, which is multiplied by our main multipliers—this could be quite powerful! I’m leaning toward keeping Stuntman for that consistency, even with a -2 hand size penalty. If I keep him, I have to decide carefully about acquiring a new joker.\n**Analyzing joker options**\n\nI’m reviewing the available jokers: Photograph offers strong multipliers, especially with Pareidolia making each card a face card. Hanging Chad allows for retriggering, enhancing synergy with multipliers. There's Stuntman bringing in +250 chips, though it reduces hand size. Card Sharp offers potential x3 multipliers, but it’s highly situational. I need to decide whether to invest in Acrobat for consistent scoring or go for Empress for permanent upgrades. Empress seems very powerful, but I need to make space for it, likely selling something. Should I prioritize that or hold off for now?\n**Weighing joker trade-offs**\n\nI think I need to examine my options with the jokers and chips. Acrobat seems tempting as it could multiply my final hand, but I’d have to give up Stuntman or Card Sharp. Stuntman offers +250 chips which is a solid boost, while Acrobat would only be active for the final hand. Lusty offers additive multipliers, which could enhance my score significantly. However, I must decide what to prioritize—keeping Stuntman for its chip boost or investing in Empress for long-term improvements. I'll sell something to make space for a new purchase!\n**Deciding on consumables**\n\nI’m considering my options with The Lovers and The Sun. The Lovers is a wild card that's useful for flushes and straight flushes, and it enhances cards into wilds permanently. Meanwhile, The Sun allows for deck conversion to hearts, which is helpful too. Ultimately, I think keeping The Lovers is better, so I'll sell The Sun for $1. My next move is to use that to buy the Empress, enhancing my deck's potential significantly! I'll sell the Sun now!\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
