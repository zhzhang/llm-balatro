{"reasoning":"**Evaluating gaming strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to skip big for the handy tag, which gives $7 instantly. But, I can't skip the boss, and I’d lose the opportunity to gain $4 and access to the shop if I skip. It seems better to play big to improve before facing the boss. Maybe I could skip small to get an uncommon tag, then play big to have a shop. Skipping doesn't consume hands, so that could be optimal. We're currently at max jokers, though!\n**Analyzing shop strategies**\n\nTo get a free uncommon, I need to sell something unless it's a negative edition. The Gift Card boosts sell values, so it's better to sell later. To claim a free Joker, I’ll need an open slot; maybe I can sell a Trading Card or Mail-In Rebate later on. Trading Cards provide $3 per round, while the Mail-In Rebate offers +50 chips and varying cash based on discard rank. I think we can skip small for better scoring, but losing access to the shop before the boss might be costly!\n**Considering shop vs. uncommon**\n\nThe tag gives a free uncommon, which could potentially make missing a shop less impactful. Actually, we still have a shop after the big and boss; we only miss one after the small. If the uncommon is strong, that might be acceptable. However, skipping the small means I lose the $3 reward and any money from leftover hands, which could affect scaling. Since ante 3 is relatively easy, playing the small for the extra shop and reward seems like a better choice! More shops could lead to better items!\n**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nSkipping for the uncommon ensures I get at least one for free in the shop, unlike the extra shop, which could be random but cost money. In the early game, having more shops is valuable. However, since I have a strong combo, it might be better to skip to snowball with the free uncommon. I’m leaning towards skipping the small round and will initiate that action. I might also want to rearrange my jokers, and there's a command for that! As for Photograph and Chad interactions, I learned that Photograph can double the score for the first played face card, which is excellent!\n**Analyzing joker placement**\n\nThe order of on-scored jokers is important, especially for triggers like Photograph and Chad. I think Photograph should ideally be placed to the left of others, but I don't have those yet. Chad is a retriggering joker, and it might activate after the first scoring. It’s crucial to consider how joker placements affect each other's abilities, but since Gift Card’s bonus is independent of the multipliers, it doesn’t affect how Photograph works. Thus, the order isn’t crucial, so I’ll go ahead and skip!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
