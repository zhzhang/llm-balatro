{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm assessing my options with low funds at $1. Winning could boost me to $4+, which might be necessary for shopping. Our build looks strong, and I think I can easily clear 30k. It seems better to play big for earning money and hitting the shop before the boss, while also seeking improvements or tarot/planets. I need to rearrange jokers in the blind select phase, as the order might affect scoring. Basically, I want to trigger Photograph effectively, and ensure Hanging Chad works correctly!\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm realizing that for category 3 on scored Jokers, they trigger when a card scores, likely in the same stage as Photograph and Bloodstone. If I order them as Photograph, then Chad, the first scored card will trigger Photograph twice, and then Chad may cause retriggers—though I'm uncertain about the specifics. In Balatro, retriggering is part of the scoring, and Hanging Chad seems to be a retriggering Joker that activates after other scored jokers. However, I'm still figuring out how the order influences things!\n**Analyzing card scoring**\n\nI've got the prompt down: cards score from left to right, triggering base chips, modifiers, and 'on scored' jokers in that order. Retriggers follow, starting with the red seal and then retriggering jokers from left to right. This suggests that retriggering jokers are in a separate stage and activated in that sequence. Since Chad seems to be part of the retrigger stage and Photograph and Bloodstone in the on scored stage, the order between them doesn’t matter. I’ll just play the round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
