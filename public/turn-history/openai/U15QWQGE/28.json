{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI'm at the shop after selecting Sigil from the spectral pack. I realize Sigil is a consumable meant to be used right away; it randomly converts all cards in my hand. It seems it didn't show as consumed or update my hand, so maybe it was applied during selection. I have no cards left to buy, and can't reroll. My best move is to reorder my jokers for better scoring. I’ll place Lusty before Photograph since it optimizes my scoring options.\n**Optimizing card order**\n\nTo maximize the scoring for face card hearts, I should apply Lusty before Photograph to enhance the multiplier effect. I’ll place Lusty to the left of Photograph. The order of the other cards doesn’t seem critical, but for clarity, maybe I should start with Trading Card as it triggers on discard. Gift Card, which gives +10 multiplier, still feels important but maybe not at the very front. \n\nI think I should settle on this order: Lusty, Photograph, Gift Card, Mail-In Rebate, and Trading Card for better clarity and effectiveness.\n**Refining card order strategy**\n\nI realized that Photograph and Lusty are both on-scored, so they trigger earlier in the scoring process, while Gift Card contributes after that. Since Mail-in Rebate adds chips independently, it likely doesn’t affect the multipliers directly. The order for maximizing scores should keep Lusty before Photograph. \n\nI’m considering the new order indices as [5,4,1,2,3] to move Lusty first. However, since Trading Card doesn’t impact this, I’ll make sure to finalize the order while keeping Gift Card relatively early, just in case there's any interaction later!\n**Finalizing card order**\n\nThe simplest way to optimize my card ordering is to swap positions 4 and 5, resulting in the new order: [1,2,3,5,4]. This places Gift Card, Mail-in Rebate, Trading Card, Lusty, and Photograph in the ideal sequence for scoring. \n\nFor my next action, I think it makes sense to rearrange the jokers now since it’s free and boosts my scoring potential. So, I’ll proceed with rearranging the jokers to [1,2,3,5,4].\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,5,4]"}
