{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop options**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop right before the final boss. I already sold Smiley and have 4 jokers now. The shop offers Ancient Joker, Shoot the Moon, Fortune Teller, and The Star consumable. Since I have 2 consumables already, I can't buy The Star without using or selling a card. \n\nThe Ancient Joker seems really powerful for scoring, especially since Sock and Pareidolia will make all played cards face, allowing for retriggers. With the Ancient Joker, each Heart card gives a x1.5 multiplier, which makes for great scoring potential!\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m trying to figure out the total scoring events for my first card. It seems like it scores 1 point, plus 1 from Sock, and 2 from Chad, but Sock retriggers all played face cards once when they score. \n\nSo it goes like this: First, the base scoring happens, then Sock and Chad retrigger the first played card two more times. The order of playing cards is important since jokers and retriggers activate from left to right. The current order of jokers is Pareidolia, Photograph, Chad, and Sock.\n**Assessing card scoring interactions**\n\nI think each time a card scores, it probably triggers again since it’s still considered the first played face card. The Ancient Joker is an on-scored joker, as it gives a x1.5 multiplier when a Heart card scores. The order of jokers matters for on-scored effects, and I’m wondering if I should place Photograph after any additive scores, but it seems there isn't any yet. \n\nThe interaction between Ancient and Photograph is interesting, as Ancient gives a 1.5 multiplier while Photograph gives a 2 for the first card. If I get Fortune Teller’s +15 additive, I might want to position it before the multipliers since it works independently after scoring.\n**Evaluating card purchases**\n\nIt seems like additive multipliers would be applied after the ones from Photograph and Ancient, which isn’t ideal since I could have had Smiley on score. I’m wondering if it’s worth buying Fortune Teller, as the +15 additive later might not compare with the larger multipliers. \n\nSince I’ve got a free slot, I think I’ll buy Ancient for $8. For Shoot the Moon, I need Queens in hand, and with Pareidolia, all cards are face, but I might still be short. Fortune Teller could be useful since I have a slot—maybe I’ll go for both since I can afford it! However, I need to consider how my build, which focuses on flush scoring, interacts with the final multipliers.\n**Calculating Ancient Joker's value**\n\nWow, with the Ancient Joker, the multiplier can get huge! Starting from a base of 10, each scoring event for Hearts—around 12 events—could multiply by 1.5, which comes out to about 129.7. If I combine that with Photograph's 2x, I could potentially hit around 20,752. Adding +15 from Fortune Teller seems negligible compared to that.\n\nI should consider rerolling the shop after buying Ancient, but I’ll risk losing other purchase opportunities. Although Pareidolia helps with retriggers, I realize I need to keep it since it makes all cards face. I think my best move is to just buy Ancient and adapt to a Hearts flush for the final boss. Let's do it!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
