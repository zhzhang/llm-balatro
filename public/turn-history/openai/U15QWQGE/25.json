{"reasoning":"**Evaluating investment strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to keep 5 or 10 for interest, maxing interest at 5 for $25. After the boss, I could have 25+, so spending now isn't a huge concern. Holding $10 now means I’d see just $2 interest after the boss, but I wonder how interest is calculated at the end of the round, including earnings. Since the tag might trigger after the boss, I’m unsure if interest counts then. Regardless, I'd likely end up with over $25, so power purchases might be the way to go!\n**Planning card purchases**\n\nI need to figure out the “appropriate action to take next.” My plan is to buy Lusty Joker first. After that, I’ll consider rearranging cards, like Photograph. But right now, the immediate action is to buy the card. I’ll use the command to purchase the card from the shop, which includes the jokers.  \n\nNow, regarding the joker order: I have Gift Card, Mail-In Rebate, Trading Card, and Photograph. I realize I need to place Photograph after additive multipliers like Lusty to maximize scoring—this means Lusty should come before Photograph for the best outcome.\n**Analyzing joker effects**\n\nI’m considering the effects of other on-scored jokers. The Mail-in Rebate is passive and adds +50 chips independently. It seems like the Gift Card also offers a +10 multiplier independently. The Trading Card only works when discarded, while the only significant on-scored jokers are Lusty and Photograph. \n\nSo, the correct order should be Lusty first, followed by Photograph. Although independent effects aren't critical for scoring order, they still multiply afterwards. I realize Photograph's x2 will impact the multiplier before the independent +10, and that timing is crucial for maximizing results!\n**Confirming card purchase strategy**\n\nLusty adds to the score during scoring, which is great because it doubles if it’s on the same face card. That makes buying Lusty even more advantageous! With a level 2 three of a kind giving a base multiplier of 5, plus other card multipliers and Lusty's effect, I see how valuable this could be. \n\nAfter Photograph doubles the total, the Gift Card adds +10 afterward. So, clearly, the next step is to go ahead and buy the card!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
