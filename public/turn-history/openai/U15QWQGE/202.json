{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot strategies**\n\nI'm examining how tarot cards might help me create more hearts for Bloodstone. It looks like Star converts to Diamonds, which isn't helpful. Death can duplicate a card, letting me copy a Heart to make more, but I require targets to buy and use it. I can buy it as a consumable, but we need funds. Selling the Magician nets me just $1, and I'd need to consider selling a joker to afford it. Bloodstone seems vital since it enhances heart cards by random multipliers.\n**Assessing strategy for hearts**\n\nI’m wondering if I can reliably play hearts with an unknown deck and a flush level of 4. My scoring seems to come from Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, and Chad, which is predictable. Bloodstone provides a boost but isn’t essential. I could sell Smiley for $2, totaling $3, to buy Death while keeping Bloodstone, but losing Smiley could be a significant hit. It’s key to my setup. Selling Bloodstone may not bring enough benefit, and using Death to duplicate core cards could help establish more hearts or stronger cards.\n**Considering power card strategies**\n\nLucky provides a multiplier that boosts scores but keeping Bloodstone might be more beneficial for my overall build. Death could create duplicates and help achieve five-of-a-kind hands, though my chances for that are low. Still, I could score well with multipliers if I manage the deck correctly, which is a challenge.\n\nThe Star converts three cards to diamonds, but that’s only useful if I'm aiming for a diamond flush, and I'm unsure what the upcoming boss is. Vagabond is rare and could create a Tarot card if I play with $4 or less, which could work if I keep my costs low.\n**Evaluating game options**\n\nI can't afford to sell a big joker for $8 since it’s not worth it. Looking at Supernova, if we frequently play Flush, it gives us a +6 multiplier, but that doesn’t scale much. With only $1, I can’t buy anything right now. I think it's better to save that money for interest, which earns $1 per $5. Ending the round gives $1 for unused hands, so I should avoid selling jokers. Selling the Magician doesn’t yield enough, and rerolling costs too much, so I’ll stick to round_select for now.\n**Deciding on round selection strategy**\n\nI'm considering whether to keep the Magician to enhance Lucky cards during rounds, which could boost multipliers and money. Using it on hearts against the final boss could yield significant rewards, especially with Lucky cards that can add +20 multipliers.\n\nSince I want to optimize jokers, the scoring order is important. Smiley should trigger first for additive benefits, followed by Photograph and Bloodstone for their multipliers. With everything considered, I won't take any actions now and will choose the round_select option instead. I'll format this as required.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
