{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop purchases**\n\nWe're in the shop with four jokers after selling Mystic, and we plan to buy Swash, which gives a +33 multiplier based on the values of other jokers: Photograph (10), Chad (9), Pareidolia (6), and Ancient (8). The cost is $4, and since we have plenty of money, it seems like a good buy. There’s also the option of Chaos for a free reroll, but we’re close to maxing slots. Swash likely offers the best multiplier and synergy. I realize Saturn is a planet card that can also be bought and used!\n**Considering card purchases**\n\nI need to decide on card purchases, specifically using the `buy_card` command for regular cards and `buy_and_use_consumable` for consumable types. Since Saturn is a planet, it qualifies as consumable and can be bought and used directly. Buying it would level Straight up from level 1 to level 2, providing +30 chips and +3 multiplier base. However, I should prioritize buying Swash first, as it uses a joker slot. After that, we can consider Saturn! I'll proceed with the buy_card action.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
