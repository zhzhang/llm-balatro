{"reasoning":"**Calculating scoring strategy**\n\nI need to aim for 3-4k in points with my boss. My jokers give a +10 multiplier, and my hand’s base multiplier should work alongside other bonuses. The economy looks stable with $12, and I have some additional cards, but I might not need the Egg. \n\nEstimating hand scoring: a full house starts with base chips at 65 and a base multiplier of 6. It seems like cards contribute to this based on their rank. I need to check that!\n**Estimating final multiplier and chips**\n\nMy final multiplier might be calculated as (base multiplier of 6 + 10 from the gift + hearts bonus, possibly another 6) times 2. So, if I add it up, it could be (6 + 10 + 9 = 25) and then multiply by 2 for 50.  \n\nThe chip total looks to be around 155, including base chips of 65, other contributions of 40, and the Mail-in bonus. This gives me a total of 7750, which feels strong! I need to keep in mind the importance of face cards to trigger bonuses while considering my overall strategy.\n**Weighing options for cards and economy**\n\nI have $12 and possibly $2 interest at the end, which makes me consider other options. The Standard pack seems like a good add for deck improvement, but it's random. I wonder if the Egg could replace the Trading Card for economy since it increases the sell value by $4 each round.  \n\nTrading generates $3 per round if I can discard a card, which isn't always guaranteed. While Mail-in gives a solid +50 chips, it’s inconsistent. I need to decide which is the weakest, but Trading has consistent potential.\n**Analyzing joker and economy options**\n\nI’m considering keeping one economy joker and one chip joker. The Egg could be worth it since we’re still early in the game, but utilizing a slot could be costly if I lose a scoring joker. \n\nI'm thinking about selling the Trading Card for the Egg since it gives immediate $5 but costs 4. However, it doesn’t provide per-round cash, only increased sell value. I'm also pondering the idea of using the Egg as a bank, but I need to remember that there's a $5 interest cap, so hoarding beyond 25 isn’t really beneficial.\n**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI think using the misprint for random multipliers might be decent, averaging around +11, but it could replace the Trading Card to improve my score. I could also buy the Standard pack, but it's not too exciting.  \n\nInstead, I could reroll the shop for potential stronger jokers or something like a tarot or planet that doesn't require a slot. The reroll costs 4, and since I have 12, I can manage a few but want to keep some for interest. Since we’re at the shop before the next round, I’m leaning towards rerolling to see what I can find!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
