{"reasoning":"**Exploring gameplay strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about how the multiplier gets applied. If I multiply by 2 three times, that equals x8, right? The Stuntman gives +250 chips but reduces hand size by 2. With an ante of 6, the chip requirements are high, but the Stuntman helps scale the chip base with xmult. Card Sharp offers a x3 multiplier for a hand already played this round, so maybe I can play a small hand first and then follow up with a bigger one.\n**Analyzing card multipliers**\n\nI'm looking at the Lusty Joker, which gives a +3 multiplier for each heart scored. With Pareidolia, suit doesn't matter, but I could convert cards to hearts using Sun—oh wait, I don’t have Sun anymore! Only the Lovers are wild cards now. I think the Lovers can be counted as any suit for flushes, but I'm not so sure about Lusty since it specifies hearts for the multiplier. \n\nOh, and Reserved Parking provides money for face cards in hand. With Pareidolia, all face cards are in play, so holding them gives me $1 each. But with Stuntman reducing hand size by 2, I've only got six cards left.\n**Evaluating hand strategies**\n\nI might have a base hand size of 8, but with Stuntman reducing it by 2, I'm down to 6. Can I hold onto one card for each hand played? There’s a chance to generate some money, but with an ante of 6, that’s less of a priority. I'm considering swapping Card Sharp or Stuntman for Acrobat. \n\nIf I use Card Sharp, I need to play the same hand type twice for it to trigger, which feels risky. Acrobat gives a consistent x3 multiplier on the final hand. But wait, the final hand means when there’s only one left in the round.\n**Clarifying scoring interactions**\n\nIt looks like the \"final hand of the round\" means when I'm down to my last available hand, granting a x3 multiplier. If I win before that, it won’t trigger, but I could play low hands to reach the final one and then go big. That sounds risky. My current setup is already strong, especially with Photograph x8 plus Stuntman chips and a base multiplier from a strong hand like Three of a Kind, giving 88 with the multiplier. \n\nIt's starting to look like I can beat the blinds without needing a new joker, but I still have to think about upcoming antes of 6 and 8.\nI'm weighing the pros and cons of keeping the economy but might consider dumping Stuntman due to the hand size penalty. While the chips are significant, the multipliers become more important at higher antes. Card Sharp can potentially give a x3 multiplier if I play the same hand type again, which seems easier than risking the final hand. \n\nWhile Reserved Parking could help, it may not be essential given our current funds. I could reroll for a better joker or consumable, but I'd need to sell something first. Planning for the next round, I want to maximize triggers and consider my joker order. It seems that using my jokers strategically might be the way to go!\nI'm considering the order of how to apply multipliers because it can greatly affect my scoring. For independent cards like Card Sharp and Photograph, the addition of chips and multipliers matters. I should apply any chip effects before multipliers for the best outcome.\n\nWhile I’m thinking about purchasing Reserved Parking or adjusting my jokers, keeping Stuntman could be important for chips. Also, I might want to reroll to find better options in the shop, although I need to be cautious about spending. Since we can use certain consumables during gameplay, that adds flexibility. For now, though, I think my best move is to proceed with the round select.\nI'm evaluating the synergy of my current deck setup, especially considering losing Stuntman and possibly trading Card Sharp for Acrobat. While Stuntman gives +250 chips, the multiplier from Acrobat on the final hand could potentially boost scoring significantly. \n\nIf I keep Card Sharp, I can aim for that x3 multiplier across multiple hands, but against bosses like \"The Needle,\" Acrobat might be more beneficial. Ultimately, I’m leaning towards replacing Stuntman with Acrobat, as it would maintain consistency in hand size while offering stronger multipliers for my final hand.\nI'm deciding on whether to sell Stuntman, which reduces my hand size by 2, potentially limiting my ability to create strong hands. Selling it could free up space and allow me to buy Acrobat, which helps with multipliers on the final hand. Although Stuntman contributes to all hands, our multipliers are already strong. If I sell Stuntman now for $3, I'll plan to buy Acrobat next turn for $6. This will leave me with enough money for future interest. So, I'll proceed to sell Stuntman.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
