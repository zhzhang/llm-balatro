{"reasoning":"**Considering shop purchases**\n\nI’m in the shop after beating the big blind, and I need to choose my purchases. I have $15 and four jokers, with one slot open. The shop has several options: Lusty Joker for $5, Celestial Pack for $4, Spectral for $4, and a reroll for $3 because of a voucher. I need to prepare for the boss, which will give me a nice investment return after defeating it. My current jokers have various advantages, so it's worth strategizing on how to best use them!\n**Maximizing scoring with jokers**\n\nI need to maximize my score by playing a face card for a full house with jacks, potentially. The order of my jokers matters during scoring, as triggers occur left-to-right by joker order. For the Photograph, it doubles the multiplier when the first face card scores, and I want that to follow the Lusty Joker's +3 multiplier on hearts. \n\nSo, I should get Lusty first to boost the score before Photograph triggers. Plus, the Celestial Pack could help level my hand type, but I'm focusing on forming a solid full house and three of a kind right now!\n**Considering purchases for power**\n\nThe Celestial pack offers random options, which can be valuable early on. The Spectral pack can provide powerful cards like Immolate but carries some risks. With $15, I could buy Lusty for $5, Celestial for $4, and Spectral for $4, totaling $13, leaving me with $2. However, interest is only earned at the end of rounds, and since we're going into the boss battle, that $2 won't help much. Maybe it's better to keep $10 for potential interest, or I might consider getting Lusty and Celestial while keeping $6 in reserve. Spending now might provide the power needed to survive the boss!\n**Analyzing boss effects and purchases**\n\nI’m not sure what the boss will be, maybe \"The Club,\" which could debuff hearts or face cards. Since Lusty Joker is tied to hearts, it might struggle against a boss that counters hearts, like The Head, which indeed debuffs hearts. There’s also The Plant for face cards later. It might be better to buy the Celestial pack first to see how it can improve my hand without affecting my decision too much. Buying that pack is a cheap way to get consistent upgrades, and then I can decide on either Lusty or Spectral based on what options I have after that.\n**Deciding on booster purchases**\n\nThe Celestial pack might give me a planet to pivot toward a hearts flush with Lusty, which encourages that strategy. I'm unsure about the deck's composition, but standard hearts should be good. I should also rearrange my jokers for optimal scoring order: Lusty first, then Photograph, followed by Gift Card and Mail-In Rebate. \n\nI need to ensure that additive multipliers trigger before Photograph to maximize scoring. For that reason, I'll definitely go for Lusty, even with potential risks in the Spectral pack. So my action will be to buy the Celestial Pack for better upgrades, and I'll output that as a JSON action!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
