{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop options**\n\nI’m considering the next actions in the shop before facing the final boss. We recently sold the Bloodstone, leaving us with 4 jokers and an open slot. We have options like Burglar, Shoot the Moon, Bull, and Mad Joker. For our flush build, we’re using Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, and Hanging Chad. Smiley adds a +5 multiplier for each face card, while Photograph could double multipliers based on the first played face card. It seems complicated, and I want to be sure I understand the mechanics correctly.\n**Considering boss strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about our strategy for facing the boss, especially in Ante 8. We currently have 75k chips and need to reliably beat a boss who might have between 150k and 200k. It seems like using Bull could be a solid option since it adds +2 chips per dollar. With my current total at $51, I’d gain around 102 chips for each hand. This could significantly boost our chip base from about 120 to 222, possibly increasing our score considerably!\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m analyzing the options for our strategy with the available cards. Burglar gives +3 hands but doesn’t allow discards, which could affect our ability to fish for hearts in a flush. While it may offer more money at the end, I feel we should prioritize discards for consistency. Bull seems like a better fit. Then there’s Shoot the Moon, which gives a +13 multiplier for each Queen we hold. However, it requires careful play to maximize its benefits. Mad Joker seems less relevant with its multipliers only kicking in with pairs.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI think buying Bull is the best immediate improvement for our strategy. I also need to consider the open joker slot, and selling isn't necessary since the cost is only $6. After the purchase, my funds will go down to $45, which will give me a +90 chip effect from Bull. However, it scales with current money, so I have to think about whether to buy now or wait until after the boss battle. I can't revisit the shop later if I win, so maybe it's best to buy Bull now. Should I also consider buying Shoot the Moon? I’ll have to choose wisely since I can only keep five jokers!\n**Determining card strategies**\n\nI’m leaning towards buying Bull as the best option. I also considered Tarot Merchant, which doubles tarots in the shop, but that seems pointless since there won’t be ante after the boss. Standard packs adding heart cards might waste money, and I can't use the Magician on cards in the shop. \n\nArranging joker order is crucial because independent effects apply left-to-right. I’ll want Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, and Hanging Chad in that specific order, with Bull at the end, since it doesn’t affect others. So, I’ll purchase Bull as my next action!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [3]"}
