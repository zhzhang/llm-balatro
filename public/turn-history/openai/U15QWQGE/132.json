{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m in the shop and I've sold an Ancient, so I have an empty joker slot now. I should buy the Stuntman, which costs 7, and I have 52. I’m wondering if I should consider the Hiker too, but there's only room for one more. While Hiker could be good for scaling, it might be too slow in the late game. Stuntman provides immediate chips. I’ll go ahead and buy Stuntman first. After that, I can think about rerolls.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
