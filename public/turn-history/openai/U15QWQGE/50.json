{"reasoning":"**Analyzing two pair scoring**\n\nI played two pair earlier and scored 1224. I want to calculate the expected score for two pair based on the first card and a chad. It seems like the Photograph feature might not trigger on retriggers, or perhaps the chad retriggers but Photograph only works once per hand.\n\nIn my earlier play, I had a two pair of 8s and 4s with a jack kicker, achieving that 1224 score. I need to backtrack to understand the scoring mechanics more clearly, focusing on the base chips and the multiplier effects.\n**Computing the multiplier**\n\nI'm wondering about the Mail-in rebate providing an extra 50 chips but possibly debuffed. I think the base multiplier is 2, with a Gift Card giving an additional 10, bringing it to 12 without other factors. So, 104 chips times 12 equals 1248, but since I actually scored 1224, there's a difference of 24.\n\nMaybe the chips were 102 instead of 104. It’s a bit uncertain whether the jack was destroyed by the glass card, impacting scoring. The glass card has a chance to destroy after scoring, and I need to clarify how Photograph interacts with the multipliers—possibly only applying once per hand.\n**Clarifying multiplier interactions**\n\nI'm pondering whether if the chad retriggers a card, it might also retrigger the Photograph. The Photograph seems to trigger when the first face card is scored, so if that card retriggers, maybe the Photograph wouldn’t activate again since it relies on the first-played face card.\n\nThe chad retriggers the first played card used in scoring two additional times, but this doesn't seem to work for on-scored jokers. It looks like the Photograph likely only triggers once, even with retriggers. The glass card gives a x2 multiplier when scored, but it might not stack in a way that creates enormous scores again.\n**Evaluating the retrigger mechanics**\n\nI'm considering whether the hanging chad retriggers base chips only from the card without affecting joker triggers. According to the rules, retriggers should repeat the entire sequence, including base chips and on-scored jokers, so I think it does matter.\n\nHowever, I'm confused about why my score of 1224 isn't higher. The Jack is part of the scoring hand, alongside two pairs of 8s and 4s. It could be that the scoring was debuffed. I'm also contemplating how the Photograph functions; it seems to double the multiplier, but only if it triggers again, which may not be the case here.\n**Strategizing for the flush**\n\nI'm aiming for a score of 1776, but it looks like I might need some larger chips or a better multiplier. Trying to make pairs or three of a kind doesn’t seem sufficient. However, I might have a shot with a flush of hearts. With 5 hearts, I could achieve a significant score, especially since the flush could pull in large multipliers and benefits from the Photograph.\n\nI should discard non-heart cards to increase my chance of drawing new hearts. I’m discarding specific positions while ensuring to keep my heart cards. I think this strategy could lead to a strong winning hand.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
