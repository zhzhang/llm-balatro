{"reasoning":"**Clarifying shop actions**\n\nI realize that once I leave the shop, I won't be able to return until after the round, so I need to secure any items I want before leaving. If I'm aiming for Lusty or Acrobat, I must buy them before I exit. Currently, I can only buy Empress or sell joker. It seems I can perform multiple actions over turns. I'll first buy Empress and then I might consider selling Card Sharp to get Acrobat later. The priority is to buy Empress now!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [4]"}
