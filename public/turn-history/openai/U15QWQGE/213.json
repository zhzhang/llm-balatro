{"reasoning":"**Estimating game strategy**\n\nI might be able to replace Bull or Smiley if I find a huge xMult, but the shop doesn't have one right now. Rerolling could yield a better joker since I have $82 to do multiple rerolls, even with $5 increments. Each reroll decreases Bull because it relies on money. It might be worth spending some money to improve my xMult. I need to calculate the score needed for the final boss; I think ante 8 boss usually requires around 400k?\n**Improving score strategy**\n\nMy current flush score is at 104k, which is too low. I realize that I need to make a significant improvement. The last flush I played at ante 8 big blind hit 104,110, just reaching the 100k threshold, but the boss is likely higher, maybe around 300k. I need to upgrade my game. Raising my multipliers or chips is one way, and finding xMult jokers like Dusk could help, but options are limited. I might also consider enhancing my hand type level with cards from the planet Jupiter to boost my base multipliers, but it might not be enough. Looking into adding glass cards for double multipliers or using special edition cards could be beneficial. The Magician can also increase luck, offering a chance for a +20 multiplier and $20. It's not a guarantee, but every little bit helps!\n**Rethinking card strategy**\n\nI’m considering using high-frequency cards, like suit-specific ones, but I can't select targets in my hand right now. The Hanged Man could help by removing low-value cards to enhance my chances of drawing better ones, but I'm not entirely sure about that. It might be more advantageous to reroll for cards from planet Jupiter or tarot cards like The Sun or The World to change suits, or use Strength. Since I have enough money, I can reroll many times and still keep some for bull chips. My Bull is currently at 164, and even if I spend 50, it would drop to 64, potentially reducing my chips by 100 and losing 36k from my 104k total. Finding a strong joker with x3 multipliers through rerolls is crucial, especially since my money increased to 82 after buying Temperance!\n**Strategizing purchases**\n\nI need to be careful about spending down to zero because then my bull would be worthless. However, I could consider replacing bull with something better. Since there aren't any jokers with xMult in the shop right now, rerolling seems like the way to go. Alternatively, I could buy a voucher for the Tarot Merchant to increase tarot frequency in rerolls, but that won't help with finding jokers. Focus should probably be on rerolls to seek better jokers, but since rerolls also affect jokers, that could be tricky. Maybe I should prioritize buying Standard Packs first, as they can add strong playing cards without needing rerolls.\n**Planning card purchases and strategy**\n\nI have two standard packs that cost 4 each, totaling 8, which is negligible. I could buy both, and boosters will let me choose one of three playing cards, possibly yielding enhanced or edition cards. Since I need a significant boost, I'm considering glass cards or polychrome options. My current focus should be buying booster packs before rerolls because the cost of rerolls will increase. I'm also debating whether to invest in Sly Joker, which gives +50 chips if I have a Pair. However, since my flush could contain a pair, I can still get the bonus. Ultimately, I need to prioritize strategies that maximize my score while keeping an eye on how jokers and other cards interplay.\n**Deciding on joker order and purchases**\n\nI’m thinking about the positioning of independent jokers and xMult cards, like Blueprint. Since Bull is at position 5, it adds chips before final multiplication. I’m realizing that the order isn't too crucial for independent jokers, so reordering Bull isn’t necessary. Instead, my action will be to buy one booster pack (standard pack) and see what options I get to choose from. Let’s go ahead and do that!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
