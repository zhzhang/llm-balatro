{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop purchases**\n\nI'm in the shop, figuring out my purchases around round 5. We have full jokers and the current shop offers include Oops All 6s, Zany Joker, The World tarot, and Even Steven. I already bought an Arcana pack and have filled Wraith and Justice consumables, with $20 left. My plan revolves around using Photograph and Hanging Chad to retrigger scoring cards for multipliers. It looks like I can stack multipliers for some great scoring potential. So, I need to prioritize getting a face card.\n**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nJustice can double the multiplier for a Glass card, but there's a risk—1 in 4 chance it could be destroyed. Scoring three times increases that risk, yet the reward could be massive since Glass also has a multiplier and retriggers increase it each time. Combining it with Photograph could yield huge scores. However, right now, I can't use consumables since I'm in the shop phase. The World tarot might help with a spade flush, but I can't buy it without selling another card like Wraith or Justice.\n**Evaluating card value**\n\nI’m weighing whether The World is more valuable than Wraith. Wraith creates a random rare joker but sets my money to $0. My economy is okay right now, but I might want a better joker later on. If I sell a joker, I'll wipe my funds. Actually, since it sets money to zero, Wraith is better used at the end of the shop phase. Plus, Justice is also good. Oops All 6s could improve chances for Lucky and Glass, but it doubles the destroy chance for Glass as well, which may not be ideal.\n**Reviewing card multipliers**\n\nLucky's +20 multiplier with a 1 in 5 chance that becomes 2 in 5 means a 40% boost, which is good, but I don't have any Lucky cards right now. There’s also Wraith, which may yield rare jokers, but its odds aren't even rare. Oops All 6s might not help my strategy and could actually hurt if I use Glass. Even Steven provides a +4 multiplier for each even-ranked card scored, but since we focus on face cards like J, Q, and K, I need to be strategic about scoring. If the Queen is my first scoring card, each score could add up nicely!\n**Deciding on shop strategies**\n\nThe Stuntman reduces my hand size by 2, which I've already got. I'm considering whether to replace Mail-In Rebate or Stuntman with Even Steven. While Stuntman gives a significant chip boost, Mail-In Rebate adds chips and depends on rank discards. Even Steven provides additive multipliers, which could really boost my scores. If I play an even face card like Queen first, I could add substantial multipliers during scoring. However, I might want to reroll for better jokers or tarot cards to enhance my strategy since I’m full on jokers right now.\n**Analyzing shop options**\n\nI need to decide on my next moves. If I use buy_and_use immediately, it might not require storage space. For a planet like Mercury, there may be no targets needed, which could work even at max capacity. I should look at rearranging my jokers to maximize scoring, placing Photograph strategically. My current goal is to reroll the shop to find more valuable planet cards or better jokers than Mail-In Rebate. I’ll also keep an eye on my money to maintain interest while spending wisely. Rerolling seems most impactful now.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
