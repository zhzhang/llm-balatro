{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card mechanics**\n\nI’m breaking down the mechanics of three game components.  \n\nFor Photograph, I’m considering how it earns multipliers by triggering each time with the first card scored, which could lead to significant scoring. I think it’s a solid choice to keep.  \n\nHanging Chad also seems essential since it allows retriggers on the first card, enhancing synergy with other cards.  \n\nAs for Pareidolia, it helps with Photograph but might not be necessary if I can consistently play face cards first.\n**Analyzing card synergies**\n\nHmm, I’m thinking about the deck strategy regarding face cards. If I drop certain cards, consistency might take a hit.  \n\nThe Gift Card holo offers a +10 multiplier and increases sell values every round, which is good. But with Swashbuckler in play, it adds the sell value of other jokers to the multiplier. Right now, that gives me +46 from the various cards. However, if I replace one for Swashbuckler, the total multiplier can change significantly, depending on what I drop. I need to measure the impacts carefully!\n**Evaluating card replacements**\n\nI'm weighing card replacements. If I swap Ancient, Swashbuckler gives a multiplier of 38, but I'd lose x1.5 per suit, which is a big hit. If I replace Chad, it’s 37, but I’d lose retriggers. \n\nIt seems replacing Pareidolia with Swash could work, but is Pareidolia essential? I can try to ensure the first played card is a face card, but that’s not always guaranteed. \n\nMaybe keeping Pareidolia and swapping the Gift Card is a possibility, but then I’ll miss out on the stability that +10 multiplier offers. I need to keep balancing everything carefully!\n**Reassessing card strategies**\n\nOh, I've realized that the Gift Card actually boosts the sell value of all jokers, which benefits Swashbuckler since it relies on those sell values for scaling! If I remove the Gift Card, Swash wouldn't scale properly. It feels like keeping both Gift and Swash while dropping Pareidolia makes the most sense.  \n\nThe Gift Card adds $1 to every joker and consumable at the end of the round, which enhances their overall sell values. Swash will then get even better with this synergy. \n\nI should also think about adding Chaos the Clown, who provides free rerolls, but he costs $4 and takes up a joker slot. So, maybe it’s worth considering a swap!\n**Weighing card options**\n\nI'm analyzing my options for improving the deck while considering slots carefully. Sure, I can reroll with $60 and a $3 cost, but that won't save me much over the remaining antes. So, scoring is my main focus.  \n\nI discovered that buying the Blank voucher is key because it can upgrade to Antimatter later, allowing an extra joker slot. Since Antimatter opens up more strategies, I think it’s a wise $10 investment. \n\nI also need to consider the Saturn planet card for its potential boost, but I focus on straight builds, so it might not be essential. \n\nThen there's The Lovers tarot card; it could turn a card into a wild one, which is handy for flushes, so spending $3 for that feels worth it.  \n\nOpening booster packs could yield better jokers. I’m leaning toward replacing Pareidolia with Swashbuckler now, as it’s available. For now, I might not need Pareidolia after all. Although it’s valuable for guaranteeing photo synergy, I can adapt my strategies!\n**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m really weighing the decision to replace Pareidolia, as that might drop our scoring power significantly unless we focus on hands that include face cards. While I can often play flushes, which allow any face card, losing Pareidolia could lead to some hands with missing triggers for photo.\n\nKeeping Pareidolia seems wise because it guarantees triggers on non-face hands. Meanwhile, Swashbuckler could offer a significant boost if I swap it in. \n\nHowever, if I remove the Gift Card, I lose the +10 scaling. I’m thinking the best approach might be to get Antimatter for more jokers later, while I consider buying Blank and Swashbuckler now. It’s a tough call; maybe I should replace Pareidolia but keep evaluating the need for it!\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m estimating typical scoring hands and considering what we’ve used like a full house or two pairs. In ante 5, a three of a kind got 51k, likely leveraging Ancient synergy and photo. With Pareidolia, any trip triggers photo, but with Swash, I could clear blinds more easily with flushes.\n\nI think buying Swash and replacing Pareidolia might be strategic since incorporating face cards is more feasible. Pareidolia mainly enables photo, while Swash offers raw power. So, I’ll start by buying the Blank voucher to set us up for future plays!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
