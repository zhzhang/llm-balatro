{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI’m considering the card game mechanics. Card Sharp used three times for repeated hands might be stronger than Lusty. I think Reserved Parking is unnecessary for economy. Should I rearrange the joker order? I need to ensure that Photograph triggers on the first played face card and that Hanging Chad retriggers correctly. Both effects seem dependent on the order of jokers for triggers and retriggers. If Photograph is scored and triggers Chad, it looks like it could score additional times.\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI think each retrigger repeats the scoring sequence, including on-scored jokers, so the order might not matter between Photograph and Chad. Photograph triggers during the scoring phase while Chad works post-scoring for retriggers. However, if multiple retrigger jokers are involved, the order might be important. I should consider placing Card Sharp and Acrobat later in the order to ensure their multipliers apply correctly, as they seem to be independent. I need to remember that their activation affects the overall score.\n**Analyzing multiplicative effects**\n\nI think multiplicatives in this context multiply the existing multipliers. While the mathematical order of multiplication doesn’t really matter, in the game it does because of the scoring sequence—like x2 followed by x3 or x3 followed by x2. There are also additive multipliers, like Empress cards adding +4 during scoring, which interact with Photograph’s multiplier. So when the first card is scored, its enhancements apply before Photograph triggers, effectively doubling the total multiplier afterwards. This all seems to work out well!\n**Understanding retrigger effects**\n\nI’m realizing that retriggers will reapply the +4 from the mult card each time a card is scored, then Photograph doubles that, which is pretty powerful! We should definitely use Empress on the first card we want to score, as well as other high base chip cards. I’m thinking Lovers could turn wild for easier flushes, but we can’t apply that right now since we’re in the shop. It seems like I need to wait until the round begins to use consumables effectively.\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to reroll the shop for better vouchers or jokers, but I’d have to sell something since there are no joker slots. The reroll costs 7, which seems high given I have 15. I could look for a planet to level up my hands, but the reroll only affects shop cards. Sticking with my current strong combo seems wise, especially since I previously scored 51k. \n\nSelling Card Sharp for Lusty could be an option, but Card Sharp is reliable. I think moving to round selection makes the most sense for now. However, I need to keep Pareidolia since it ensures the first played card is always a face card for Photograph. So yeah, let’s proceed!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
