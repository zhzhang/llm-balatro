{"reasoning":"**Calculating probabilities of hearts**\n\nI'm figuring out the probability of drawing hearts from the remaining deck. So, after keeping 3 hearts, I discard 5 non-hearts from what's left, drawing 5 from the 45 cards remaining. I know there are 15 hearts in the deck, and I'll need at least 2 more from this draw to reach 5 in hand. Based on this setup, my expected hearts from this draw would be about 1.67. It's a bit uncertain, but I think it works!\n**Calculating binomial probabilities**\n\nI'm calculating the probability of getting at least 2 successes in a binomial distribution with n=5 and p=1/3. It comes out to about a 54% chance. If I miss, I can always discard again. After that second discard, it’s fine to fish for more non-hearts. I’m also considering using the Magician to create Lucky cards for better chances with hearts or flus, but since we can exceed 75k already, it might be wiser to save it for a potential boss battle.\n**Estimating scoring margins**\n\nI'm considering whether 100k is too high, but a flush seems likely, even with one joker disabled. There could be risks if Photograph gets disabled, but I still have Smiley and a base flush to rely on. In a worst-case scenario where Smiley is also disabled, my multiplier reduces, so I need to calculate approximate scoring. For example, if I estimate 80 base chips with a 10x multiplier, I might add around 40 chips from the flush cards, bringing my total to about 120 chips, which is quite promising!\n**Clarifying card scoring**\n\nI'm thinking about the order of card scoring from left to right, where Photograph triggers when the first played face card is scored. Since all cards are face cards, the first one activates the x2 multiplier. If I'm using Hanging Chad, it might retrigger that first scored card two additional times, which means it could score again, including any bonuses from Smiley. I wonder if Photograph could activate again with each scoring. However, it seems like the first played face card only counts once per hand, but retriggers could still impact the card's scoring.\n**Planning the discard strategy**\n\nIn Balatro, I know the \"first played face card\" can retrigger and score again, which means the x2 multiplier could stack up to x8—huge potential! With flush scores reaching 292k, I see the opportunity for big gains. Each heart card has a 50% chance to give a x1.5 multiplier when scored, and if I have 5 hearts, that's a solid expectation for extra multipliers. \n\nTo maximize my scoring, I should discard 5 non-hearts (positions 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8), keeping hearts at positions 2, 3, and 4. My goal is to hunt for those hearts and make that flush happen! I'll return a JSON with the discard positions.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,5,6,7,8]"}
