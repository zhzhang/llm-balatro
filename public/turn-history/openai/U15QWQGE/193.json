{"reasoning":"**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm diving into the mechanics of how scoring works with the card game. The first played face card gives a multiplier of x2 each time it’s scored, and it can stack with retriggers, leading to potentially x8. Also, it seems Bloodstone could trigger on heart suit cards, adding a multiplier each time they're scored. To maximize points, I should aim for five hearts—this way, I can get more Bloodstone effects. I'll consider the first card played carefully to optimize scoring.\n**Understanding scoring order**\n\nI need to clarify the scoring order for played cards, which seems to go from left to right. The \"first played face card\" refers to the card that's first in this order. I can select and rearrange my hand to set up the strongest heart card at the beginning. In the game, the play selection likely corresponds to the card order in hand. For retriggers, I should pick a heart and maybe the lucky J♥ for additional multipliers, considering the chance of retriggers.\n**Calculating discard strategy**\n\nI need to take a strategic approach here: I currently have three hearts (K♥, J♥, J♥) and a wild card, but I need at least one more heart. My first step is to discard up to five cards, specifically the non-hearts: A♠, K♠, 9♠, and 9♣. If I discard four, I can redraw four, which keeps my hearts and wild card. There are 15 hearts left out of 44, giving approximately a 34% chance per card. Discarding four cards improves my chances to about 82.7% of drawing at least one heart. I’ll focus on positions 2, 3, 4, and 8 for the discard.\n**Confirming discard strategy**\n\nI’m looking at my hand indices: I have a wild card (10C), an A♠, K♠, 9♠, K♥, and J♥ (lucky) twice, plus a 9♣. For my discard strategy, I plan to discard cards in positions 2, 3, 4, and 8. This means I’ll discard A♠, K♠, 9♠, and 9♣. I’ll go ahead and execute the action command to discard these four cards. No need for further hand type specifications; this feels solid!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,8]"}
