{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nThe Gift Card provides a +10 multiplier, and Holo adds another +10, which is great for increasing sell values. Then there's the Sixth Sense, which generates spectral energy but requires a single six and destroys it. While we can't buy an extra jokers, we can still purchase boosters. \n\nWe have no consumables, but Sixth Sense creates spectral energy during the round if we have space. A Spectral pack might give us powerful effects. Since we have $30, I'll prioritize buying the Spectral pack first to strengthen our deck.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m considering choosing one of the two spectral cards to use immediately, but that will happen in the next state. Alternatively, we could buy a standard pack to add more cards, but spectral cards are definitely more impactful. Given that, I think I’ll go with the spectral pack. It’s the best choice for enhancing our strategy, so let’s proceed with that purchase! It feels like the right move.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
