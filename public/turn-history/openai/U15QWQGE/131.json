{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m at the shop where the jokers are full, and they offer Stuntman, Gluttonous, Hiker, and Lusty. I need to decide whether to buy any or sell what I have. My current build includes Photograph, Hanging Chad, Pareidolia, Ancient Joker, and Swashbuckler, creating a good multiplier system. I'm concerned about weaknesses like needing chip scaling. Stuntman adds +250 chips but reduces my hand size from 8 to 6, which might impact making hands.\n**Analyzing Stuntman effect**\n\nThe Stuntman effect gives +250 chips independently, which could significantly boost my chip total before any multipliers kick in. It's often considered top-tier, so I might consider replacing Ancient or Pareidolia. However, Pareidolia is essential for using Photograph effectively since it treats all cards as face cards. Ancient provides a x1.5 multiplier for specific suits, and since suits change unpredictably, that brings uncertainty. With wild cards counting as any suit, they could help align with Ancient’s scoring, but Stuntman focuses solely on chip gain.\n**Clarifying Photograph's triggers**\n\nI realize that Photograph triggers when the first played face card is scored, giving it a x2 multiplier. If Chad retriggers that first card two more times, Photograph should activate for each scoring instance. This means the x2 multiplier stacks multiplicatively. With three scoring instances (the original plus two retriggers), the total multiplier would be 2^3, which gives a significant multiplier of 8. Pareidolia makes sure any card counts as a face card, ensuring Photograph triggers reliably. While Swash adds a solid +33 multiplier, I may still need more chips overall.\n**Deciding on Stuntman or Ancient**\n\nI’m leaning towards taking Stuntman but first need to free up a joker slot by selling one. Ancient Joker seems like the least consistent option, but it does offer significant multiplicative scaling if the suit aligns, allowing for flush builds. We currently have strong flush and three-of-a-kind capabilities, so maybe we can manage without Ancient. However, Ancient can add up to x7.6 with a five-card flush if the suit matches, which is a huge multiplier. Relying on wilds may not guarantee that fit, though.\n**Planning joker actions**\n\nI'm considering taking Stuntman but need to sell one joker first, likely Ancient since it’s less consistent. While Ancient has great scaling potential, it’s unpredictable, whereas Stuntman adds a consistent +250 chips. My calculations show that with Stuntman, I'll have a substantial score, potentially up to 463k, compared to around 137k without it. Swash is important for maintaining a good multiplier, so I think the best move is to sell Ancient and then buy Stuntman. My immediate action will be to sell Ancient.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
