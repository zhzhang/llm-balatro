{"reasoning":"**Considering tarot card choices**\n\nI'm looking at purchasing the Emperor tarot card, which doesn’t need a target and can be bought and used, but it creates tarots in my inventory, which might require space. If I use it with one free slot, it could create another tarot, though that's random. However, I’m leaning towards buying the Card Sharp first since it's the strongest option. I should just focus on that one action to buy the card in position 1.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
