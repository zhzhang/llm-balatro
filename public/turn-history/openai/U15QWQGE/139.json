{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about how a Straight Flush could be challenging, but with adjustments like converting Sun to hearts and treating Lovers as wild, it might get easier. The concept of pareidolia also turns everything into face cards, which boosts synergy for photography. However, with a hand size reduced to three, it’s still workable since the base is eight. Instead of focusing on leveling the Straight Flush, it could be better to reroll for favorable planets like Jupiter or Venus.\n**Considering spending strategy**\n\nI'm assessing whether to reroll, which costs $6, leaving me with $20. I should try to keep at least $25 to earn more interest after the next round. There’s some confusion over whether I’m at Ante 6 in Round 10, especially after beating Big. For the next Blind Select, I can buy Neptune for $3, which seems low-cost. Using Neptune may help, but it feels wasted if I don’t aim for the Straight Flush. However, I could reroll for better options or possibly find a stronger joker.\n**Evaluating options for action**\n\nI'm considering the Stuntman card, which gives +250 chips but reduces hand size. In late antes, multipliers become more important, and right now, scaling is mainly about xmult and card sharp. A reroll might yield a better joker, but I can only fit one card due to the card slots being reduced. Rerolling costs $6, but is still manageable since I’d rather seek a stronger joker or planet for my hands. Buying Neptune doesn't quite align with my goals, so I think rerolling might be the best move for now.\n**Considering action impacts**\n\nI’m realizing I won’t get a shop turn unless I take more actions. In this interface, each turn allows one action, and the state updates after that action, staying in the shop until I choose to select the next round. So, rerolling now could be beneficial for exploring options. However, I need to think about my interest: a $6 reroll would drop my funds to $20, earning less interest next round. Since I need at least $25 for maximal interest, it’s risky, but I could recover later. Starting the next round with $20 is worth estimating carefully.\n**Exploring options for actions**\n\nI’m considering the end results of my current hands. If I win with two hands left, I could earn an extra $2, which leaves me with $22. Buying Neptune for $3 would adjust that to $23, but it doesn't seem worth it since it doesn't align with my goals. If I do nothing and select the next round, I could end up with $26 or even $33 with interest. Overall, rerolling for better purchase options feels like the best strategy, so I’ll initiate reroll_shop now.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
