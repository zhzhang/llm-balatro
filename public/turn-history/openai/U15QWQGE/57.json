{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m weighing the options with the current setup. Playing one hand may work, but we have a limit on consumables, like the Spectral card that we create. It could be important later. I’m contemplating whether to keep the Sixth Sense for scoring consistency, especially if chips become scarce. Bootstraps can grow with money, which is a consideration too. Gift Cards could also increase in value as rounds progress, so keeping $20 for potential interest seems prudent. I'm just figuring out the optimal balance!\n**Weighing spending strategies**\n\nI want to stay above 25, but I’m currently at 23. Purchasing could drop me below 20. If I don't buy anything, I can maintain my 23 and earn interest at the end of the next round, which I prefer. I could buy a standard pack for $4 to possibly get useful face cards, but the options aren’t great. Rerolling also costs 4 right now, which might reduce my interest. Maybe it’s better to buy Bootstraps, but I need a slot! Selling Sixth Sense for Bootstraps could give better immediate returns. Balancing risks and rewards feels tricky!\n**Calculating multiplier potential**\n\nI'm working out the multipliers. The base multiplier for a Flush level 4 is 10, and then I have a Gift Card that adds another +10, plus the Holo edition which gives another +10. The Photograph doubles the multiplier when the first face card is scored, and Hanging Chad lets me retrigger that face card two more times. \n\nI think the Photograph should apply the x2 multiplier each time it's scored again, potentially reaching x8, which is impressive! The key will be to play a scoring hand where the leftmost scoring card is a face card like J, Q, or K.\n**Optimizing multiplier strategy**\n\nI need to ensure face cards are included in the hand for Flushes, which require any 5 suited cards. The deck likely contains face cards to help boost the multipliers. My base multiplier starts at 10, with an additional 20 from the Gift Card, making it 30. If I factor in the Photograph for x8, that could bring it to 240. \n\nWith a base of 80 chips, I might be looking at an enormous score of 28,800, which seems strong enough for ante 3 bosses. I think I can focus on improving my economy and deck instead of just chasing more multipliers. Bootstraps could add more later if funds increase.\n**Strategizing shop decisions**\n\nI want to keep my money high, but to buy something, I’d need to sell, which could limit future spectral opportunities. Buying the Standard Pack could add improved cards, but it might dilute my deck too. With $23, I can reach $27 in interest by not spending, which would be smart. I need to prepare for the next boss blind in Ante 3, especially considering that certain bosses debuff face cards.\n\nSince they can hurt my scoring potential, I should consider rerolling for consumables or enhancements. However, I might not need to if my scoring remains strong. Bootstraps seem to be a better investment to boost multipliers in the long term, especially if I can maintain my current jokers. I think I'll save my money for the interest and proceed to round-select, focusing on preparation for the boss.\n**Understanding joker interactions**\n\nI'm working through how Hanging Chad and Photograph interact. Since Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card used in scoring twice, I need to consider the order in which they trigger. If Photograph is played before Hanging Chad, it modifies the multiplier first, and then Hanging Chad can retrigger that scoring. However, since Hanging Chad is a retriggering joker, its position might only matter relative to other retrigger cards rather than Photograph. \n\nActually, the order doesn't seem to matter overall, so I think it’s best to move on. With the reroll cost at 4 and my total at $23, it’s smarter to preserve my funds for now. I’ll choose the round-select action.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
