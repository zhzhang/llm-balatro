{"reasoning":"**Evaluating poker strategy**\n\nI'm pondering the strategy for the Big Blind in poker, where there's no 5-card restriction. I think maybe I can reach a 7500 threshold with a strong hand. Last time, I scored 5130, and I wonder if I can hit that target in two hands. Skipping the current play gives a substantial orbital tag that might upgrade my hand type, which can affect my chips and multiplier. But I also need to weigh the importance of earning $4 before facing the boss.\n**Assessing boss card requirements**\n\nI’m reflecting on the boss’s requirement to play five cards, which might lower my score if I focus on high cards with a retrigger feature. However, playing five cards lets the strongest hands like a flush or straight win. Our flush has a solid base of 80x10, and I need to think about how cards can retrigger. If I can form a flush with Ancient's suit, that would boost my multiplier significantly, but the unknown deck composition complicates things. I'm worried about the tactics when the boss demands five cards.\n**Considering five-card requirements**\n\nI’m considering the rule that I must play five cards, where the best hand might only be a pair, which limits scoring to just those cards. If I try to play a high card, it won’t work unless all five cards are different suits or ranks. If I accidentally make a pair, then two cards could score, which complicates my strategy. I also want to ensure that the first card I score is the one that retriggers since that’s important for maximizing my chips.\n**Analyzing the boss strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about playing a pair for the boss, ensuring the first card is part of that pair since it retriggers. With the Photog feature, it triggers on the first face card, and since all cards with Pareidolia are faces, I need to be cautious about which one to score first. To hit that 7500 threshold, a big flush with multipliers seems necessary, but I also need money for the shop. Skipping gives no funds, which is risky, but an orbital tag could upgrade my flush to make the boss easier to beat.\n**Considering shop cash and rounds**\n\nI’m realizing how important it is to have cash for the shop right now, so I think playing the big blind is essential. I'm also considering that the Ancient feature changes the suit at the end of the round, currently indicating diamonds. If I skip the big blind, I’m unsure if it will still count as the end of the round, but it seems safer to assume the suit only changes after I play. Regardless, I need to focus on the action and play the round, so I’ll need to output JSON for that without specifying positions.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
