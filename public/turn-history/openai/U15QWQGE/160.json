{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI'm looking into the X2 Mult option, which has a 1 in 4 chance of destroying a card. It's a bit risky, but the scaling potential with glass cards could be huge—though we don’t have any glass cards. The Blue Joker feels safer and more consistent, enhancing all hands. With our current setup of 4 jokers and room for one more, I can buy the Blue Joker for $5, leaving me with $1. The Glass Joker's risks just don’t seem worth it right now, so I'll go with the Blue Joker.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about how the Photograph is \"on scored\" and what that means for card scoring. The order of jokers from left to right matters. Photograph triggers with face cards, while Hanging Chad seems to retrigger the first played card during scoring. It’s a bit tricky since Hanging Chad may activate after the card is scored, but I've got to follow the rules! I need to ensure Photograph and Bloodstone both apply before any retriggers. But since they’re both multipliers, their order might not affect the overall result.\n**Determining Blue Joker's impact**\n\nI’m considering the Blue Joker's role as an independent in category 5. The order of independent jokers impacts additive multipliers, but only the chips from the Blue Joker contribute. This independent stage happens after cards are held and scored. The Blue Joker adds chips to the total before the final multiplication. So, it seems that this addition is fine. There’s no order to worry about with the other independent jokers, so I’ll proceed with the command to buy card 3 using the JSON response format.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [3]"}
