{"reasoning":"**Evaluating build effects**\n\nI'm looking at our current build, which already produces a significant multiplier with effects like Droll's addition of +10 and Bull's chips scaling with that multiplier. Bull adds 84 chips to the base, which could have a notable impact. My current flush score is around 104k, just over the 100k big blind, but I think we need more. Buying Hermit could boost money (up to +20), increasing Bull's chips nicely. Using Hermit costs $3 and can maximize our gains. We should consider these options!\n**Analyzing consumables and upgrades**\n\nI'm considering the Hermit card, which is a tarot consumable. We can buy and use it for $3, which immediately doubles our money. Starting with $42, we'd spend $3, leaving us with $39, and then we’d gain a maximum of $20, totaling $59. This means Bull would now give us +118 chips instead of +84, which is a substantial increase! \n\nNext, I'm thinking about Droll Joker, which costs $4. If we buy this, we might have to swap it with Smiley, who currently gives us a +25 multiplier. I'll need to weigh those options carefully!\n**Calculating multipliers and triggers**\n\nEach scored card gives a +5 multiplier, and with Hanging Chad retriggering the first scored card twice, Smiley would trigger for that card three times. For a 5-card flush, we get 7 scoring events, leading to a total of +35 from Smiley. That’s quite significant!\n\nNow, regarding Photograph: it gives a x2 multiplier when the first face card is scored. I’m assuming it triggers each time that card is scored, so if Chad retriggers twice, it might apply the x2 thrice. However, I'm a bit uncertain about whether it only triggers once per hand despite retriggers. I’ll need to clarify that further!\n**Deciding on card options**\n\nPareidolia enhances Smiley and Photograph by turning everything into faces, so I definitely want to keep those. Hanging Chad is also crucial for retriggering, which boosts both our chips and joker triggers. Bull is significantly beneficial for chips. \n\nIf I need to drop something for Droll, maybe it should be Photograph, but it provides a valuable x2 multiplier, especially if it retriggers. Smiley gives a solid +35, while Droll only adds +10, so it doesn’t seem worth replacing. Merry Andy’s +3 discards could help with flush assembly, but the -1 hand size could limit our ability. Overall, it seems best not to take the risk right now.\n**Considering card strategy and actions**\n\nI'm evaluating whether to include Pluto levels or look into standard packs with a focus on hearts or high faces. After using Hermit, we might want to reroll the shop for a better joker, perhaps something that offers a multiplier or flush synergy like The Tribe. \n\nHowever, rerolling costs $4 each time, and since we want to maintain strong Bull scaling, I need to be cautious, as each reroll reduces Bull chips. It makes sense to prioritize using Hermit to boost our funds first. \n\nAs for joker ordering, I want to keep Smiley before Photograph to maximize the multipliers. Currently, the order is good, and I’ll stick with that. The next step: I’m going to buy and use Hermit now! I’ll execute that action.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
