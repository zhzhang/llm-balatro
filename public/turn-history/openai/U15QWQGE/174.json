{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip totals**\n\nI’m adding chips from the scoring cards: 8H contributes +58 with the foil edition, plus the others — 7H=7, 5H=5, 4H=4, and QC wild=10. That gives me a subtotal of 84. Adding the base chips of 80 brings it to 164. Then, the Blue Joker adds +82 chips, which is independent of any multipliers. So my total now is 246. The Photograph gives me a multiplier, affecting the scoring of the 8H. It all gets a bit complex!\n**Analyzing Photograph and multipliers**\n\nIt seems like the Photograph card gives a 2x multiplier when the first played face card is scored. I think it triggers again with retriggers, since every time the card scores, it’s still considered the first. So, it multiplies by 2 each time, leading to an overall multiplier of 8 after three scores. \n\nThere’s also Bloodstone, which could add another layer, giving a 1.5x chance on every scoring of the 8H. If we can count QC wild as a heart, it might trigger Bloodstone too! This is getting complex but exciting!\n**Estimating chip totals**\n\nI’m looking at 5 cards, each with a 1 in 2 chance for a 1.5x multiplier, along with the 8H having 3 scoring events, bringing my total to 7 potential scoring events for Bloodstone. In a best-case scenario, that could be an x1.5 raised to the 7th power, giving me about 17.1. \n\nHowever, if we assume about half of those proc, we're looking at maybe x3.375 or x5.06, and then when combined with the Photograph, I might reach up to x40. Even with fewer successes, like 2, I’d still likely have a winning hand, estimating around 70,000 chips.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,6]"}
