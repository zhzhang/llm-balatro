{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm thinking it’s best to start with a hand that includes a face card, like the King of Hearts. Unfortunately, that's my only face card right now, and I'm hoping to create a flush with it on the left. Currently, I have two hearts, three spades, and three clubs, so I might need to discard some spades or lower clubs to try for more hearts since there are plenty left in the deck. \n\nI could also consider scoring with a pair of nines or just the King for a high card.\n**Calculating chip multipliers**\n\nI’m figuring out the chip totals based on different factors. The Foil edition adds 50 chips to the joker independently, while the Mail-In Rebate also provides an additional 50 chips when scored. The Gift Card adds a multiplier of 10 along with the holo for an extra 10. For high cards, the base multiplier is 1, then I get 20 from the gift. If I play the King as my first face card, it also doubles the score. So I could wind up with a significant total!\n**Calculating total chips and multipliers**\n\nI've realized that the Hanging Chad retriggers the score for my first card, the King, two times. Each time it scores, it should also activate the Photograph, which means it's a bonus each time. I think that will lead to an x8 multiplier! \n\nStarting with a base of 21, I multiply that by 8 to get 168. For chips, I have a base of 5 plus 10 for each scoring instance, totaling 35. After adding extra chips from the Mail-in rebate, I end up with 85 chips. My final chip count should be 85 times 168, which gives me 14,280.\n**Formulating the winning strategy**\n\nI’ve realized that playing just the King of Hearts will clear the boss in one hand, even as a high card. It's great because I need to ensure no other cards are included. The King scores perfectly since it isn’t affected by debuffs on the spades. I’ll also need to confirm that the Photograph triggers by playing the King as the first face card. However, I can't use the Wraith consumable right now. So, my action is to play the King in position 4, targeting a high card with an estimated score of 14,000 chips.\n**Finalizing the strategy and calculations**\n\nI’m estimating my scoring from the previous hand with a single 6 of hearts. With a base of 5 chips plus an additional 6 from the cards, I have 23 total. After the mail-in rebate of 50 chips, that brings the total to 73. I discovered that my multiplier of 21 was incorrect — it looks like the gift card’s +10 and the holo's multipliers weren’t stacking as I thought.\n\nI recalculated everything and found my total multiplier is actually 11. This means if I play the King with the Photograph, the multiplied score becomes 88. With the King’s total chips at 85, multiplying them gives 7,480, which exceeds my required score of 4,000. Since the Photograph correctly triggers multiple times, playing just the King is the best move for me!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4]"}
