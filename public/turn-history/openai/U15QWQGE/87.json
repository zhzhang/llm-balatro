{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop actions**\n\nI need to choose what to do next in the shop with $7. The options are a Tower tarot for $3, a Superposition joker for $4, or a standard pack also for $4. Rerolling costs $3. My goal is to strengthen my position for the upcoming blinds, which seem to be approaching. I just finished a small blind round with a decent chip count. My joker set is performing well, and I’m aiming to enhance my multipliers and chip count further.\n**Evaluating Superposition joker**\n\nIn the shop, there's a Superposition joker that can create tarot if my hand contains an Ace and is a straight. However, this doesn't really fit with my current build. I can make straights now and then, but it’s not my main focus. Plus, it needs a consumable slot to create a tarot, and I'm currently full. If I can't create one due to no space, it doesn't seem worth it unless I clear a slot and plan for straights. The Tower tarot might be a better option to consider.\n**Analyzing card options**\n\nIn the cards section, the Tower costs $3, but it's a consumable tarot that requires a target card in hand, which means I can't buy and use it in the shop. I'd need to clear a consumable slot first. The standard pack costs $4 and doesn’t take up space, adding a playing card instead. With $7, I could buy the standard pack, leaving me with $3 for a reroll or the Tower, but I can’t use it without a free slot. I could also consider using Justice, but I don’t have any target cards available in the shop right now.\n**Considering Wraith and joker slots**\n\nThe Wraith can be used without a target, but I need to clear a joker slot first because it creates a random rare joker. I'm realizing Wraith is a consumable that sets money to $0, which complicates things since I only have $7 now. It seems smarter to sell a joker before using Wraith. I could spend down to maximize its effect; however, keeping some funds for future purchases and interest is also essential. My current build is strong enough for the ante, but maybe I should keep Wraith for a later time when I have more money available.\n**Weighing Wraith usage and strategy**\n\nUsing Wraith sets my money to $0, so it’s best to spend everything else first to minimize losses. However, Wraith takes a consumable slot that I'm currently full on. I could consider selling Justice to free up space for new cards, but it’s useful for enhancing key cards. The chance of destruction with Justice is risky, but it could boost scoring significantly. \n\nIt seems I might want to use Wraith later, but using it now could free a slot for more consumables. Selling a joker like Gift or Smiley could provide room, but it also comes with its drawbacks. Ultimately, my current build is solid enough, so investing in a standard pack seems like a safer option for now.\n**Assessing the Tower and stone cards**\n\nThe Tower can enhance a low-rank card into a stone card, which adds +50 chips but removes suit and rank. Since stone cards don’t contribute to any poker hand or type, they can't help with flush or straight strategies. However, they always score 50 chips when played, which might trigger other effects like multipliers with jokers. \n\nUsing stone cards can be beneficial for chip scaling, especially in my current strategy focusing on high cards. Given the limitations with my slots and consumables, buying a standard pack seems like the best option now.\n**Considering next moves with cards**\n\nI think it might be worth looking for planet cards or tarot, but our consumable slots are full right now. However, since planets don’t require a target, we could buy and use them immediately even if our slots are full. \n\nI've got $7, and rerolling costs $3, leaving me with enough to buy a planet afterward. I don't see any planets in the shop currently, though, so a reroll could be a good choice. After considering the options, I’ve decided to buy a standard pack, as it could give me some stronger cards!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
