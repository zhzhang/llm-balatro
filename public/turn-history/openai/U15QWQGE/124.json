{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game rounds and scoring**\n\nI’m thinking about round 10 and how we've beaten 10 blinds already. There are different antes for the rounds, but since we’re at ante 6, that means round 10 doesn’t fit. I wonder if the round in metadata refers to the number of shops or something else. \n\nI feel like Chaos makes sense for gameplay but could use a joker slot. Maybe I should replace it with a Gift Card since it gives a +10 multiplier and increases sell values, which could be more beneficial in high antes.\n**Evaluating joker choices and multipliers**\n\nAlright, we already have $43. It looks like Swashbuckler increases the sell value of other jokers, currently adding a +46 multiplier, which could be more beneficial than Gift or Pareidolia. But to make room for Swash, I'd have to sell one joker.\n\nIf I sell Pareidolia for $6 and buy Swash for $4, the remaining sell values add up to +40 multiplier. However, losing Pareidolia means I’d only trigger the Photo card if the first card played is a face card. While I can play a face card intentionally, not drawing one could severely impact my scoring potential.\n**Deciding between jokers**\n\nI’m thinking Pareidolia is crucial, so I shouldn’t sell it. Instead, I’m considering selling the Gift Card. If I do, Swash would give a +33 multiplier by adding the sell values of the remaining jokers. This would be a significant boost, but I’d lose the Gift Card's scaling effect and its +10 multiplier.\n\nThe Gift Card also increases the sell values of jokers each round, which could help with Swash's multiplier. Yet, I'd need a sixth slot for Swash. It feels like I need to choose wisely between them.\n**Analyzing multiplicative effects**\n\nI’m considering the Gift Card’s +10 multiplier and how it's independent, while Swash adds a larger additive effect. It seems like Swash could be more beneficial. The base multiplier for three of a kind is 11, and adding Gift's +10 takes it to 21. But for scoring, the order matters. The multiplicative effects occur before the independent ones. So if I understand correctly, Swash and Gift's effects will apply after the photograph and ancient jokers, adjusting the overall multiplier based on their order of application. That's crucial to remember!\n**Considering jokers and options**\n\nI'm weighing my options for jokers, especially between Gift and Swashbuckler. Gift's +10 multiplier comes after other multipliers, which doesn't scale nicely. Swash's +46 multiplier adds directly to the final total, making it potentially stronger. \n\nBut I also need to consider its impact on scoring. Swash is likely a better choice, especially since it allows me to push scoring without needing Gift's scaling for sell values. I might also look into buying a Buffoon pack since our current money situation is stable. However, I should think about opening a slot first so I don’t miss any valuable joker options.\n**Weighing joker options**\n\nI’m stuck between selling Gift or buying Swash. Keeping Gift provides a +10 multiplier, but if I sell it, I can open a slot for a Buffoon pack. The pack could offer valuable jokers, but I risk losing Gift permanently, which supports my scoring. \n\nIf I buy Swash now, it'd mean I could increase my multiplier significantly, but it sacrifices Gift. Given my current money, I think I should opt for the Buffoon pack first. That way, I have a chance to find a better joker before making any other decisions.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
