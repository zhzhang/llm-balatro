{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game purchases**\n\nI’m in a shop with $43 and currently have 4 jokers. I can buy Stuntman without selling anything since it costs +250 chips but reduces my hand size by 2. This is a big decision! The +250 chips has a significant impact on scoring, especially with my current multipliers like Gift Card and Photograph. Reducing my hand size to 6 might limit some combinations, but I can still manage with flushes and full houses.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’ve decided to buy Stuntman. As for other shop items, I’m ignoring Oops! All 6s since we don't have luck-based jokers. The Zany Joker offers a +12 multiplier if I have Three of a Kind, which could be useful, but our current strategy isn’t focused on trips. I need to consider the Photograph and Hanging Chad synergy, where each trigger could potentially yield multiple scoring opportunities. I’m not sure how the triggers interact, but it seems like they could benefit each other in scoring.\n**Deciding on game purchases**\n\nI’m considering how the Photograph can double the multiplier on each scoring event, potentially making it x8 from two retriggers! The Photograph gives a x2 multiplier when scored, so it could have a significant impact with my base multiplier. I see that Overstock Plus can add an extra shop slot for $10, which could help me find jokers or planets. Since I have enough funds, I think my best move for now is to buy Stuntman. I’ll proceed with that purchase.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
