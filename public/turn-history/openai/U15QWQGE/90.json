{"reasoning":"**Considering joker strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about using Wraith to create a random rare joker, which would set our money to $0. But we have an open joker slot, and that rare joker could be powerful. Since we only have $5, it feels logically free to use Wraith now, as cash resets, but I also wonder if spending money on something worthwhile first might be better. There are purchasables like Superposition for $4, but I considered rerolling first to potentially find a better joker or planet. Ultimately, I'd prefer to maximize the use of my money before using Wraith.\n**Evaluating strategy options**\n\nI'm thinking I should reroll first to find something worthwhile to buy before using Wraith. With $5, I could reroll for $3, leaving me with $2, which might not allow for many jokers or anything significant. I could also consider selling Justice to buy the Tower, but it seems kind of mediocre. Maybe I should purchase Superposition for $4, leaving just $1, and then use Wraith to get a random rare joker—though I risk filling up joker slots. Keeping cash for future rounds could be a better option, but Wraith resets the money if I use it. Selling Wraith for $4 might allow me to maintain some funds for later shopping.\n**Analyzing joker impact**\n\nThe rare joker could be a game-changer for my current build, which includes Photograph, Chad, Pareidolia, and the Gift Card that gives a +10 multiplier. This setup focuses on face cards. With Pareidolia, all cards act as face cards. Photograph doubles the multiplier for the first played face card, while Chad can retrigger that card twice. That means the first card could score three times with a compounded multiplier, potentially reaching x8 in total. The Gift Card adds a steady +10 multiplier, making it smart to play high-value cards to maximize the boost.\n**Weighing the joker options**\n\nI’m banking on a single boosted card to generate a huge multiplier. Using a rare joker, like Cavendish, could further increase that multiplier or add chips, so it might be worth using Wraith. However, I worry that it could create something incompatible or even negative. Wraith does set money to $0, but since I have vouchers for cheaper rerolls, there's some flexibility. Plus, the Gift Card increases sell value each round, which will support my economy. So, it’s a balancing act!\nI'm contemplating my next moves with $5. It seems like buying something beneficial now isn't really necessary since neither Superposition nor the Tower offers much value. I could reroll for $3 to see if there's a better joker or item, but that leaves me with $2, which might not get me anything good. Selling Justice frees up some cash but I question its necessity since it could enhance my future cards. \n\nI'm leaning towards using Wraith now to get a rare joker, as I don't have great spending options, and I can always adjust my jokers’ order later if needed. However, I'm still torn—rerolling might reveal a great joker, yet I worry about the budget constraints. It seems best to try for a rare joker first, then decide about the spending later!\n**Deciding on using Wraith**\n\nI think I should avoid buying Superposition—it doesn’t seem beneficial right now. I could reroll without spending, but that would leave me with just $2, which isn’t enough for typical items unless I get lucky with a cheap tarot. So, it might be best to use Wraith now. \n\nIt creates a random Rare Joker and sets my money to $0, which means losing my $5, but that’s okay since the Gift Card provides a +10 multiplier. I’ll just go ahead and use this consumable!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
