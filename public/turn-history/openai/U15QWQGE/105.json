{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nIf we skip small blind, we could go for a big blind selection. That means we can either play big or choose to skip for an ethereal tag, which seems like a free spectral pack. But if we skip big, we end up at the boss without access to a shop, and we can’t skip the boss. Defeating the boss would allow us to reach the shop, and we could accumulate tags. The investment tag grants $25 after beating the boss, whereas the ethereal tag likely offers a spectral pack, possibly at the next shop. Skipping big means no shop again, though. I wonder if our deck can beat scores of 11,000 and 16,500 and then tackle the 22,000 boss with the random discard of 2 cards per hand. My current engine setup—Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Pareidolia—ensures the first scoring card triggers Photograph twice and retriggers the first scoring card 2 extra times.\n**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nThe Gift Card gives a +10 multiplier, while the Ancient Joker provides a x1.5 multiplier for each card played from the designated suit, hearts in this case. This value changes at the end of each round. Since Pareidolia makes all cards face cards, the Photograph triggers on the first scoring card. I want to have the highest chip card as the first scoring card and aim for flushes or three of a kind. The chip requirements are small (11,000), which should be manageable, and big (16,500), which might be possible with a strong pair. The boss, at 22,000, discards two random cards from my hand after every hand played, disrupting my ability to plan ahead. It's crucial to hit that 22,000 threshold in one or two hands.\n**Evaluating hand performance**\n\nOur best performance was a pair that scored 20,332 in the big blind ante of 4. This indicates that scoring 20k with a pair is possible. However, in the boss ante, I only got 7,434 from a straight, which feels inconsistent. The two pairs scored 4,352, while another pair only netted 2,600. It looks like the 20k score may have been an outlier due to the Ancient suit match and high card. Our hand levels include flushes, three of a kind, full houses, and two pairs which are now at level 2. It appears our scoring highly relies on the Ancient Joker suit matching for multiple cards. If the suit is hearts, I can try to play flush hearts. However, Pareidolia doesn’t change suits. The Ancient Joker provides a x1.5 multiplier for each matching suit card when scored, which could retrigger for additional multipliers as each subsequent scoring card applies the x1.5 again.\n**Calculating scoring potential**\n\nWith five cards, the multiplier reaches x1.5^5, which is 7.59—huge! If Hanging Chad retriggers the first scoring card twice, that card will trigger Ancient each time, leading to an additional x1.5^2, resulting in 2.25. Now, I’m curious if Photograph triggers again on these retriggers. It mentions that the \"first played face card gives a x2 multiplier when scored,\" suggesting that each retrigger counts as a new scoring event, likely activating Photograph.\n\nThe goal would be to play a flush or any hand using all five cards of the Ancient suit. However, my deck has 14 hearts and fewer diamonds or clubs. The probability of drawing enough hearts for a flush is decent, but not guaranteed with an 8-card hand, plus accounting for discards. For smaller blinds, I might just play any hand.\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nSkipping the small blind to get the Investment tag might be worth it since we can still play big and then go to the shop afterwards. Once I beat the big blind, I’d go to the shop, which is a solid plan. Although skipping small means we miss one shop opportunity and the $3 reward, the Investment tag gives $25 after defeating the boss, which is huge.\n\nYes, skipping small prevents you from benefiting from increasing sell values at the end of the round, which is something to consider, but primarily, I want to save up for purchases. Beating the small blind could allow me to enter a shop early and potentially buy useful items. However, the Investment tag seems more advantageous overall. Additionally, I do need to consider the challenge of the boss at 22,000.  \n\nSo, since we can skip the small blind and still secure a shop after beating the big blind, let's go ahead and register the action to skip. I’m going to return a JSON action for \"skip_round,\" so we get that Investment tag!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
