{"reasoning":"**Evaluating spectral pack choices**\n\nI’m considering whether to choose Aura or Wraith. Wraith has intriguing features by creating a random rare joker but also sets my money to 0. Right now, I have decent jokers and $26, but if I choose Wraith, I’m at max jokers, which complicates things. If there's no space, it usually fails, though Wraith states it creates a joker. Selling one joker first might be a strategy before making my selection, but is it the right move?\n**Weighing joker options**\n\nThe rare joker could be a powerful choice, but losing $26 is a significant risk, and I might end up with a weaker joker. The Gift Card boosts sell values, while the synergy with Photograph and Hanging Chad looks promising. Aura can enhance a card in hand with Foil, Holo, or Polychrome, which is appealing, especially since I have a 6 of hearts. However, it seems Aura might apply one of these randomly. Ideally, I’d like to target a face card for synergy, but my hand lacks any face cards.\n**Deciding card upgrades**\n\nI’m considering whether to target the Ace of Diamonds, as it's a high card that could be valuable, but editions also add chips and multipliers when scored, regardless of rank. It seems smart to focus on cards that'll likely be played often, especially for flushes since I already have a level 4 flush. In my hand, I have heart cards like the 8 of hearts and 6 of hearts. The 8 might be a better choice for flushes, but the 6 has potential with the Sixth Sense effect. Yet upgrading the 6 could be risky since the effect would destroy it.\n**Finalizing card choice**\n\nOkay, it’s clear I shouldn’t target the 6 if I plan to use Sixth Sense, since that could lead to losing it. Instead, I think it's better to sacrifice a weaker card if needed. Therefore, I’ll focus on applying Aura to the 8 of hearts, which is a strong choice for flushes, since it benefits any card played. I’ll select the 8 of hearts in position 2, using the command \"select 1 2\" to ensure I get this right. Let’s go for it!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,2]"}
