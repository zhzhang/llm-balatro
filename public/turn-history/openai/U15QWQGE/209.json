{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nI'm exploring the concept of Pareidolia where all cards are face cards, but queens still hold their status. In a flush game, you generally want to hold a queen since it can significantly increase your multiplier. However, leaving a queen unplayed could reduce your flush potential if it's a needed heart. Fortunately, the deck has many hearts. There’s also synergy to consider with Smiley, which operates independently from held cards. So there's a lot of strategy to navigate!\n**Evaluating chip strategies**\n\nI'm considering how Bull adds chips, but its impact seems less than the +13 multiplier per queen. Still, Bull could provide a substantial +90 chips, which boosts my base flush chips. It’s a significant increase when comparing different scenarios. \n\nI realize that while both chips and multipliers are important, the order of operations matters—like the effect of Photograph, which doubles the multiplier when the first face card is scored. I need to carefully weigh these factors during gameplay!\n**Analyzing multiplier strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about how the later step adds a multiplier that could interact with independent multipliers. Photograph applies earlier, doubling the multiplier, which means any subsequent additive multipliers are not doubled. For example, if I start with a base multiplier of 10, then after a Smiley card, Photograph doubles that before adding any further points from Shoot the Moon. \n\nI realize I have to replace a jokers. I'm considering Bull or Pareidolia; the latter enables Smiley to trigger on all played cards—definitely a strong synergy since it could boost my multiplier significantly!\n**Weighing card options**\n\nI'm considering the effect of Photograph, which gives a x2 multiplier on the first card scored, and how that interacts with Chad's retriggers. Bull adds +90 chips independently, which is good, but I wonder if it's weaker than Shoot the Moon, especially since I could hold 2 queens for an added +26 multiplier. The deck has 3 queens, so I might draw 1 or 2, but I need to manage the flush requirements. \n\nIn terms of multiplier potential, holding multiple queens could yield significant boosts, possibly making Shoot the Moon a better choice despite the loss of chips from Bull!\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI'm digesting the impact of chips and multipliers. Bull provides +90 chips, which can significantly add to my score, especially when multiplied by high multipliers, but it relies on current money. If I spend on Shoot the Moon, I lose some chips but could gain elsewhere. I'm debating which joker to sell—Bull, Smiley, or Chad—and realizing it’s important to keep critical cards like Pareidolia and Photograph for multiplier integrity. Rerolling for a stronger joker seems like the best option as I assess potential upgrades before facing the final boss!\n**Deciding on next action**\n\nI’m set on the next step: a reroll at the shop to find a better joker. There’s no risk in not using the shop, so it seems like a good choice. I also realize the order of my jokers matters: with Smiley and Photograph being on-scored, I want Smiley to go first to maximize the multiplier effect from Photograph. Hanging Chad is a retrigger joker, but its placement isn’t critical. With all this in mind, rerolling feels like the right action!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
