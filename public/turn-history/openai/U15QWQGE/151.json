{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop action**\n\nI need to choose my next action in the shop. We've already sold Acrobat, and now we have a maximum of four to five jokers, so I can buy Bloodstone without needing to sell anything. I have $25 to spend, and Bloodstone has a strong synergy with hearts and retriggers. It seems like the best option is to buy Bloodstone (card position 4). I might consider The Star tarot for diamond conversion later, but for now, I'll focus on Bloodstone.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [4]"}
