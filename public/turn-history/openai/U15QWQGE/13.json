{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm in a situation where I can choose a \"blind select\" with a small reward of $3. However, there's also the option to skip and potentially gain a valuable Investment Tag after defeating a Boss, worth $25. Skipping means no shopping opportunity, which could impact my financial situation. I currently have $2, and playing the small could yield additional coins, plus interest from hands left over. The tag looks tempting, but I'll need to defeat the boss to earn it.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI have some jokers that can really help, like the Gift Card offering a +10 multiplier and a Mail-In Rebate for +50 chips, plus the Trading Card that can be worth $3 for the first discard. I'm trying to consider the chip requirements of 800, 1200, and 1600. Our full house got 200 in ante1, and my base flush level can give 50 chips, which could be my best option. It seems beneficial to play small first to activate rebates, but skipping that might hinder my ability to shop afterward.\n**Clarifying shop rules**\n\nI realized that shopping happens after winning a round, and each blind is considered a round. So, if I skip small, I lose my chance to shop there but can play big and still shop after that, right? That seems likely. In Balatro, skipping a blind means skipping its shop, which could hurt my early game strategy. But the investment tag is a big deal! If I play small and win, I’d earn $3 plus potential extra from hands, versus the big reward from beating the boss if I skip.\n**Deciding on the next move**\n\nIf I skip the small blind and then play the big blind, I can shop afterward to prepare for the boss, which sounds good. However, if I skip the big blind for the Foil Tag, I might risk going straight to the boss with my current deck. I think it’s smart to skip small first to grab the Investment Tag, but I wonder if it stacks with the gift card. Skipping might limit my end-of-round benefits, but I need to decide what’s more beneficial.\n**Evaluating the tag value**\n\nThis situation looks like I’m effectively getting an additional $3 in resale for each round, though it won’t be immediate. Missing out on one round only slightly affects my future sales, reducing them by that same $3, which seems minor. I think it's better to take the tag, so my next move will be to officially skip the round. This decision feels solid, as it can lead to better opportunities down the line!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
