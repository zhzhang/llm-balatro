{"reasoning":"**Clarifying joker scoring effects**\n\nI’m working through how the jokers like Smiley and Photograph apply during scoring. Their effects change the multiplier. Independent jokers like Gift apply after scoring. It seems that ordering between on-scored jokers and independent jokers is in separate categories, so position doesn’t affect them. Even if Gift is positioned between Smiley and Photograph, it doesn't trigger during scoring. The left-to-right order matters only among on-scored triggers when checking relative positions.\n**Deciding joker order and max limits**\n\nI’m exploring the order of jokers like Smiley, Gift, and Photograph during the on-scored stage. Smiley triggers first, and then Photograph, while Gift does nothing, preserving relative order. I’m considering an order of Pareidolia, Smiley, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Gift Card, but we need to remember the max is five jokers. Since we currently have four, I can only add one more, which makes it a choice between Pareidolia and Smiley. Pareidolia might be stronger because it enables Photograph easily, and with eight cards now, I can still play a face card to trigger it.\n**Choosing between Pareidolia and Smiley**\n\nThe boss requires playing five cards, and I need to include at least one face card in the scoring hand. Pareidolia guarantees a consistent photo trigger for flushes, which is important, so I’m leaning towards it over Smiley. However, Smiley might add a multiplier of +25 for each hand. Still, we have Photograph giving a powerful multiplier if a face card is first. Without Pareidolia, I would need to ensure a face card is the first one played, which complicates the strategy.\n**Evaluating joker options**\n\nWith the high card strategy, I need to ensure that the highest card is a face card, which can be a challenge sometimes if I don't have one in my hand. Pareidolia can turn all cards into \"face\" cards, which helps with scoring using Photograph. Since it triggers the first played face card for a multiplier, it seems wise to prioritize buying Pareidolia for consistency. However, if I opt for Smiley, I maintain the need to play face cards, but they provide a +5 multiplier each when scored. Maybe selling Acrobat could create room to buy both jokers?\n**Deciding between jokers**\n\nI’m weighing whether to keep Acrobat, which has a multiplier of x3 for the final hand, or prioritize buying Pareidolia and Smiley. Acrobat may not be necessary if I can win quickly since its bonus only activates in the last hand. Selling it could open up space for two new jokers, but I still need to consider the added value of Gift Card. In simulations, combinations of jokers show Pareidolia and Smiley significantly boost my scores. Ultimately, I’m leaning toward selling Acrobat to get both new jokers, as they seem crucial for maximizing potential.\n**Deciding joker purchases**\n\nI’m considering buying Smiley and keeping Acrobat, but I think Pareidolia could be more valuable. It might make sense to get Pareidolia now and hold onto Acrobat for later, but since scaling is important, having both could be beneficial for upcoming antes. Selling Acrobat now means losing potential value later, plus there's the Gift Card effect to think about. I also have Wraith available to potentially get a rare joker, though it would set my money to zero. For now, I'll sell Acrobat and buy both Pareidolia and Smiley.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
