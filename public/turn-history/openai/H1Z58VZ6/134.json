{"reasoning":"**Evaluating square joker rules**\n\nIt seems like the square joker is part of a holographic edition with a specific chip bonus. It provides +68 chips and increases that amount by 4 each time I play exactly 4 cards. I'm wondering if the +68 chips always apply independently. The square joker seems to accumulate chips permanently if I play a hand with exactly 4 cards. For scoring, I want to make sure I understand how it works in relation to increasing my score.\n**Analyzing card gameplay strategy**\n\nI might not strictly need to play exactly 4 cards, but doing so could help increase my score. It's probably wise to play 4 cards to maintain a pair and avoid wasting cards. However, base hand scoring only counts the cards that form the pair. If I play 4 cards with a pair plus 2 extras, those extras won’t affect the chip count or trigger their effects, but they'll still be counted as played cards. This aligns well with the square joker growth condition! I need to consider my scoring goals better.\n**Calculating potential score**\n\nI see that the acrobat effect only triggers on the final hand, so if the big blind had multiple hands, that might not count. However, if the last hand was a three of a kind, I could potentially score there. For the boss, I could achieve x3 on that hand, which is crucial for reaching 20k.  \n\nIf I calculate the scoring for a pair of Aces, I get 240 chips, and with my multipliers, that could bring me to just over 20k! So it looks like the pair of Aces would exactly meet my goal!\n**Exploring chip calculations**\n\nI’m examining different pairs to see their chip values, starting with a pair of kings, which totals 19992 chips—just shy of my goal. Pairing down to queens and jacks, I come up similarly short, and a pair of nines is even lower. I need either a pair of aces or to hit three of a kind for a higher score. \n\nIf I go for three of a kind, the base chips would be 50 with a multiplier of 5, plus enhancements. It looks like I should get those pair bonuses as it meets the criteria for duo and acrobat effects.\n**Planning game moves**\n\nI’ve calculated a total of 255 chips for my three of a kind, which can comfortably exceed my goal. I realize I can only play one hand in the boss round, and while discards are available, I can’t play multiple hands. The grabber allows an extra hand, but the boss limits me back to one.  \n\nTo maximize my chances of getting a pair of Aces or three of a kind, I need a careful strategy. I’m also considering selling my credit card, but there’s uncertainty about whether that’s allowed while in debt, so it might be safer to keep it for potential future purchases. Overall, my next step is to play the round as instructed!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
