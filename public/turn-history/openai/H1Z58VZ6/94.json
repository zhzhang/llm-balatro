{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchase strategy**\n\nI’m considering my purchases and think I might reroll the shop after grabbing some freebies to find better jokers or vouchers. However, rerolling costs $5, which might be worth it. First, I’ll take the freebies: the Runner and Standard pack. With the Runner, I'll reach a joker capacity of 5, but that could block future jokers unless I sell something, which I might need to consider later. For now, I'll focus on getting the Runner for free!\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI'm considering the future need for a credit card for debt, but it would take up a slot too. For now, I’ll choose the Runner as my fifth card. After that, I can still open the Standard pack. My action plan is to buy the Runner card. I just need to ensure the command is correct: it should be buy_card for shop cards. Now, I’ll produce the necessary JSON for this!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
