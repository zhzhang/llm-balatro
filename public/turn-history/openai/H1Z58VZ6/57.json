{"reasoning":"**Calculating chips and score**\n\nI'm figuring out the total chips involved: I have 5 base chips, then adding ace11, scholar20, blue90, and square with 12 chips. It seems that the square joker gives me an extra +4 chips if I have exactly 4 cards, potentially +12 independent chips. Overall, I calculate the total to be around 138 chips, and with a multiplier of 15, my total score would be 2070. Also, I need to verify how drawing cards affects the deck count.\n**Clarifying deck mechanics**\n\nI'm considering how the deck size affects scoring, currently with 45 cards. After I play one card and draw another, the deck reduces to 44, but scoring occurs before I draw. So, I use the previous count of 45 remaining cards at that time. I've managed to tally up a score of 2070, needing 2930 more to reach 5000. I'll aim for strong hands and try to play exactly 4 cards to maximize my square benefits!\n**Evaluating hand possibilities**\n\nI see that I can gain +4 chips if I play exactly 4 cards in a hand later. For scoring, pairing is crucial (level 3 base with 40 chips and a base multiplier of 4). If I have a duo, it doubles that multiplier, plus I get an additional +10 from the square. \n\nLooking at my hand, I've got a pair of Jacks, which is a good start! I can play those along with two other cards. It's important to keep in mind that only the two Jacks count toward the pair, but if I play 4 cards, I trigger the square benefits as well.\n**Choosing cards for play**\n\nI realized that even if I have a pair, I can still play 4 cards. I can use the two Jacks plus two throwaways, which will trigger the square scaling for an additional +4 chips, increasing to 16. \n\nBut which cards should I use as throwaways? It’s a bit of a puzzle. I’m considering possibilities for future hands or thinning the deck. \n\nCurrently, aiming for a flush or straight isn’t feasible with my hand, so focusing on the pair of Jacks seems best for now, gaining those base chips.\n**Calculating total chips and action**\n\nI’m starting with total chips of 60 and adding 90 from blue and 16 from the square, which gives me 166 chips. The multiplier from the base and square will be 14, doubled to 28 with the duo, making my total score 4648. That exceeds the needed 2930 for the next hand.\n\nI need to ensure that the square’s chips get applied correctly. For the first hand, I’ll just play the Ace, aiming for around 2000 in chip value. I'll format the action as JSON now!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [8]"}
