{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nOkay, the left-to-right order is essential, especially since Smiley triggers during card scoring and before independent jokers. The square plus ten multiplier triggers independently after being held, but the order among independent jokers shouldn't matter—additive and multiplicative actions are commutative. \n\nBlue gives additional chips, and since that’s also commutative, there's no need to rearrange anything. My plan is to aim for 1600 chips using a high card 4-card strategy without discards. Let's move forward with the play round and output the necessary JSON action.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
