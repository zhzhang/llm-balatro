{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchasing options**\n\nI'm looking at my current shop situation after using the Magician card. Right now, I have Crazy Joker and Jumbo Arcana packs to consider, but my budget is tightly constrained. Crazy costs 4 and Jumbo costs 6, putting me further in the negative, which isn't allowed. Selling something could help me raise money. Selling blue brings me closer to a better position, but do I really want Crazy? Given my current build, it doesn't seem worth it. I should save my money and reorganize the jokers for scoring.\n**Revising joker activation order**\n\nI'm thinking about the activation order for independent jokers at step 5. I need to remember that the additive multiplier should come before the multiplicative ones. So, I'd calculate the square +10 first, followed by duo x2, then acrobat x3. It seems that the current order of blue, square, duo, credit card, and acrobat makes sense. The credit card doesn’t matter much here. I should keep additive multipliers earlier in the sequence, especially if I plan to add more later. Acrobat can remain flexible since it triggers on the final hand.\n**Rearranging joker order**\n\nOkay, I need to establish a safe order for my jokers: Blue, Square, Duo, Acrobat, and then Credit Card. I think it makes sense to go ahead and rearrange them since there's no cost involved. So, I’ll take the action to rearrange now. I can only submit one action, so the command will be \"rearrange_jokers\" followed by the indices of the new order: 1 for Blue, 2 for Square, 3 for Duo, 5 for Acrobat, and 4 for Credit Card.\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,5,4]"}
