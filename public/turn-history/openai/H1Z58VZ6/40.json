{"reasoning":"**Calculating card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the potential of playing just one card, focusing on high card with specific values. There are a few components to consider: the base card, the ace, chips from blue and square, and multipliers. If I play the ace correctly, it could indeed trigger a multiplier from the Scholar card, which is great. Overall, it looks like I could beat the blind with a well-placed single play yielding up to 2040 points. That's really exciting!\n**Verifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI need to check if the square card requires exactly four cards, but it seems not. It can still provide chip values, but leading with the ace might help me beat the blind right away. If I manage to win with just the ace, I could end up earning $3 from the remaining hands. But I need to confirm the scoring order and how the Blue Joker interacts with chip values. It looks like it adds chips without affecting multipliers, which is good to know!\n**Calculating potential scores**\n\nI calculated that 136 multiplied by 15 gives me 2040, but I realized the square card currently provides only 8 points instead of 12. So now my chip total is 132 with a multiplier of 15, which totals 1980—not enough! I considered playing the ace with a queen, but only the ace counts for scoring, meaning no change with the chips. To exceed 2000 in one hand, I think I might need to play a face card and trigger some multipliers. But so far, nothing's adding up!\n**Exploring card combinations**\n\nI'm considering starting with a two-pair of four cards to scale the square to 12, then following up with a high-card ace to hit 2040 points—quite the total! However, if I want to win in one hand, I could focus on playing exactly four cards with an ace, but I'm unsure about the scoring. It seems if I play four cards, the hand type might still be determined, but I'd need to confirm how high cards work in Balatro and what counts in my scoring.\n**Planning the card play**\n\nI'm confirming that I can play a hand with exactly four cards, which will scale the square and give me extra chips. My calculation for a high card ace yields a total of 2040 points, which is great! I need to make sure my cards are unique to avoid pairs and other hands. It seems that selecting an ace and three other non-pair cards will work. I’ll finalize my card choice and then format my action to play these specific cards for the best outcome. Let’s make sure everything is set for a successful play!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,5]"}
