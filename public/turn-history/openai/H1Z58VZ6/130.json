{"reasoning":"**Maximizing card order and strategy**\n\nI need to ensure the +10 multiplier from the holo square happens before Duo’s x2 and Acrobat’s x3 to maximize my score. Blue adds chips but that’s irrelevant. So the order is: Blue, Square, Duo, Acrobat, and Credit Card last. The Credit Card doesn’t impact scoring, so that’s fine. \n\nI could rearrange my strategy, but we need chips soon, and buying an Arcana pack for Tarot might help, though I have no money. Selling a joker could help but they’re essential to my deck.\n**Evaluating options for purchases and strategy**\n\nIf I sell the credit card for $1, my balance goes to -14, and the debt limit is removed, but I still can’t buy what I need, like the pack cost of 6. \n\nA better option is to buy the Arcana pack for $4, dropping my balance to -19, which is within limits. This pack could give me useful tarot cards like Death or Strength to duplicate valuable cards, though there’s risk. Since we’re in the shop just before facing the boss, investing now might help. I have 3 antes left, so scaling is crucial. Alternatively, I could reroll for the chance of finding something better, but that might not be wise with my current debt situation.\n**Deciding on purchases and strategy**\n\nI think the best action right now is to buy the Arcana pack to hopefully upgrade my deck, although I could also hold and select rounds. I need to consider my current strength; I barely beat the big blind with a 3-of-a-kind and ended up with 9.6k plus previous chips.\n\nI need to know that the boss blind will be higher, possibly around 40k. Acrobat will help my final hand, so I should focus on improving my deck with the Arcana pack. It could give me cards like the Hermit or Temperance, which may help me get out of debt. Plus, I can choose one of three tarot cards to use right away.\n**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nIt looks like I need to make choices about buying a booster to open the Arcana pack. Buying booster 1 for $4 is a straightforward action, but I could also consider the Jumbo pack, although I can’t afford it due to my debt situation. Selling the Blue joker could help, but even then, I’d still be under the limit for Jumbo. \n\nIf I sell the credit card for $1, that would put me in a better position to buy Jumbo, as long as it doesn’t remove my debt limit. I should explore that option further.\n**Deciding on purchases and rearrangements**\n\nI’m considering selling the Blue joker for $4, which would put my balance at -11, allowing me to buy Jumbo for -17, but that would cost me valuable chips. Selling the credit card could help, but maybe I should hold onto that. If I sell the Square for $5, I’d be at -10, but I need it. It seems like going for the regular Arcana pack is the best option. \n\nAfter that purchase, I’ll have to select tarot cards for immediate use, maybe even rearranging jokers. Though I should prioritize the order since it affects my score. It looks like the current order can stay the same, but I’ll make sure to buy the Arcana pack while ensuring I have consumable space. Let's follow through with that action!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
