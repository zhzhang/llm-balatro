{"reasoning":"**Weighing options for purchases**\n\nI'm in a shop with $3, but I can't afford items costing $4. My choices are either to select an item blindly or sell a joker to afford something. Selling a joker could give me $4-5, which would allow a purchase. I need to consider the value of my current jokers: the DNA joker is rare and useful for copying, and the Blue Joker benefits from a larger deck. Plus, the Square joker adds bonuses too. It feels like I've got some strong contenders to weigh before deciding!\n**Clarifying joker effects**\n\nThe card indicates a secondary description that gives a +10 multiplier, and I think the holographic edition adds another +10 multiplier. In Balatro, the holographic edition does add +10, while the Square joker inherently includes a +10 multiplier as well. So, it seems like combined, I might be looking at a total of +20 multipliers. I'm a bit confused about the base effects and chips, but the Square Joker does clarify it gains +4 chips if played with a four-card hand. I need to keep all this in mind!\n**Examining card options**\n\nFor the Square joker, I think that the \"Secondary Description: +10 Mult\" is likely from its holographic edition. This means Square is primarily about scaling chips while the holo adds the multiplier. The shop offers a Walkie Talkie and a Business Card, both at $4. The Walkie Talkie can be powerful since it boosts chips and multipliers with played 10s or 4s. We have a few of those in the deck, which could definitely be useful. The Business Card helps with money but isn't as essential since we have strong scaling. I’m considering whether swapping a joker, like DNA, for the Business Card makes sense.\n**Assessing joker value**\n\nI’m realizing that the DNA joker might not be very useful since we often play 4-5 cards, and its ability to copy a single card in the first hand is somewhat limited. However, it can help create duplicates of valuable enhanced cards if we manage to acquire them. The DNA joker increases the deck size, boosting the Blue Joker's output, which is a significant synergy. Each new card adds +2 chips to every hand. I think I should hold onto the DNA joker and consider selling something else, like the Square Joker.\n**Deciding joker strategy**\n\nThe Square joker seems to provide valuable scaling chips and a potential holo bonus. However, it triggers only with 4-card hands, while I need 5 cards for a straight to activate the Order x3. It looks like focusing on straights makes Square less essential, but its +10 multiplier is significant. I'll need to consider whether to keep it or swap for the Walkie Talkie or Business Card. Ultimately, I find it best to hold onto the current set and go for the next round. \n\nSince we’re stuck without sales, I’ll proceed with my plan and focus on activating the highest potential jokers in order: DNA first, then Blue Joker for chips, followed by Square for the multiplier, and finally the Duo and Order for their x multipliers. I’ll go ahead and execute the round_select action.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
