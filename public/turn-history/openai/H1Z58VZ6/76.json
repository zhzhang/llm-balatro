{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Square Joker mechanics**\n\nFor Square Joker, the base effect involves chip scaling and not multiplication. The +10 multiplier comes from the holo edition, so the current chip value of 20 acts as the independent additive chips. I see that playing a hand with a pair will yield a duo multiplier and potentially trigger a threefold multiplier with a straight. I can play the pair of 4s along with two other cards to get the bonus chips, but only the pair will count towards scoring.\n**Calculating potential hand scores**\n\nUnless I manage to create two pairs from unknowns, I can choose cards 3, 6, along with possibly an Ace and King for higher chips. However, those won't score unless they form a better hand like two pairs. It seems simpler to play just the pair with two cards. But to gain from the square, I need to select four cards. By doing so, my pair chips total to 140, with a multiplier of 14. So once I apply the duo multiplier, I can reach 28!\n**Evaluating hand options and scores**\n\nThe order isn't active right now, but holding the Steel card, like the 2 of Hearts, can trigger a 1.5 multiplier if I don't play it. If I play four cards while keeping Steel, the multiplier would be 42, leading to a score of 5880, which is great since it exceeds 2736. The Blue Joker bonus chips apply independently, so my chip total of 140 is fine. However, only the pair cards contribute chips, totaling 48 after considering base chips.\n**Examining hand combinations**\n\nI’m considering if I can create a higher hand type, like two pairs, but that doesn't seem possible. Including an Ace and Jack might not help either. If the unknown card is a 4, I can potentially form three of a kind, which would give me a base of 50 chips and a multiplier of 5. That composition would trigger a duo since it contains a pair, which is good! However, I can't trigger the Order because there's no straight possible. Risky play, indeed!\n**Strategizing for the hand play**\n\nI think it’s better to create a pair hand using exactly four cards to boost the square and keep the Steel card in hand. I plan to play the pair of 4s along with an Ace and a King as kickers. If I do this, the Square Joker should gain +4 chips permanently, increasing the value before scoring to 24 chips. Although the hands must be managed carefully, I want to ensure I don’t play high cards unnecessarily, leaning towards playing lower-value kickers. I’ll choose to keep some options for later rounds, balancing risk and potential scoring.\n**Calculating optimal plays and score**\n\nI'm evaluating how to maximize my score, especially considering the possibility of forming four of a kind. If I achieve this, I’d have base chips of 60 with a 7x multiplier. Even with unknown cards, I'll always have at least a pair. I think I'll keep the Steel card in hand for its multiplier but may avoid playing high cards like the Ace or King to keep options open. After considering the order of jokers and their effects on scoring, it seems I should expect a final score around 4608, which is solid!\n**Planning for optimal play**\n\nIn this scenario, only the pair chips contribute to the score, meaning the kickers won’t add their values or trigger any jokers. So, I confirmed that the total is 48 from the pair. I think if we play four cards, it can help increase the Square's value. I’ll select cards 1 (Ace of Hearts), 2 (Jack of Hearts), 3 (4 of Hearts), and 6 (4 of Clubs) to trigger growth. I’ll keep the Steel card in hand and estimate the chips around 4500.
