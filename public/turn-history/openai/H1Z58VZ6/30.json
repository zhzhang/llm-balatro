{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm considering putting a face card, possibly the Queen or Jack, since Smiley grants a +5 multiplier when that card scores. I'm aiming for 4-card plays to scale Square. If glass is on a face card in my hand, does it double the multiplier after scoring? \n\nBut there's a risk of a 25% chance of destruction when played. Losing cards reduces the deck size, which impacts the Blue Joker's value. Keeping a larger deck is essential, so the glass risk may not be worth it.\n**Considering card strategies**\n\nI'm pondering which boss to go with; it could be one that sets discards to zero. However, holding onto a gold card can give us an economic boost of $3 if we win and play other cards. Since I often win with one hand, keeping a gold card in hand is strong. \n\nI think about using a card like 3♦ that can stay unplayed while I still maintain my strategy to play 4 cards. I realize I can play up to 5 cards, so I could keep the gold card among four unplayed. This way, it triggers the end of the round without risking destruction or reducing my deck size. Plus, I can enhance the rank of up to 2 cards with 3 Strength.\n**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about how useful it is to create higher ranks or pairs. With Smiley and face cards, I could increase a 9 to a 10 or turn 9 hearts into 10 hearts, but those changes aren't massive. However, with Strength, I could make a 7 an 8. \n\nMy strategy relies on Blue Joker chips and leveraging Square's +10 multiplier with Smiley for face cards. I can win blinds using high cards in a 4-card hand. The Gift Card boosts sell value, while the Red Card is currently useless. I'm low on cash and need a steady income, so I’ll choose to apply the Gold card (Devil) to a low card I plan to keep. I suspect this \"Hand\" in TAROT_PACK reflects the current deck hand in the shop.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nIn Balatro, when using tarot in the shop, I select a card from a displayed hand of 8. This might be part of my current hand at the start of the next round, which is fine. I could make 3♦ a gold card since it’s easy to maintain. \n\nEven though there’s a risk of accidentally drawing it later, the enhancement stays on that card. If I keep it at the end of the round, I can earn $3. If I use Justice on the Queen, I could gain a x2 multiplier with Smiley triggers and Square’s +10, leading to significant scoring. However, the risk of destruction could permanently reduce my deck size and scoring potential.\n**Assessing early game strategy**\n\nI think taking risks might be acceptable, but in the early game, I’d prefer a stable economy. Strength could increase a 9 to a 10, potentially creating a 10 pair, but that isn’t huge. \n\nGiven the Blue Joker at +88, my deck size is currently 44. This might suggest my deck isn't full at 52 because of previous plays. Losing a card reduces my chips by only 2, which isn’t catastrophic. I’ll focus on the future economy by picking the Devil. I need to target a low rank card, likely choosing the 3♦ at position 8. It’s crucial to select carefully, ensuring I keep my strategy intact while making this selection.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,8]"}
