{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m in the shop with $5 to spend. I see some options: the Strength tarot at $3, Walkie Talkie joker at $4, and both the Celestial and Buffoon packs at $4. There's also a telescope voucher for $10, which I can't afford. If I reroll, it costs $5, but I’m considering whether that’s worth it. My jokers are maxed at five, and buying the Walkie Talkie would require selling one. It has significant scoring potential, especially with 10s and 4s in play.\n**Analyzing deck and options**\n\nI’m noticing that the Blue Joker, which offers +110 chips, suggests there are 55 cards left in the deck. However, I remember my earlier count being 31 after a round, which might reset the deck to 52—though it could've increased with new cards. It seems plausible that the +110 is accurate since it factors in the draw pile size. My current strategy involves playing 4-card hands to maximize the Square and earn big chips. I’m considering the Buffoon pack for another joker, but it costs $4, leaving me with $1 left to play with.\n**Considering pack options**\n\nI’m thinking about the Celestial pack for leveling up pairs since pairs are frequently played, which could mean it contains useful cards. Without the Telescope, my choices are random among three options. I could buy either the Strength tarot, which might rank up to two cards, but I need to remember it's consumable and doesn't help immediately since I have no current consumables. I could spend $3 on Strength and still have $2 left, or go for the $4 booster pack. The Walkie Talkie might also fit well with 4-card hands, activating on 10s or 4s played, but I need to ensure those cards participate in the highest hands to score.\n**Assessing scoring strategies**\n\nI realize if I play pairs with filler cards that aren't part of the pair, those fillers won't score or trigger the Walkie Talkie. So, for Walkie Talkie to be effective, 10s or 4s need to be in the best hand, like pairs of 10s or 4s, or within straights or flushes. Since my main strategy is pairs, the Walkie Talkie might not add enough value. I might be better off opening the Buffoon pack for a joker that can scale my multipliers, but I’m at joker capacity. I could sell either the Credit Card or Wily to make room for better options.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m considering the Credit Card, which sells for $1 and allows for debt, but since I’m low on economy, I might keep it for necessary purchases. I can buy items even if I go negative as long as I stay above -20, so I could get both the Buffoon and Celestial packs. The Celestial pack likely includes Mercury, which upgrades my pair, and that would be beneficial. I think my best action here is to buy the Celestial pack for guaranteed improvement. So, I’ll choose to buy_booster 1.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
