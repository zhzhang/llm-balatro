{"reasoning":"**Making shopping decisions**\n\nI'm looking at my current options in the shop with just $4 to spend. The items are all out of my price range: Ride the Bus for $6, Mega Standard for $8, and Telescope for $10. Rerolling costs $5, which I can't afford either. The best choice seems to be moving on without buying anything. I could sell some items to afford something, but I'd prefer to keep both items I have, so I'll just leave the shop.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
