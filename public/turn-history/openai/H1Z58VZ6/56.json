{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about the small blind ante situation where I need 5000. If I skip, I might lose the chance to shop later, but it also means I wouldn't play this round. However, proceeding with a skip allows me to move to the next blind selection, which is tricky because skipping the small blind might also affect the big blind. Plus, while I currently have full joker slots, I need to carefully consider before selling any to make space for new items. Skipping would mean losing rewards from gameplay, so there's a lot to weigh here!\n**Reevaluating game strategy**\n\nI realize rewards come after winning, so the $3 could be useful. I might easily beat the small blind, given my scoring of 2000-3000 in the last ante; however, I need 5000 chips now. My current build increases chips, with multipliers and bonuses like from Blue and Square, and the Grabber helps with an extra hand. I think playing small could let me earn the $3 for shopping, but skipping might impact the next shop opportunity. The tag situation is a bit tricky, as it applies after winning.\n**Analyzing shop opportunities**\n\nIf I skip the small blind, I won't get a chance to shop and will move directly to the big. By playing the big blind, if I win, I can shop for a free uncommon joker, which sounds great! However, skipping the small means missing that shop entirely. At the moment, I can’t buy anything with just $3. Winning the small could net me $3, which might bump up to $6, but it feels more beneficial to take the uncommon joker tag instead. I just need to weigh the options carefully!\n**Evaluating buying options**\n\nI might be able to reach $7-8, which would let me buy either the standard pack or the To Do List. The To Do List could give me +50 chips and $4 for a full house, though that’s tricky to achieve. I’d need to consider selling a weaker joker like the Scholar or Square to make room, but the Scholar's multiplier potential is valuable. Skipping the small blind means keeping $3 and going straight to the big blind, potentially allowing me to shop later with the uncommon joker. But, with just $3, I’m not losing much by skipping.\n**Deciding between options**\n\nSkipping the small blind means losing out on potential rewards like the $3 plus interest, which could be significant. While the uncommon joker tag has value, it might require selling another joker, which isn’t ideal. \n\nProgressing through the rounds, playing the small blind offers good opportunities for a DNA clone and cash. I can clone a valuable card like an Ace, enhancing my strategy. Overall, playing small seems better, yielding cash and the chance for a DNA clone while still allowing a potential shop visit. So, I’m set to play the round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
