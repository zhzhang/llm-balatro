{"reasoning":"**Examining card combinations**\n\nThe Order and Duo can provide large multipliers, but I can't have a pair and a straight simultaneously—unless the straight contains the pair, which it doesn't. So, for straight hands, the Duo doesn’t apply. In pair hands, the Order doesn’t apply either, but I could keep both for flexibility yet focus on specialties. Also, the Square only triggers with exactly 4 cards. I often play a 4-card pair or three of a kind, but the Square needs exact hand size.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI often play 4 cards to trigger the Square while also making a pair, which scores chips and multipliers. So, I definitely want to keep the Square. Now, deciding which joker to sell is tricky. The credit card is low impact but crucial for the economy. The Showman lets me find duplicates later, but at $5, I need to sell something to buy, leaving just $1, which isn't ideal. Wily could replace Order if we focus on full houses or three of a kind. Since a full house contains three of a kind, Wily would trigger when I play that hand type too! That's a solid bonus of +100 chips flat.\n**Evaluating hand strategies**\n\nI’m comparing the Order's x3 multiplier on straights. Our straights score around 7k with Order. Wait, the last straight was 7056 chips, but not using Duo. If I drop Order, straights weaken, but there are other options like full houses and pairs. Wily gives +100 chips, while the blue adds +110. The Square contributes +32 and a +10 multiplier, and the Duo also works on full houses since they contain pairs. \n\nRemoving Order for Wily focuses on consistent chips for full houses and pairing, which likely beats the situational straight multiplier, especially since we rarely play straights at level one. And since the Square encourages 4-card hands, it doesn’t really align with the 5-card requirement for straights. So, Order might not be worth it anymore.\n**Deciding on card sales and purchases**\n\nI think selling Order for $4 and buying Wily for the same amount is a solid move. That keeps my net money at $6, which feels good. I wonder about the Showman; it might not be worth it since I can't score immediately after getting it. If I sell Order, I could buy Wily, but I can only take one action at a time. I need to sell first to make space for Wily, so my next action should be selling Order. I don't think I’d regret this since Wily will still be available after the sale.\n**Making strategic card changes**\n\nI don't see any risk in selling Order since I’ll have enough money. So, let’s go ahead and sell it. I'm also considering rearranging my card order for scoring. For independent jokers, I think the additive multipliers should come before the multiplicative ones. Blue and Wily add chips, and the Square gives chips with a +10 multiplier, while Duo offers a x2 multiplier. \n\nSo, to keep the optimal order, I’d want Square before Duo for the best effect, and Credit Card doesn’t contribute anything. Once I sell Order and add Wily, a potential order could be: Blue, Wily, Square, and Duo. For now, action: sell Order.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
