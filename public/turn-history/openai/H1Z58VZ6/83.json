{"reasoning":"**Deciding on gameplay strategy**\n\nI need to figure out whether to play or skip the Big Blind for the economy tag. I've got a coupon guaranteeing free initial cards and booster packs at the next shop. If I skip the Big Blind, I can get the economy tag, which would double my current $1 to $2— but that seems pretty useless. But I remember that economy tags apply immediately when I skip the blind! Playing gives me the $4 reward and access to the shop before facing the boss, so skipping may not be worth it.\n**Evaluating shop strategy**\n\nI think that shop is really important for picking up consumables and jokers. The coupon will get us free initial cards and boosters in the next shop. If we play big, we enter the shop after the Big Blind, which means the coupon applies there—great! So I should play big to use the coupon, grab $4, and get free initial cards and boosters. If I skip big, I’d miss the shop and the $4, plus the economy tag doesn't matter. I’m leaning toward playing!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
