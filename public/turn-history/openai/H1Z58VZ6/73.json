{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Square Joker mechanics**\n\nI’m trying to sort through the mechanics of the Square Joker, specifically its \"gains +4 chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards\" feature. It seems like this chip gain is separate and permanent, possibly scaling with its current value. But I'm uncertain about how it interacts with the current hand and if it adds chips each time. I'm revisiting the mechanics in Balatro to clarify if it gives chips more than once per hand. There’s definitely some confusion here!\n**Clarifying Square Joker mechanics**\n\nI'm looking at the Square Joker's mechanics again. It gives +4 chips when the hand has exactly 4 cards, and this bonus seems to be permanent, contributing to each hand's score. The holo edition adds a +10 multiplier, but I'm a bit puzzled about how these multipliers interact. It looks like I should prioritize adding multipliers before applying any multiplication effects to maximize gains. Arranging the +mult jokers earlier and having the duo and order multipliers at the end feels like the best strategy.\n**Understanding chip and multiplier interactions**\n\nI'm analyzing the roles of various jokers in the game. The Blue Joker adds chips but doesn't affect multipliers, so their order isn't crucial. The Square Joker does provide a +mult bonus, especially in holo form, and should ideally be placed before x multipliers to maximize gains. DNA has an ability related to single cards but doesn't provide scoring benefits, so I wonder if it can be used to copy a powerful card. For the boss battle, I think I’ll need a couple of hands to reach the required score.\n**Strategizing for the boss battle**\n\nI’m considering the challenges for the boss due to the face-down draw, yet I can still utilize straights and pairs. To maximize scoring, I think I should order the jokers strategically: putting the Square Joker before Duo and Order, along with its holographic +10 multiplier and potential chip bonus. The best order looks like DNA, Blue, Square, Duo, and Order. Since the Blue Joker is for chips, its placement isn't crucial. Now, I’ll finalize by proceeding to play the round and format my action in JSON.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
