{"reasoning":"**Considering shop expenses**\n\nI need to think about whether we need money for the shop, since buying Wraith sets our money to zero, meaning we can't buy anything else. We've already committed by purchasing a pack, though. If we skip the booster, we can retain $4, but I’d prefer to go for Wraith instead. Even if the rare joker could score big, the loss of $4 isn’t significant in the long run. So, I’ll select Wraith, keeping an open slot with 4 jokers.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
