{"reasoning":"**Considering DNA strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about how DNA can help in copying Aces each round, specifically boosting Ace high cards or pairs. The plan is to play the 1-card Ace first in each round and then copy it. For stronger plays, like with big/boss cards, we might need more chips or perhaps a pair of Aces. So, yes, I should buy DNA now. Also, the order of jokers matters, but the action is to buy the card now.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
