{"reasoning":"**Deciding on card options**\n\nI'm in shop ante 3 and have $8 to spend. The Jokers are full, and I’m weighing my options: I can get Magician tarot for $3, or Jumbo Celestial for $6. My current build is strong, thanks to scaling from Blue Joker. The Square Joker helps with four-card hands, which we often play. Scholar boosts Aces nicely, while Gift Card helps economy but doesn't score well. I can buy Jumbo Celestial plus Magician or Standard plus Magician.\n**Considering card packs**\n\nI’m considering the Celestial pack, which might include Uranus, the Two Pair planet in Balatro. If I get it, it could boost base chips and multipliers, but without the Telescope, it's uncertain. The Jumbo pack offers up to 5 planets, likely with something useful, while the Standard pack just adds a playing card, which might not help early on. Magician creates Lucky cards, but I can't use them since I lack target cards. I should prioritize the Jumbo Celestial pack for $6 to improve my base for hands like Two Pair or Flush.\n**Deciding on booster purchase**\n\nIt seems our highest scores came from High Card, thanks to the huge chips and multipliers; like a score of 1712! With the current Jokers, playing a 4-card High Card might only use one card for scoring. However, I see that improving Two Pair could be beneficial. I plan to buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack right away. After that, I can select a planet, though the game doesn't show that now. After purchasing, I’ll have $2 left and can only hold off on buying anything else for later. So, my next action is to buy the booster!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
