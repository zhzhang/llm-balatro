{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game offers**\n\nI'm in the shop with $13 and a maximum of 5 jokers, currently holding 4. There’s a rare free offer for The Duo, which doubles my multiplier if my hand contains a Pair. This could pair well with other boosts, leading to a significant final multiplier. I think I’ll go for it.  \n\nThere's also the To Do List foil that grants +50 chips and $4 when I have a Full House. It seems less strong initially, but those extra chips can really add up!\n**Assessing game purchases**\n\nThe To Do List foil adds an independent +50 chips, alongside the base effect of earning $4 for specific hands. It costs $6, so it might be decent but not essential. I have options like Blue, Square, Scholar, and DNA in my deck. The Duo encourages playing pairs, but getting a Full House can be tough. I could spend $10 on the Voucher Grabber for an extra hand each round, which seems very valuable.  \n\nI can buy Grabber and The Duo since I only have $13, but not the To Do List or boosters.\n**Deciding on purchases and arrangement**\n\nI'm considering buying the Voucher Grabber along with the Jumbo Celestial card. If I skip the Grabber, I could go for the Celestial and To Do List instead. But since the Grabber gives an extra hand, it's top priority, especially since my scoring depends on high cards and flushes. \n\nI also want to think about the order of my jokers; it matters for some triggers. Square needs to be before the Duo to maximize the multiplier benefits.\n**Arranging jokers for optimal effect**\n\nIf Square adds a multiplier, then Duo’s x2 multiplier works well after it. Scholar contributes +4 multiplier for each Ace, activating before the Duo in scoring order. I want to ensure the Duo is placed last among independent multipliers. \n\nNow, for the ordering: DNA should be first among jokers to trigger since it activates on played cards. My current arrangement is Square, Blue, Scholar, and DNA, but that means DNA triggers after the others. I should ensure Square comes before Blue and Scholar in Category 5.\n**Planning actions and joker arrangement**\n\nI realized that Scholar is in the scored category (3), not category (5). In category (5), I’ll prioritize independent activations with Square (+10 mult), Blue (+chips), and Duo (x2 mult). \n\nI think having DNA first for clarity is the way to go, and the order can be DNA, Scholar, Blue, Square, Duo. After buying The Duo, I’ll have five jokers, allowing me to buy Voucher Grabber too. I should execute \"buy_card\" for position 1 first before making other actions.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
