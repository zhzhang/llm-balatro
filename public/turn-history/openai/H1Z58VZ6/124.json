{"reasoning":"**Optimizing game strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing a game scenario where I add 52 chips, and it scales by +4 when playing 4 cards. Playing 4-card hands seems effective for scaling my score, potentially using pairs with a historical score of around 4.6k. I need to reach 30k chips and might require 6 hands since I have 5. However, if pairs yield 5k, that could assist. With the deck size having changed, I need to optimize my strategy to reach that score effectively.\n**Evaluating hand strategies**\n\nI'm considering whether a full house or a flush could yield more chips. My current build is optimized for pairs, especially since a full house requires a pair, which triggers my duo. A full house provides a higher base yield than a simple pair. Currently, I have a pair of kings in hand along with other cards. I should calculate if 30k can be achieved in 5 hands using the scoring formula, specifically the base and additional chip values.\n**Applying joker values**\n\nI'm calculating the impact of the jokers on my hands. The blue joker adds +94 chips, while the green joker gives +50 chips and has an interesting multiplier aspect, gaining +1 multiplier per hand played and losing -1 per discard. The square adds +52 chips and contributes +20 to the multiplier. The duo doubles the multiplier if there's a pair. Before applying the multiplier, my total chip count is 256. It’s essential to keep track of these increments as I play.\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m wondering if the square’s scaling of +4 chips applies immediately or afterward. It seems like it might increase by the end of the hand without affecting the current scoring, so I’ll set that aside for now. For multipliers, I start with a base multiplier of 4, add the square’s +20 for a total of 24, and the green gives me +0. Then, I apply the duo multiplier to get 48. So, my total chips would come to 12,288, which is much higher than I first calculated. I need to reconsider if the base numbers or multipliers might’ve been misapplied earlier.\n**Analyzing multiplier factors**\n\nI'm pondering whether the square's +10 multiplier applies only when exactly 4 cards are played, just as its +4 chips do. The dependency on having 4 cards seems to be significant for its effectiveness. My total multiplier is currently at 48, and I need to understand how these jokers are interacting. The green joker adds a multiplier based on hands played, while the blue joker chips depend on remaining cards. There's a lot to consider, like whether the duo triggers correctly for pairs and how each joker's contributions add up. I might be miscalculating earlier results, so exploring these details is important to ensure accurate scoring.\n**Evaluating scoring strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing how the green multiplier affects scoring throughout different hands and whether various jokers are contributing correctly. If I think green adds +1 each hand, and my base multiplier is around 7, then the duo could double the effect, potentially raising my chips significantly. I'm also considering the blue joker and its impact on chips for each remaining card, which could lead to enormous additions. It’s crucial to maximize my hands since I need to reach at least 30k with those five hands, and it looks like I'll need to aim for roughly 6k per hand to succeed.\n**Planning for optimal scoring**\n\nI'm thinking about how to maximize my score by utilizing the green multiplier throughout the hands. Playing five hands without discarding should help increase the green multiplier. I already have a scoring pair with the kings, and I need to ensure I play four cards to trigger the square scaling effectively. I'm also contemplating my remaining cards and trying to balance the need for high-value cards while avoiding discards until the end of the round. Maintaining the gold card to ensure those extra $3 is critical, so I won't play it. The goal is to score high and keep an eye on the potential for future pairs and flushes.\n**Refining scoring calculations**\n\nI'm examining how the blue and green multipliers impact my scoring potential. With the blue score now at 94, it requires adjustments to my chip calculations. My previous estimated multiplier was 24 for around 4800 chips, but I need to reassess this, potentially factoring in different effects from jokers. The Square Joker mainly scales chips and doesn't provide a multiplier unless exactly four cards are played, which is crucial for my strategy. I need to balance the green and blue effects while keeping track of my actual hand's status.\n**Evaluating hand strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing the Square Joker's effect, which gains +4 chips with exactly four cards in play. Although it applies its current chip value in scoring, I suspect my multiplier might be too high. With 4800 as a score, I need to explore if my current multipliers and chip values are accurate. I should consider strategies like focusing on three of a kind or full houses to boost points, as they have higher base multipliers. The key is to maximize my scoring potential while keeping track of chip gains.\n**Planning optimal play**\n\nI realize that extra cards don’t contribute to square scaling, which depends on four-card hands. However, while I consider a full house with five cards, I need to focus on winning in this big blind situation. For the current hand, since it includes a pair of kings, my best course of action is to play a four-card pair. I’ll choose to play the Kings and two other low cards, keeping the gold card. My estimate for scoring is around 6000. Now I'll format my response in JSON.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,4,1,7]"}
