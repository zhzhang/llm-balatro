{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m considering the power of Acrobat in the game, as we typically have multiple hands, but the final hand’s multiplier can be significant. However, I have five joker slots filled, and I’d need to sell something, likely the credit card since it's not very valuable. Selling it may mean I can’t go below -20, and with my current situation at -12, I wonder if I can still operate without it. I'm uncertain about how it affects my buying capability!\n**Assessing joker strategy**\n\nI’m thinking it’s best to hold onto what I have for now since I need to shop. However, if I want to add a new joker, I’d need to sell one of my existing jokers. The Crazy Joker is limited to straights, but I'm focused on pairs or three-of-a-kind at the moment. Acrobat looks really strong, especially with the multipliers. I wonder if I should replace the Green joker, even though it’s scaling well. The Square joker has some nice benefits too, making it a tough call!\n**Considering joker abilities**\n\nI’m evaluating the Square joker, which gains +4 chips when I play a hand with exactly four cards, and it provides a +10 multiplier from its edition. I think I should keep it. The Green joker offers some nice scaling and foil benefits too. Now I'm pondering whether to replace the credit card with Acrobat. Selling the credit card might limit my ability to purchase while in debt. Maybe I can buy Acrobat first and then sell the credit card later, but that does complicate things!\n**Evaluating purchase strategy**\n\nI’m considering selling the credit card to buy Acrobat, but I'm worried about being unable to make purchases since I'm currently at -12. Without the credit card, I might not be able to spend. So, it seems better to buy Acrobat first? But I can't without an empty slot. Maybe selling another scoring joker is the way to go, and the Green Joker might be the one to sell, even though it offers a nice multiplier and chips every hand. Acrobat could be massive for the final hand, and I have more hands now with Grabber!\n**Planning joker actions**\n\nI'm weighing my options with the deck. My focus is on keeping the Square, Blue, and Duo jokers because they provide solid benefits. The Green Joker could be less essential, especially since I might want to sell it to buy Acrobat, which offers greater multipliers for the final hand. Selling the Green Joker will give me enough funds to buy Acrobat without going over my credit card limit. So, my first step is to sell the Green Joker! I'll set that action now.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
