{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI'm considering whether using two random commons is better than sticking with Order. While Order is rare, it's useful for straights. The boss effect of drawing seven cards face down could complicate things by hindering visibility, making it harder to create straights or pairs. Since our current funds are zero, playing the big blind could bring in $4. However, skipping would mean a loss of money. Selling a joker for room may seem necessary, but I'm not thrilled about losing Order.\n**Deciding game actions**\n\nIf I skip, I’ll still have zero money facing the boss with 10,000 chips. While money isn’t needed during the round, it matters for the shop later, so I think it's better to play the big blind. My plan is to play the round and maybe rearrange the jokers in the order of DNA, Blue, Square, Duo, and Order. Their activation order matters for multipliers, and I need to consider which joker triggers first and how they interact for scoring. Starting with DNA could be a good idea!\n**Understanding Square joker**\n\nI realized that the Square joker gains chips if there are exactly four cards, plus it provides a +10 multiplier. Whether those chips are independent or during gameplay is still unclear. In Balatro, the Square joker gives +4 chips if it’s played with exactly four cards, and it activates before scoring. Its chip contribution seems to be independent. Since the left-to-right order isn't crucial, I’ll keep my current plan and proceed with the action to play the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
