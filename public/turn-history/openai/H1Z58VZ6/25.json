{"reasoning":"**Exploring game mechanics**\n\nIt's interesting to think about the strategy of skipping small encounters versus going big. If I choose to skip small, then I land in a blind selection for the next big encounter, which can be a gamble. Skipping big means heading to a boss with a coupon, but without shopping first. The coupon allows for free initial cards and booster packs at the next shop, so it seems strategic to consider skipping both small and big for the best outcome later!\n**Analyzing boss strategy**\n\nSkipping both small and big encounters might leave me going into the boss fight with low money and no discards. That's tough because starting with zero discards makes it hard to beat the boss with 1600 needed. Having extra jokers from top-up could help! The coupon tag after skipping could lead to a free shop visit after the boss. I wonder if my current deck, with jokers like Smiley and Square, can handle that challenge.\n**Strategizing the encounter**\n\nI’m considering adding Smiley for some extra multipliers based on face cards. If I can score just 2 face cards, that gives me a +10 multiplier, bringing me to 26. With an average of 50 chips per hand, I could score around 85 chips. That could mean 2210 total, which is great, especially since I'm aiming for 1600! Although no discards makes achieving a flush tricky, I might still manage that across multiple hands. I think the best strategy is to skip small to get a top-up and improve my chances!\n**Deciding on the next action**\n\nSkipping the big encounter means I have to face the boss without the $4 and without a shop in between. However, having extra jokers from the top-up might compensate for that. On the other hand, playing big gives me $4 and a chance to shop before the boss, which could be important for buying items. Yet the coupon tag could provide even greater value with free initial items after the boss. I think I’ll choose to skip the big round for now to get the top-up tag!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
