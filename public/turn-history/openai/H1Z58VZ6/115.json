{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker options**\n\nI'm in a situation where I have to choose one joker from two options. We've got a limit of five jokers, and I need to sell one if I want to bring in a new one. The choices are the Mail-In Rebate, which earns $5 for each discarded 7, or the Faceless Joker, which gives me $5 for discarding three or more face cards at once. Given that we're in debt, I really need to make the best choice!\n**Weighing joker options**\n\nI think selling Wily is the best choice since it's the least consistent, and I can get $2 for it. Now, I need to decide between the Mail-In Rebate and the Faceless Joker. The Faceless Joker can trigger by discarding three face cards, which I could aim for with my discards. Meanwhile, the Mail-In Rebate relies on discarding a changing target rank, offering potential but also variability. I wonder if the Faceless option might be easier to maximize in my current situation!\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI can check my hand and discard cards during a round, where multiple discards can happen. Each discarded card can trigger a bonus, potentially earning me $5-15 if I have 1-3 of the target rank. The Faceless Joker only triggers once per discard, which isn’t as effective for earning money. It seems the Mail-In Rebate is better for my current economy, though it doesn't help with scoring. I still need cash to upgrade and buy more power, so I’ll go with the Mail-In option, but first, I need to sell Wily!\n**Planning next actions**\n\nI need to figure out my next move, focusing on whether I should sell a joker or select one first. It seems I can sell one joker and select a new card in the same turn. However, since the game typically expects one command per step, I'll play it safe and sell Wily first to free up a slot. After that, I’ll select the Mail-In. Selling my credit card isn’t an option because of my current debt. I should also avoid selling Blue or Duo, as that would hurt my strategy. I’ll keep Square since it’s central to my scoring!\n**Finalizing my move**\n\nI realize that Square has a consistent +10 multiplier, which is great, but its primary scaling only activates with exactly four cards. Since my earlier strategy focused on four-card hands, I should definitely keep it. So, it’s time to sell Wily, and then I'll choose the Mail-In next. I’ll go ahead and execute the command to sell the joker located at position 5 now. This should help free up space for my new card!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
