{"reasoning":"**Evaluating spending choices**\n\nI need to figure out my best action at the shop. Currently, I have -19 in cash and my credit card lets me go to -20, so I can spend up to $1. But if my debt limit is -20, that means after my purchase, I can’t go below -20. I see items like Crazy Joker for $4 and Jumbo Arcana for $6, but I can't purchase anything without selling something to raise funds. If I sell the credit card, I might lose the ability to go into further debt, but I’m unclear about the mechanics.\n**Strategizing for the boss fight**\n\nI’m currently in Ante 6, and I need power for the upcoming boss. My existing setup includes Square, Duo, and Acrobat. Crazy Joker doesn’t seem to fit my strategy, especially since it requires 4-card hands. I like Square because it gains chips and gives me a +10 multiplier, and with Pair level 3, I'm looking at some solid multipliers overall. Since I'm deep in debt, I should consider finding a way to earn money. Buying Jumbo Arcana might help, but it's tough since I can't afford much right now.\n**Deciding on sales for Jumbo purchase**\n\nI’m trying to figure out how to afford Jumbo. Selling a joker seems like an option, but which one? Maybe I should sell my Credit Card, but I’m still in debt. If I sell Blue for $4, I’d be at -15, but then I can’t buy Jumbo at $6 because of the debt limit of -20. If I sell both Blue and the Credit Card, I could get down to -20. I think keeping the Credit Card could let me buy while negative, so I have to be cautious. Selling Acrobat for $3 might also work out.\n**Weighing options for the boss fight**\n\nLosing Acrobat might hurt my scoring, so I need to think carefully about my options. Selling Blue for $4 and then buying Crazy could work, but I’d be at -19. Crazy adds a +12 multiplier for straights, which isn’t that significant. I could consider rerolling, but that would cost me $5, which I can’t afford right now. Instead, I should probably select my round and gear up for the boss fight. Although, selling something could help with my debt. Selling my Credit Card might break my buying ability, so I’ll reconsider that.\n**Assessing strategy and resources**\n\nBlue gives a significant chip boost, adding +110 to my base, but selling it might hurt my overall scoring. Acrobat is crucial too, yet it only matters for the final hand. I'm currently at ante 6 and need to prepare for the boss fight, but I have uncertainties about my scoring potential. Buying an arcana pack could help, especially with cards like Hermit or Temperance, but selling the Credit Card prematurely could backfire. I’m thinking selling Blue might be viable, but my ultimate action plan needs to be carefully sequenced due to my dire financial situation.\n**Evaluating sales and scoring potential**\n\nI need to make a strategic sale first. Selling Blue might be an option, but I think I could sell Square instead for $5 to reach -10, enabling a Jumbo buy at -16. However, Square is important with its +10 multiplier and chip increase. Upon examining my scoring, I see that if I remove Blue, my chip total drops significantly. It seems critical to keep Square, Duo, and Acrobat for a strong hand. Since I can't do anything productive now, choosing round_select seems like the best action moving forward.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
