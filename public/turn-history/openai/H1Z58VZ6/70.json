{"reasoning":"**Planning booster purchases**\n\nI’m considering that blue cards are advantageous, as they contribute +2 per remaining card in the deck at scoring time. So, DNA synergy aligns well with blue. I should keep jokers but focus on buying booster packs instead. I can purchase the Celestial Pack for $4 or the Standard Pack, but with only $7, I’ll prioritize Celestial since it enhances my chips. The reroll option for the shop doesn't seem beneficial, so I’ll go ahead and buy the Celestial Pack first!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
