{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop strategy**\n\nI'm stuck in a shop with $3, but the cheapest booster is $4, so I can't buy anything. My only option is to rearrange the jokers for optimal scoring. I need to think about the order of categories. For instance, DNA triggers category 2 and depends on the first hand of the round, but I wonder if it only needs one card. It seems jokers are triggered left-to-right; maybe I should play DNA early if other category 2 jokers are there. I need to consider all components carefully!\n**Organizing card strategy**\n\nSquare has scaling chips and an independent +10 multiplier from the holo edition, so it seems wise to play Square early in category 2. When gaining chips, the order might not matter. However, in category 5, I need to ensure the additive multipliers come before any multipliers from Duc. So I'll arrange things accordingly: Blue, which adds chips, does not interact with the multipliers. I'll also consider how Scholar's role affects scoring, ensuring it's positioned correctly for optimal benefits!\n**Rearranging jokers**\n\nI've decided on the order for the jokers: DNA, Scholar, Blue, Square, and Duo. While Blue is independent and doesn’t affect order, Scholar needs to be placed earlier if possible because it triggers only on aces, but it seems that doesn't change the overall game dynamics much. Since Blue adds chips based on the remaining deck, the order of Blue and Square doesn’t matter. I’ll rearrange the jokers to [DNA, Scholar, Blue, Square, Duo] and then proceed with the turn.\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [4,3,2,1,5]"}
