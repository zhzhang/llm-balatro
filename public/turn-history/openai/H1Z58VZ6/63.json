{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game upgrades**\n\nI'm considering that straight upgrades might help, but going for spectral could yield immediate powerful changes like adding a seal or edition—though there's a risk. We might also ponder a reroll shop cost of 5, but then we'd have no money left. Buying a spectral pack might be better. I need to check the deck; I think it’s up to 54 from using DNA. The Blue Joker is great, giving +108 chips! For strategy, I’ll likely play a 4-card pair to activate Square and Duo.\n**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nI'm realizing that the Square Joker already has a +10 multiplier from its secondary effect, while the holographic edition adds another +10 multiplier independently. So, the Square could offer +16 chips plus a total of +20 multiplier! That’s massive. The Duo doubles it, and the Scholar gives +4 for each Ace scored, which might be useful for an Ace pair. Currently, the economy is less important than scoring, but later, I’ll need money for scaling. I may focus on getting more planets for the pair or three of a kind.\n**Examining spectral pack options**\n\nMaybe I should buy the spectral pack to try getting a strong scaling card like Cryptid to copy another card. I see the spectral cards like Familiar, Grim, Incantation, and others, which can enhance jokers, duplicate them, or even create negatives to increase slots. If I can get Ankh to copy a joker, that could be huge, but the effect needs to be used immediately. Ankh randomly copies and destroys another joker, which sounds risky, just like Hex. It's a gamble!\n**Reviewing spectral cards**\n\nI’m looking at the spectral cards. For instance, \"Talisman\" supposedly lets you add a Gold Seal to a selected card, but I need to verify that. I should recall the other cards too: \n\n- Familiar destroys 1 random card in your hand and adds 3 random enhanced face cards, which doesn’t seem great.  \n- Grim destroys 1 random card and adds 2 enhanced Aces.  \n- Incantation destroys another random card, but adds 4 enhanced numbered cards.  \n\nIt looks like some options aren’t very appealing!\n**Deciding on spectral pack purchase**\n\nI think \"Talisman\" adds a Gold Seal to a selected card, and there are other cards like Aura, Wraith, and Sigil that have interesting effects. The spectral pack could be packed with great options, but I’m a bit unsure how the timing works since some effects seem immediate. \n\nUltimately, I believe buying the spectral pack for $4 is the best move right now. Even though it leaves me with $1, it could lead to significant improvements for my deck. Plus, since I have no consumables and my joker slots are full, it seems worth the investment!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
