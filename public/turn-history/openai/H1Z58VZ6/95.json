{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nAdding playing cards increases Blue Joker's chip bonus permanently, and there's no downside except maybe managing combos, which is okay since it's free. I’ll buy a booster as my action. The game engine will present pack choices later. I might also rearrange the order of jokers; independent jokers activate left to right, so I want to place additive multipliers before multiplicative ones. Blue adds chips, so it should come first since it affects the bonus.\n**Clarifying joker order**\n\nI’m considering how the order of jokers affects the game, particularly with combinations of pairs and straights. It seems like the Square joker should come first, followed by Duo and then Order. However, Order only triggers with a straight while Duo activates with pairs. Since a hand can’t contain both at once, the order isn’t really important right now. For now, I'll focus on buying a booster and maybe consider rerolling later if needed.\n**Executing action**\n\nI need to return JSON with the action to buy a booster at position [1]. It’s a simple task, but I want to ensure everything is formatted correctly. Making sure it’s precise is important since the user relies on this action to work as expected. I’ll double-check the format and execute the action. It's straightforward, but I really want to get it right for the user! Let's proceed.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
