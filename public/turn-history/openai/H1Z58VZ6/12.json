{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI'm in the shop with just $2. I can't afford Mars, which costs $3. I think I could sell either Smiley or the Chariot to make the purchase possible. If I sell the Chariot, I’d have enough for Mars, but I'd lose a powerful item. Selling Smiley would give me $4, and I'd be able to buy Mars while keeping the Chariot. However, I realize keeping both items might be the best option. Let's proceed without selling anything.\n**Deciding on round strategy**\n\nI think it's best to select the round and then use the Chariot consumable when I have a target. However, I can't select a card from my hand right now since I’m in the shop. So, I'll need to move forward without using Chariot immediately and just proceed with the round selection. I’ll keep that strategy in mind for when the time is right.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
