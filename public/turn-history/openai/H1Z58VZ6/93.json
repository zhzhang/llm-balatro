{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI’m thinking through the full house situation and calculating the total multipliers, which might be 32 if I hold certain cards. If I drop the duo, that brings it down to 16, which isn’t ideal. I could consider selling Crazy since it's worth $2 and I’m free to hold onto the Runner. But if I keep looking at free options like the Standard pack, I might be able to enhance my deck size, which could yield benefits. However, I need to be careful about drawing combos with a larger deck.\n**Rearranging jokers for better strategy**\n\nI'm considering how to rearrange the order of jokers to optimize their trigger. In the independent category, placing additive multipliers before multiplicative ones seems beneficial. So, for Balatro, I think I should order them as: additive first (+10 from Square, +12 from Crazy) followed by the x2 and x3 multipliers. I’m planning to sell Crazy, buy Runner, and then possibly buy a standard pack afterward. However, I can only take one action at a time, so I need to choose wisely for my next step.\n**Planning next moves**\n\nFor my next turn, I'm deciding to sell Joker 3, Crazy, which sells for $2, while Runner costs $0, so it’s a good swap. I’m also reconsidering whether to keep Crazy and instead sell Blue, which fluctuates in value and currently gives +108 chips. However, I think Blue's value might not be as strong in terms of multiplier scaling compared to others. Since Square adds a decent multiplier too, my action will be to sell Joker 3 as planned.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
