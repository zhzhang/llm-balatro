{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shopping options**\n\nWe're in the shop with $11, and I have a few choices: Clever Joker for $4, boosters, or the voucher for Director's Cut at $10. I need to strategize for an ante of 5. My current build with Blue Joker chips is scaling with the deck size, which is confusing. I think I have 36 cards left, but the +108 might be confusing with the discard. Blue's showing +108; maybe it's based on a full deck count. I’ll sort through that!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI need to decide on my purchases. The Clever Joker gives +80 chips for Two Pair, but we usually favor straights or pairs with 4 cards to grow Square and keep Steel in hand. Two Pair is rare for us. Should I replace something? I have the Duo or Square to consider. The Square gives +chips and a +10 multiplier plus scales with 4 cards. Duo doubles for pairs but isn’t active with straights. I like Square's consistent bonuses!\n**Evaluating chip strategies**\n\nThe Square provides a solid benefit, giving +24 chips and a +10 multiplier, along with scaling for 4-card plays. I think I should keep Blue, Square, Order, and Crazy. The Duo is good for pairs but may not be essential since pairs are just a fallback. Removing it could weaken my pairs, but maybe it's fine if I focus on straights. However, without DNA, building straights could be tricky. So, I might keep the Duo. The Clever Joker probably isn’t fitting into my strategy, and I might pass on that. The Director's Cut voucher could be essential for boss rerolls, especially with high antes, but I also want to keep some cash for boosters.\n**Prioritizing strategies for ante**\n\nAt ante levels 5-8, bosses become challenging, so I’d focus on getting the Director's Cut first. Boosters could help too; Standard packs add cards, which increases Blue Joker chips but might dilute my draws. Blue's bonus relies on the deck size, which decreases as I play and discard. Adding random cards might hurt my synergy, but it also broadens my available options. Standard packs could contain enhanced adaptations, but I need to see the contents first. I might need that extra power since I already have good straight multipliers!\n**Planning card purchases and strategy**\n\nI’m considering how additional cards might affect drawing needed ranks. With limited funds, I could buy the Director's Cut now and keep $1, but then I miss out on boosters. Alternatively, I could purchase a Mega Standard Pack for $8, leaving $3, or a Jumbo for $6, leaving $5. The Director's Cut seems worth it for long-term benefits, even if it sacrifices some interest. I should also rearrange my joker order to optimize triggers and calculations. The best order seems to be Blue, Square, Crazy, Duo, and Order to maximize multipliers. Rearranging is a priority!\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,3,4]"}
