{"reasoning":"**Evaluating Red Card strategy**\n\nI'm considering the Red Card's value and whether I should sell it now or keep it for future use. Even though it could scale later, I've already bought boosters, and skipping is an option for now. Selling now might allow me to gain some money and open a joker slot. However, I could miss out on that future +1 sell value after the boss round. I think keeping it could restrict me later if I want more jokers, but I can sell when needed.\n**Considering selling Red Card**\n\nWith my current low money, selling the Red Card could help me buy something in the next shop if the cost is $3. But I’ll earn more after the boss battle. I’m trying to estimate potential earnings: for beating the bosses, I usually get a small reward of $3 and possibly higher for bigger ones. Not to mention rewards scale based on my progress. It might be better to hold onto the Red Card until after the boss for better selling opportunities.\n**Reassessing item value**\n\nI already have the Gift Card, which boosts sell values at the end of the round, so it makes sense to keep the Red Card for now to increase future values too. I might not sell anything soon, but if I replace the Red Card later, having that extra sell value helps. The +1 increase seems minor, but keeping a gold card from the Devil enhancement could earn me $3. I’ll need to ensure I hold onto it, despite the boss potentially removing it later.\n**Analyzing card play strategies**\n\nI can keep the gold card by not selecting it in my plays, but the question is whether I’ll even draw it. I targeted the 3♦ in my tarot selection, which might help modify that specific card. It's not guaranteed to show up during the boss round, but it's a good possibility. Since there are no more shop actions, I should go ahead with the round selection. I want to check the joker triggers and their interactions, like the Smiley and Square jokers, to ensure I'm maximizing my strategy.\n**Clarifying Joker effects**\n\nThe Square Joker's scaling brings up some interesting points. It gains +4 chips each time it's played, but this is dependent on the hand having exactly four cards. I realized the Holographic edition adds a +10 multiplier, which is separate from the chips. Since these jokers apply left-to-right independently, the order doesn’t seem crucial for the total accumulation of chips and multiplier effects. Therefore, I should move forward with the action and respond using the “round_select” JSON format with positions set to null.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
