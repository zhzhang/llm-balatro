{"reasoning":"**Understanding multiplication order**\n\nI realized that the order of multiplication really matters here. In step 3, the base multiplier is 2, then in step 4 the steel multiplies by 1.5, giving us 3. In step 5, we add 20, which brings us to 23, and then multiplying by 2 leads to a final result of 46, not 66 as I initially thought.\n\nI need to estimate using previous information: they scored 4928 with a base pair multiplier of 4. I'll work backwards to understand the calculation better.\n**Verifying calculation assumptions**\n\nI want to check if my calculations are correct here. With a pair at level 3, I start with 40 base chips and a multiplier of 4. The card chips from the kings give me 20, using only two kings for the pair, bringing the total to 60. \n\nNow, adding in Blue, I think that depends on how many cards are left in the deck. After playing, there are 29 cards left. It looks like Blue might have used 58 chips for scoring.\n\nFor Square, it might use either the old 24 or increased to 28 chips. Square gains 4 chips if a hand has 4 cards played, which might happen right before scoring, so I need to keep that in mind!\n**Clarifying chip contributions**\n\nThe description says Square gains +4 chips if a hand has exactly 4 cards, which is an 'on played' trigger that happens before scoring. This means Square's contribution increases immediately after the hand. So, Square shows 28 chips, having increased during the play. \n\nIn this scenario, I calculate total chips as base of 60, Blue's 58, and Square’s 28, totaling 146 chips. The multiplier starts at 4, and after some calculations, it looks like I’m getting different totals.\n\nI'm wondering if my understanding of how Square's bonuses fit into the multiplier is off. It seems like there's an additive aspect that I'm still clarifying.\n**Examining the score equation**\n\nI’m working on the equation for the score: score = (base chips + card chips + Blue + Square) * mult. Given the score of 4928, I suspect that the chips component is around 154. \n\nI should explore different orders of computation. One possibility could be calculating Blue, which might be 66 based on a deck of 33 cards, along with Square’s chips of either 24 or 28. \n\nAfter checking various combinations, it seems I need about a multiplier of 33.75 with my current chip total, but I'm confused because there might be factors from jokers or bosses affecting the score. It's puzzling why the score is lower than expected!\n**Reviewing scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m trying to pinpoint where my calculations have gone awry regarding scoring. The base card chip for a king should be 10, but since only two kings in play, I’m recalculating total chips. The chip total currently looks like 60, considering Square's possible contributions.\n\nI wonder if Square’s multiplier applies only under certain conditions. It might add chips but has specific requirements. I find it odd that my previous scores don't align with what I’m calculating now. It feels like some elements are missing, like possible debuffs, which I need to clarify. \n\nIt seems to be a mix of multiplier misunderstandings and how jokers factor into the score. I’ll keep working through these possibilities until I get it right.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m really digging into the scoring mechanics and the multipliers involved. It seems that Square's multiplier may not be as straightforward as I thought. I’m thinking that the holographic edition adds +10 to the multiplier, while the base Square may just provide chip scaling without any multiplier bonus. When assessing Blue's value, it looks like it uses the deck size before playing the hand, not afterward, which affects the scoring calculations. So, after careful consideration, I feel like I've got a clearer picture now!\n**Evaluating hand combinations**\n\nI’m figuring out how to maximize our scoring potential with different hand combinations. The current calculations suggest that for two pairs, the score isn't high enough, even with a Steel multiplier involved. It seems playing pairs such as Queens or Tens provides similar chip contributions. I'm considering different strategies like aiming for a straight or flush but I'm realizing that those combinations might not work with the cards in play. By preserving certain cards for flexibility, I think I can make strategic plays that will yield better scores in future hands!\n**Planning hand strategy**\n\nAfter playing 4 cards, the deck size drops from 29 to 25, and the Blue chip value will increase to +50 next hand. The Square will also increase to a value of 36. If I play another 4-card pair, I’ll be looking at a total of 146 chips. The score can be calculated, but I think my best option is to play the pair of Queens with fillers. I’ll set the card positions to ensure I have everything lined up correctly!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,4,6,7]"}
