{"reasoning":"**Weighing purchase options**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy the celestial pack for 4 or the mega standard for 8, but I'm worried about affording the telescope at 10. If I buy the celestial pack, it gives a planet right away, which could boost my scoring options. Upgrading a hand with the two pair improvement is tempting, especially early on. But I also have to think about saving for the next shop and the interest I'm gaining. I’m really leaning toward the celestial pack!\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m weighing my options for buying cards. I could buy \"Ride the Bus\" for 6, but it conflicts with the Smiley strategy since it doesn't allow face cards. I might consider the mega standard pack for 8, but that wouldn't generate any interest since I'd be left with zero. Instead, the celestial pack seems like the best path. I should act quickly, so I’ll buy the Square Joker first and then think about the celestial pack. My first action will be to buy the joker!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
