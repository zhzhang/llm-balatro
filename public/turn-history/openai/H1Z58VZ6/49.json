{"reasoning":"**Calculating game strategy**\n\nI'm considering using DNA triggers and cards to help duplicate an Ace for synergy, but in a boss blind scenario, I need points. I have to get 4000 chips in 4 hands, so that’s around 1000 on average. It could be doable since we previously scored 2040 with a high card. The ideal play might be to focus on a flush of clubs. I'm estimating that scoring will start with a base chip and then apply multipliers based on hand type.\n**Strategizing for scoring**\n\nI need to figure out how to beat 4000 chips. With two hands, it’s possible, but the Square bonus hasn’t been triggered. I’m thinking of playing a four-card hand, maybe a pair, but I want to save the bigger flush option for later. However, a four-card flush isn’t an option since it would only count as a high card. Instead, I could focus on two pairs with 8s and 3s, which could trigger the Square gain.\n**Calculating chip totals**\n\nI'm calculating the chip totals from my scoring cards: 8♠, 8♣, and 3♠ contribute to the score, but the debuffed 3♦ gives 0. In this case, my total chip count from the cards is 19, then combining with the base chips gives me 39. Adding bonuses from Blue and Square gets me to 139 chips. With a multiplier of 12, I get a total of 1668 chips, which is decent but still not enough to reach 4000. A flush seems like the better option with a score of 3072.\n**Evaluating game strategy with DNA**\n\nI'm considering using DNA in the first hand to copy an Ace, but if I only play one card, I might not score enough chips in the boss blind scenario. For the first hand, playing a high card could yield about 15 chips before bonuses from Blue and Square. That might total 1265 chips, thanks to those bonuses! The DNA triggers only if I play one card, which could let me keep a copy of K♣, though copying an Ace might be better long-term. I’m thinking through the best approach each round.\n**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI'm trying to maximize my chances by considering DNA's ability to copy Aces eventually. Currently, I don't have an Ace, but I could use DNA on something like 8♠. However, if I play one card now, I might still reach 4000 with three hands left. If I can get a good flush going, I could potentially pull off a strong score. \n\nIt's tricky balancing discarding to find an Ace and keeping a strong flush. I might play a high card while keeping the option open for future rounds. I need to make sure I don’t lose sight of my flush strategy while discarding.\n**Deciding on discard strategy**\n\nI want to keep my clubs for a flush, so I plan to discard spades and the debuffed diamond. If I discard 8♠, 3♠, and 3♦, I’ll still have five clubs, allowing me to draw three new cards with a chance to find an Ace. The probability is about 25%, so not great, but I can discard again if needed. Using DNA to copy an Ace could significantly boost my future rounds, especially since I skipped the big blind. \n\nI need to balance this with my immediate need to score 4000 chips. If I find an Ace and play it, the potential score looks strong, allowing my flush to come next. I have plenty of discards to work with, but I need to carefully manage the deck size following my strategy. Overall, I think making one discard attempt is worthwhile.\n**Evaluating net deck size**\n\nWhen I draw a card and add a copy to the deck, the net deck size may not change during the round because I'm drawing at the same time. However, after the round, it increases by one since that copy is now permanently in the deck. This means I can benefit from a larger total deck size of 45 cards, which is good for the Blue Joker’s scoring based on remaining cards. \n\nSince I need to reach 4000 points, I want to play it safe, so I’ll proceed with discarding cards 1, 2, and 8.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,8]"}
