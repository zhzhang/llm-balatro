{"reasoning":"**Considering money generation and purchases**\n\nI’m thinking about money generation based on remaining hands and interest. Having only $1 will reduce future interest, but I can build cash again. I'm considering buying the Director's Cut after Crazy, where I might spend $15 initially, then afford a voucher for $10. I'll focus on purchasing the Crazy Joker card as my primary action. I know I can only take one action at a time, so I'll stick to buying Crazy first.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
