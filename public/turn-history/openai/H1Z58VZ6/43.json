{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nDNA encourages starting with one card, and while it doesn’t need to score high just for copying, I see how it’s useful. After that, we can play 4-card hands to boost our Square chips. Blue scales with the deck size, and DNA increases that each round, which boosts Blue chips based on how many cards are left. Should we consider buying a Celestial pack? It could improve our hand levels and help our one-card strategy significantly.\n**Evaluating pack purchases**\n\nFor $4, I see there's a good chance to get Pluto, but it won't be guaranteed without a telescope. The Buffoon pack offers a choice of jokers—up to two—which could enhance scaling or multipliers. With $5, I could buy a Celestial pack and still have a dollar left, or go for the Buffoon pack while saving a dollar. However, buying a pack might require a slot for jokers. The Celestial pack seems like it has a high value, especially for boosting my high card strategy.\n**Deciding on a purchase**\n\nI'm going to buy the Celestial pack for $4 because it presents planets for selection. I’ll probably choose either Pluto or Mercury, depending on what fits best with my strategy. So, my action will be to buy the booster at position 2. This seems like the right choice to enhance my gameplay! I'm excited to see what planets I can pick and how they will impact my strategy.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
