{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip totals**\n\nI'm figuring out the total chips for our game setup, starting with base chips and additional rankings. So, 40 base chips with 20 from pairs gives me 60 right off the bat. Then I add the chips from jokers and other bonuses, which includes 110 from the blue joker, 52 from the square joker, and 50 from green chips, leading to a total of around 272. My calculations suggest a multiplier that ends up too high compared to previous hands. I think I need to adjust for potential overlaps.\n**Refining multiplier calculations**\n\nI might have gone overboard with the multiplier details. The holographic edition on the joker indeed adds +10, which means my total multiplier could be 24. Starting with 40 base chips, plus 20 from two cards brings me to 60. When I add the blue joker's 110, the square's 52, and green's 50, I get 272 overall. This gives me a plausible total of 13,056. But reflecting on previous hands, I wonder if the blue or square joker values might have been different, especially since the square’s multiplier applies only when there are exactly 4 cards in hand.\n**Understanding hand scoring**\n\nIt looks like we're indeed playing 4-card hands, which affects the scoring with the square. So if I have a pair plus two kickers, only the pair scores. The square still activates since the playing hand has exactly 4 cards. Thinking about that previous total of 5k, the multiplier might be lower, suggesting a base multiplier of 2, since the calculated total multiplier would need to be around 18.5. I also wonder about the timing of multipliers; do independent jokers affect scoring order? However, they probably don't change the total multiplier directly.\n**Evaluating blind scores and boss effects**\n\nFor the small blind set at 20k, I see that if I can score 13k per pair, I'd need around 2 hands, and with green scaling, I could potentially increase each hand's multiplier by 1. This should allow me to beat the small blind. However, for the big blind at 30k, I might need 3 hands, and for a 40k boss, it could take 3 to 4. The boss's effect of reducing the hand type level by 1 after each hand is concerning since it could weaken my pairs significantly. It seems I might need to reroll the boss to prevent losing levels permanently, especially since that decrease appears to last throughout the run.\n**Strategizing gameplay choices**\n\nIt seems skipping the small blind for the boss tag might be the best option, given it allows for a free reroll on the boss. If I play the big blind instead and earn some money, I could improve my situation, yet skipping it means losing other opportunities. However, taking the boss tag would prevent potential level drops during the boss encounter. I wonder if mitigating risks with boss rerolls or earning enough cash quickly to sustain myself might balance out my decisions. Ultimately, I want survival while also considering future shopping needs for jokers and strength.\n**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nSince I'm at -20, I'm thinking that playing the big blind and the boss might bring my total up to around -5, which could set me up for buying items afterward. It makes sense to skip the small blind to gain the boss reroll tag and still have a chance to buy something in the shop after playing big. Although I need to be mindful of remaining within -20, if I'm at -13, I can buy items up to $7. Overall, it seems best to skip the small blind for now to focus on increasing my hands and scaling the green joker. So, my action is to skip the round.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
