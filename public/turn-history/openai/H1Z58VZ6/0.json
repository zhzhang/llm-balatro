{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing the situation where I'm at ante1 with a small blind in an early game. I see the option to skip for a holographic tag, which turns the next base edition shop Joker free and adds a strong advantage. But skipping means losing some initial rewards and shop opportunities! If I skip the small blind, I'll next face the big blind without the chance to shop. I think I could press on with my starter deck, needing about 450 chips, which seems doable with three hands.\n**Evaluating skipping vs playing**\n\nI’m weighing the option to skip the small blind versus playing it. Skipping keeps my $4, but playing small gives me a $3 reward along with leftover money and earlier shopping opportunities. I realize that the holographic tag will give me a huge advantage with a free Joker, possibly a +10 multiplier. However, I'll miss out on some immediate rewards and profit from remaining hands if I choose to skip. Ending the round with extra dollars from hands is also tempting; I might net around $5-6 plus the chance to shop.\n**Deciding on the best strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about how to manage my money for buying jokers versus the value of a free holographic joker. My best move seems to be to skip the small blind for the tag—big blind still feels manageable. I wonder if I could also skip the big blind to grab a second foil tag, since owning multiple tags sounds possible. However, skipping the big blind leads me into boss territory with 600 chips, which is risky without the chance to shop first. So, I think it’s better to just skip the small blind and play the big blind to keep some funds and shop later. The next step is clear: skip the round now!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
