{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m in a standard pack and need to pick 1 out of 5 playing cards to add to my deck. The options are interesting! The 9♠ and 7♥ both create a Tarot when discarded, which could be useful. The 8♥ provides $3 upon play, while K♥ gives +10 chips. The 2♠ is a Steel card with a +2 chip value and a multiplier while in hand. I think generating a Tarot card could be powerful for consumables!\n**Analyzing card combinations**\n\nIt seems suits matter for creating a flush! I need hearts for that, and my hand levels show flush 2. However, I’m focusing on a pair/straight strategy with Duo and Order. The Runner grows with straights too. I realize a straight requires 5 cards in poker, but Balatro might allow shorter straights. Still, it looks like Square only triggers with an exact 4-card hand, which doesn’t align with a straight. So, for synergy, I’ll stick with pairs instead.\n**Choosing the right card**\n\nIt looks like I can count on a +10 multiplier regardless, which is great! The primary effect scales chips when 4-card hands are played. Since I want to generate Tarots, I should choose a purple seal card. I’m weighing the 9♠ against the 7♥. I think I’d go for the 9♠ for its higher chip base and potential for a spade flush. The Steel 2♠ offers a solid x1.5 multiplier while held, which could be advantageous, but it relies on drawing it.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m adding one card, which might slightly reduce the draw, but it’s significant when drawn. The purple seal card allows for consistent Tarot generation if I can draw and discard it, but it is more random. I can choose to discard a specific card for a Tarot. It seems better long-term to pick the purple seal, even though Steel can boost immediate scoring through antes. I need to reach ante 8 to win, and the Steel card provides a strong 1.5x multiplier when held.\n**Choosing the right card**\n\nIf I have 6 or more cards in hand, I can keep the Steel card, and since the default hand size is 8, that works out. I see Steel as a strong option, so I'd choose the 2♠ Steel. The purple seal card might produce Tarot cards, which enhance the deck and can even generate some money when sold. However, the Steel card provides direct scaling. Although a low-ranked 2 can be undesirable when played, it’s fine if held. I’ll select the 2 of Spades Steel and format my response accordingly.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
