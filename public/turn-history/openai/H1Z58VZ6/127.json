{"reasoning":"**Planning card strategy**\n\nAlright, I’m thinking that Green will increase by +1 per hand played, potentially reaching +4 after that for future plays. I need to ensure the trigger order works properly since The Duo gives a x2 multiplier. I estimate around 8964 points. For this round, let’s choose four cards: positions 3 (5 of spades), 5 (5 of hearts), 6 (5 of clubs), and 2 (6 of spades) as fillers. I’ll keep the gold card at position 8 in hand and return the JSON action play with the hand type \"three of a kind\" and an estimated value of 9000.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,5,6,2]"}
