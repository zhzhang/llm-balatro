{"reasoning":"**Assessing purchase options**\n\nI'm in a shop with $2, but can't buy anything since the magician is $3 and the standard is $4. I can't reroll, so I guess it's better to proceed to round selection. Should I sell something to buy the magician? If I sell the Scholar for $2, I'd have $4, which is enough for either the magician or standard. The magician needs me to select 2 cards in hand, so it's not immediately usable in the shop. Is the magician a strong choice?\n**Evaluating Joker and purchase options**\n\nLucky offers a 1/5 chance for a +20 multiplier and a 1/15 chance to win $20 based on the score, which is solid, but it costs $3. I'd need to sell something. I wonder which joker is the weakest. Selling the Gift Card boosts sell values, but it sacrifices future potential. The Scholar aids Aces, while the Blue Joker provides a significant chip bonus. The Gift Card might not score high now, but it's valuable for future purchases. Selling the Scholar for $2 could help me buy the magician.\n**Figuring out consumables and strategy**\n\nIt looks like I could get 1 consumable. The Scholar has a nice synergy with Aces, but I think I can manage without it. Evaluating the situation: at Ante 3, Round 4, it seems like we’re just after shopping and going into the small blind. Each ante has 3 rounds, so Round 4 probably refers to the overall progression. I think beat the boss in Ante 2, and now I'm before selecting the Ante 3 small blind. I want to keep all jokers, but we don’t have cash to buy boosters. Should I consider selling the Gift Card later?\n**Evaluating options after blinds**\n\nI can still play and earn money after the blinds. If I buy the Magician, I need to use it, but the Lucky cards might boost multipliers and cash. Sacrificing the Scholar could hurt my scoring with Aces, though it’s not a huge loss. The telescope voucher is too expensive at $10, and the Standard pack adds a playing card that isn't really important. Saving for rounds seems best; after the next blind, I might have enough cash to buy things. With $2, I have no other options, so I'll focus on round selection. As for rearrangements, the order of jokers matters for triggering effects, but for our case, the effects are additive.\n**Analyzing Square Joker effects**\n\nThe Square Joker grants chips if the played hand has exactly 4 cards and adds a +10 multiplier because of its holo edition. I wonder if reordering can help trigger on-scored jokers sooner, but it seems it won't affect the Gift Card at the end of the round. The Blue Joker offers +2 chips for each remaining card in the deck independently, which adds to my base chips. Since we have only additive multipliers and chips, the order doesn’t really matter. So, it looks like I should focus on round selection.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
