{"reasoning":"**Calculating multipliers in cards**\n\nI’m working through some card game mechanics here. Square gives a +10 multiplier independently, while Blue adds chips. If the base multiplier goes from 1 to 2, that’s a significant change. For a high card, the final multiplier would be the base multiplier plus the square and scholar adjustments. I need to keep track of how these multipliers add up, especially when considering pairs and their implications on the overall score.\n**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nI'm calculating the multipliers and chips for a card game. The square gives a consistent +10 multiplier, while the scholar adds +4 for each ace scored, which can stack up. For two aces, that's +8. So, if the base multiplier starts at 3, I get a total of 21, increasing to 22 after Mercury. Regarding chips, the base goes from 25 to 40, plus additional chips from the aces and other bonuses. All this leads to substantial gains in overall chips!\n**Optimizing card play strategy**\n\nI'm figuring out how to maximize chip gains in the game. Mercury gives +533 chips for a pair, but since achieving a pair requires two aces, using DNA should speed up acquiring those. I could also leverage high cards to trigger DNA sooner, even if I don't win the hand. It looks like focusing on 4-card hands is beneficial because of Square's scaling features, which provide bonuses. Ultimately, I want my strategy to revolve around these 4-card combinations.\n**Weighing card hand strategies**\n\nWhen I play 4 cards, if the best hand is just a high card, only that highest card counts for chips and triggers, meaning the other three won’t activate bonuses like Smiley or Scholar. It may be more advantageous to form a pair with those 4 cards since then only two cards score. This way, I can still benefit from Square scaling and scoring a pair, which might be more valuable in the long run compared to just a high card.\n**Considering planet card levels**\n\nIt seems that planet cards have their own levels, with descriptions indicating their strengths. For example, Mercury is at level 2 and offers better boosts, making it a stronger choice compared to Pluto at level 1. I need to think strategically about my deck since I can copy aces using DNA. Playing one ace at the start of each round could lead to pairs that help me win. Mercury looks promising for future scaling, especially with its added benefits. Selecting Mercury should set me up for better scoring potential.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
