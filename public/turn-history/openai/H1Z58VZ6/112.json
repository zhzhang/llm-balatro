{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI’m weighing the best planet pack choices, looking at Earth, Mars, and Saturn. Since we usually play pairs, I’m leaning towards Earth with the Full House because it has a level 2 base with 65 chips and a multiplier of 6. I believe Earth adds +25 chips and +2 to the multiplier, which is good for full houses. Although straights don’t typically involve pairs, could we shift to straights? I’m also considering how other hands like Four of a Kind contain pairs, which may affect my decision.\n**Evaluating hand combinations**\n\nI'm thinking about how Wily triggers with three-of-a-kind, and I wonder if a full house counts for that. Since a full house indeed contains three of a kind, Wily would trigger for both full house and Four of a Kind. Earth allows for that, but I’ve built around 4-card hands. A full house needs 5 cards, which means I wouldn’t reach the Square growth that requires an exact 4 cards. It might be time to shift to sometimes playing 5-card hands for a bigger base.\n**Reviewing planet upgrades**\n\nI'm considering the benefits of using Earth, which upgrades a full house from level 2 to level 3. It states \"+2 Mult and +25 chips,\" suggesting it increases the level by 1. The current level appears on the planet card itself, and any base amounts increase accordingly. So, a full house would become 90 chips with an 8 multiplier. In comparison, Saturn upgrades a straight from level 1 by +30 chips and +3 multiplier, but straights still require 5 cards, not 4 unless jokers are involved.\n**Choosing planet upgrades**\n\nI'm looking at Mars, which upgrades Four of a Kind from level 1 to 90 chips and a multiplier of 10. Four of a Kind is tricky to achieve with a standard deck unless I have pairs. Earth seems like the better option since it allows me to aim for full houses, which will trigger Wily and Duo bonuses. While straights don’t activate Wily, they might still be consistent. I’ve played full houses a couple of times already, so I’ll go with Earth for that immediate upgrade and select pack card position 1.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
