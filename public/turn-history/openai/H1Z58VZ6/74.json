{"reasoning":"**Calculating full house score**\n\nI have three 10s and two queens, which gives me a full house (10s over queens) when I play 10♥, 10♣, 10♦, Q♠, and Q♦. My base chips are 65 with a base multiplier of 6. Each 10 and queen contributes chips based on their rank, so I calculate this as 50 from the full house and additional chips from the Blue Joker and Square. Finally, after considering the multiplier, my total ends up being 7264 chips!\n**Calculating total score options**\n\nI need a total of 10,000 chips across five hands. It’s challenging because a straight with Order could give me 7,056 chips at level 1, while the full house is around 7,264. I’m considering if we could win with one hand by combining a straight and a pair, but that doesn’t seem possible. If I hit a flush at level 2, I might get around 3,200 chips, which still falls short of 10,000. So, I need to strategize more!\n**Exploring scoring possibilities**\n\nI’m trying to find the best scoring strategy, weighing options like a straight with a multiplier of three or a pair with a multiplier of two. A full house could also work with a multiplier of six. The straight has a base multiplier of four, but the chip values can be tricky. The rank values are straightforward: 10, J, Q, K, and A all have specific chip values. I want to maximize my chips, focusing on high-value cards with face cards adding significant worth!\n**Calculating full house and four of a kind**\n\nI have a full house right away with three 10s and two queens by playing Q♠, 10♥, 10♣, Q♦, and 10♦. It should be strong enough to win in two hands, but I’ll play it in the first round. An alternative would be aiming for four of a kind, but I only have those three 10s. If I play an unknown 10, I could potentially make four of a kind, boosting my total chips and multiplier to around 7,548!\n**Planning hand strategy**\n\nIf the unknown card is a queen, I can't form four of a kind with just the three 10s. If it’s a 10, then I could have four 10s but would only end up with one queen. Regardless, I’m considering using the DNA option to copy a high chip card but it might not be worth it since I’d be sacrificing a hand for potentially low chips. Instead, I'll play a strong full house now, establishing a solid base with three 10s and two queens. I estimate scoring around 7,300 chips, which gets me closer to my 10,000 target!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6,7]"}
