{"reasoning":"**Considering purchase strategy**\n\nI’m in a shop with just $1, and the options are all too expensive — Lusty Joker at $5, Buffoon pack for $4, and Telescope for $10. Selling something could free up enough cash for either the Lusty or Buffoon pack, so should I do that? My build is strong with Smiley, Square, and Blue cards. Not sure if I should sell Smiley, but I wonder if keeping it makes sense for focusing on face cards. Square seems to have a significant multiplier effect with holographic benefits, which could be really useful.\n**Analyzing card effects**\n\nIt seems like the Square Joker gives a secondary +10 multiplier thanks to its holographic edition, which is really exciting! I’m figuring that its base effect is gaining 4 chips if 4 cards are played, so with 12 chips now, that secondary multiplier is definitely an advantage. Blue provides a hefty +104 chips per hand that will grow with the deck size, and Scholar is excellent for aces. Maybe I don’t need Smiley as much; I can move on to selecting the next round — should it be a big blind or a boss challenge?\n**Deciding on card sales**\n\nNext up is the Big Blind of Ante 3, and I think I might need a chip threshold around 600, but it could be 450? My build feels strong, so I should keep some money for interest. Right now, I have $1. I could sell Smiley for $4, which would give me enough to buy Lusty, possibly improving my multiplier for hearts. Alternatively, I could sell Scholar for $3 to buy the Buffoon pack. The downside is that Scholar synergizes with Aces and DNA, so selling it feels risky. Smiley might be more expendable, despite my focus on Aces and pairs.\n**Planning card upgrades**\n\nThe Square provides a nice multiplier, and I’m considering getting more multiplier jokers later. The Buffoon pack might offer some common multipliers too, but I'm uncertain. Since I already have full joker slots, getting a new one means I’d need to sell something. Selling Smiley could help me afford the Buffoon pack, which could yield a better card. However, if the pack doesn't offer an upgrade, I might have wasted my resources. Leaving my $1 untouched keeps things simpler, but I’ll likely have more opportunities to earn chips in the next round. We should definitely aim for improvements!\n**Focusing on economy**\n\nI'm thinking I might need to prioritize my economy, especially since I only have $1 right now. Keeping Smiley could be a option for later, but selling him would give me $5, which would earn some interest—though interest is calculated at the end of the round based on my total. Selling Smiley now could fund a future interest snowball. We can sell him and then head to round select, so selling Smiley seems like the best immediate action. I should go ahead and sell him!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
