{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card enhancements**\n\nI'm looking at card strengths: the 2 Strength power increases the rank of up to 2 cards, which could create higher ranks like Aces, but isn't as strong as bonus or glass powers. The 3 Justice enhancement turns one card into Glass, providing a strong multiplier but with a risk of destruction. If I have one Glass card, it could double my overall multiplier during scoring. Meanwhile, the 4 Devil power makes one card Gold, earning $3 if held, but it may be less useful while in the shop.\n**Choosing card strategies**\n\nIn the future, I plan to keep certain cards in hand. The 5 Star power can convert up to 3 cards to Diamonds, which might help with a flush, but our current build isn’t really focused on that. Given our strong scoring options, I think I should enhance a key card to Glass instead. I want to choose a rank that appears often in scoring hands, like mid ranks for straights, because that can double my multiplier significantly. Even if it gets destroyed, losing one card is manageable.\n**Examining card strategies**\n\nI'm considering the Square hand type, which prefers 4-card hands, but it's tricky since a straight requires 5 cards. I can't form a straight with only 4 cards, so Square's scaling isn't triggered. While it can yield some chips and provide a bonus to certain plays, it seems less valuable for my current strategy focused on pairs and full houses. We do have two strong straight jokers, so using straights when possible could be beneficial. I wonder which tarot gives the best average for my builds.\n**Considering card enhancements**\n\nThe Hierophant card gives me +30 chips each time it scores, which is great since Bonus Aces or Queens can really boost my chips with their multipliers. Two bonus cards might even rival Glass without the risk. On the other hand, Justice provides a x2 multiplier when the card scores, and since my multipliers often range around 4-6 plus additional bonuses, that could lead to enormous totals, like with a full house. I might go with Justice on a card I use frequently, perhaps an Ace, since they’re often part of pairs.\n**Deciding on card enhancements**\n\nI’m considering applying Justice to a card, but maybe not the Ace since it may not be used frequently. A Queen could be a better choice since we have duplicates. Looks like there are at least two Queens left in the deck, which is promising because they can score high and form pairs. I’ll likely choose the Queen of Hearts, as it can double the multiplier when paired. However, it could be destroyed, which might affect my Blue joker chips, but the impact seems small. So, I’ll select Justice for scoring, targeting the Queen in hand position 4.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,4]"}
