{"reasoning":"**Evaluating blind selection strategy**\n\nSkipping the small blind means giving up the $3 reward and the chance to shop after winning. But if I skip that, I’ll still go to the big blind selection. If I win big, I can shop afterward. So, skipping doesn’t completely eliminate shopping opportunities. It seems like skipping the small blind just costs me one shop. On the other hand, skipping the big blind could lead to a Rare Tag, which comes with a free rare joker in the shop! But I’d need space to buy that.\n**Deciding on blind strategy**\n\nIf I skip the big blind, I'll have to face the boss without the benefits from shopping and with boss diamonds in a tough spot. My build is decent, featuring a Blue Joker with +104 chips, and a Square Joker that adds multipliers for specific cards. However, I need to prioritize earning money by playing small since we’re a bit low on funds. Additionally, the top-up tag needs room, and I'd prefer to keep my solid setup instead of adding random common jokers. So, I think playing the small blind is the better strategy!\n**Analyzing joker triggers**\n\nI’m looking into how our jokers trigger benefits. The Smiley Face and Scholar jokers activate on scored hands, while the Square Joker offers +4 chips if I play it with exactly four cards. It seems that the Square Joker's gains count before scoring, but I don’t think the order of play affects anything. The Blue Joker operates independently, and the Gift Card comes into play at the end of the round. So, I think I can go ahead and just play the round, and estimating chips might not be necessary after all.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
