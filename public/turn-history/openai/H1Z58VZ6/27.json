{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Square Joker mechanics**\n\nIt looks like the Standard Square Joker gives +4 chips when played with exactly 4 cards. That's great because these chips are permanent. The Holo edition actually provides an additional +10 multiplier, making for a total of at least +10 multiplier. Plus, there's an extra +5 multiplier from the Smiley for each face scored. We should consider focused plays with 4-card hands to maximize Square Joker's potential while ensuring we still score over 1200.\n**Evaluating scoring options**\n\nI see that only 10s score, and since face cards don’t count, Smiley won’t trigger. It’s better to play hands where face cards contribute to the highest score, like a pair of face cards, but that isn’t currently an option. If I go with a high card, only the Queen scores, while the Jack doesn’t. Maybe I could use a pair of 10s with two junk cards to maximize Square Joker’s scaling. That gives me a pair score of 10 chips plus 20 chips for the 10s, totaling 30 chips.\n**Calculating multipliers and chips**\n\nI’m working with a base multiplier of 2. The Square (Holo) Joker adds +10, while the Smiley doesn’t score if no face cards are played. The Red Card contributes 0, but the Blue Joker adds 88 chips. It seems these independent jokers activate when held, increasing the chip count. So, I calculate my chips: 30 (base) + 88 (Blue Joker) = 118, and my multiplier becomes 2 + 10 = 12, giving a total of 1416.   \n\nPlaying exactly 4 cards will also scale the Square Joker, gaining +4 chips permanently for future hands. The Blue Joker adds +2 chips for each remaining card, currently giving me +88 chips. So, I definitely need to play 4 cards to maximize my strategy while ensuring I still score over 1200!\n**Understanding card dynamics**\n\nIf I play 4 cards, the deck count decreases by 4 since those cards get discarded and new cards are drawn. I start with 44 cards, so after playing 4, I’ll have 40 left in the deck. The Blue Joker will add +80 for future hands, but for this current hand, it starts at +88. It seems that the Blue Joker's effects are likely triggered during scoring, using the current deck count. So for this hand, I’ll factor in the +88 chips at scoring time.\n**Strategizing for optimal hand**\n\nTo play exactly 4 cards, I’ll use 10♠ and 10♥ for a pair of 10s, along with two low spades, like 8♠ and 6♠. This yields a highest score of a pair, but using a King or Queen for high card could trigger the Smiley bonus. If I play Q♥ with three low cards, I’d get +10 chips and score a total of 1648, which is better than a pair's 1416.  \n\nHowever, I need to consider the Blue Joker's effect, which resets after each round and will be +104 at the start of the boss. Winning quickly is essential to preserve remaining hands for money, so I’ll aim for a high-card win, which counts towards times played!\n**Deciding on hand strategy**\n\nCurrently, Two Pair has the highest play count, while high card is at 1. If I play a high card, it could tie with Two Pair, potentially affecting future rewards if I buy a telescope. I'm leaning towards keeping Two Pair as the most played since it might yield a planet later.  \n\nHowever, using a high card with a Queen could trigger the Smiley bonus, adding to my multiplier. I’ll select four cards: Q♥ with three low distinct cards (like 2♠, 6♠, and 4♣) to maintain my scoring without creating unwanted pairs or straights. This setup gives me 1648 estimated chips. I believe this balance could effectively maximize my advantage!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [5,4,3,8]"}
