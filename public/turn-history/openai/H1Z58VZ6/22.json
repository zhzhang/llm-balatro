{"reasoning":"**Analyzing booster options**\n\nI'm considering some boosters: the Mega Standard for $8 adds two cards, while the Celestial pack costs $4 and lets us pick a planet. There's also a Telescope voucher for $10, but that's too pricey. Buying Celestial could help level up my Two Pair hand type, but it gives random planets. If I go for Mega Standard, I’d spend my money entirely and have no cash left for interest. I’m weighing my options carefully here!\n**Deciding on card options**\n\nI’m thinking about whether to buy Smiley now and sell it later, but it seems like a good choice. The bus might be beneficial in the long run if I avoid scoring face cards, which could be tricky with a random deck. It seems smarter to skip the bus. I’m leaning toward buying the Celestial pack; it could upgrade my frequently used Two Pair or help with flushes and straights. Two Pair and certain hands like four of a kind are achievable with four cards, but I need to consider what’s best.\n**Clarifying card play rules**\n\nI'm pondering the rules around playing four cards in Balatro—wondering if I can still form a flush or straight. However, I think a flush requires five cards and a straight does too. I can achieve a three of a kind with three out of four, which is good. Since the Square Joker encourages four-card hands, leveling up my Two Pair and Four of a Kind seems smart. With $8, buying the Celestial pack for $4 keeps some cash on hand for later, which might be the best choice!\n**Deciding between boosters**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy the Celestial pack or maybe reroll, but rerolling costs $5 and I can't do that right now. Buying both the bus and Celestial isn't possible either since that's $10. I think the Celestial pack is ultimately the better choice because it increases my base chips and multipliers, which synergizes nicely. The Mega Standard boosts card count but could clutter my deck without providing real benefits. So, my plan is to buy the Celestial pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
