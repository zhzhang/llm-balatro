{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shopping options**\n\nI have $6 and the only card available is Showman for $5, which isn't great since it has no scoring and allows duplicates. I’m thinking it might be smarter to reroll the shop for a better joker or consumable, but rerolling would leave me with nothing. Alternatively, I could skip shopping and go straight to round selection. I’m also considering selling the credit card, but keeping it could help with debt since it can be used for negative purchases. However, rerolling costs money, and the interest doesn’t apply if I’m in the negative.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI have $6, which would let me buy Showman and keep $1, but that means I can't reroll unless I go into debt. Showman could allow multiple cards, but it doesn't fit my scoring strategy focused on pairs and a full house. My fifth slot is wasted on the Credit Card, so I need a better joker or an economic card. Selling the Credit Card could give me $1, allowing me to reroll and still buy something, but I might want to keep it for flexibility with expensive items.\n**Choosing to reroll**\n\nI’m considering that there aren't any expensive items available right now, and with a boss fight coming up, my funds are low at $6. Even though selling the credit card might limit me later, it could help me afford a strong joker. However, I think keeping it until a better option comes along might be wise. I could reroll now, leaving me with no money but still able to make purchases using the credit card for debt. I think rerolling is the best next step!\n**Assessing reroll options**\n\nI need to remember that the reroll costs $6, which would leave me with nothing, but I can go into debt if necessary. Still, I wonder if I should keep some money since interest matters. At ante 5, my focus should be on survival and scaling, and the Showman card isn’t helping with that. Perhaps I could consider round selection instead to save money. It seems I'm in a good spot after just beating the big blind of ante 5, now preparing for the boss.\n**Preparing for the boss**\n\nI need to prepare for the boss battle. Right now, I have $6, but I should save up to reroll the boss later for $10, in case it gets tough. Selling a joker could help me reach $10, but I’m worried about losing important jokers. I also think about rerolling in the shop, which costs $6, but might help me find consumables or strong cards. I need to consider scoring needs, which might require multiple hands for success and scaling, so finding stronger cards is crucial.\n**Deciding on the next action**\n\nI have the option to use the Director's Cut, but I don't have enough money. I’m leaning towards rerolling in the shop to find new options, since this is the last shop before the boss. The reroll is expensive, but I can use the credit card to go negative. Buying Showman could create duplicates, which might help me find more strong cards later, but it doesn’t score now. Given that I don’t have consumables, I think rerolling makes the most sense, so I’ll proceed with that.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
