{"reasoning":"**Clarifying Square Joker effect**\n\nSo, the Square Joker effect gives +12 chips, but there's another detail: it gains +4 chips if the played hand has exactly 4 cards. I'm trying to sort this out. The total chips seem to amount to 12, which is always applied. The Blue Joker adds +2 chips for each remaining card, totaling +82 chips. Aces give +20 chips and a multiplier boost while DNA triggers pre-scoring. In total, I’m calculating the base chips and multipliers from the hand type levels. The base comes to 186 chips.\n**Calculating chip multipliers**\n\nI'm figuring out multipliers: base is 6 and holo adds 10, totaling a multiplier of 16. So, my estimated hand chips come to 186 times 16, which is 2976. That’s pretty good, but I need 4000. One option might be to play a high card first. I was thinking about DNA, which could copy an Ace, but I don’t have one in hand. I could discard to potentially find one, but since I already have a flush, it might be smarter to play that first, even though DNA won't trigger if I do.\n**Considering survival and scoring strategies**\n\nSurvival is the priority. I think it's still possible to trigger DNA in the next round. Now, when considering the square scaling, if I play a 4-card hand, I gain +4 chips, but a flush needs 5 cards. Maybe I could play a 4-card high card hand instead, like a K♣ Q♣ 9♣ 8♣, or even aim for a pair or two-pair with hearts. If I put down the Q♥ and Q♣ plus two others, I could score a pair and trigger the Square. That would give me base chips from the pair and a multiplier of 4.\n**Calculating total chips and strategy**\n\nSo, I'm adding up base chips: 40 plus 20 gives me 60. If I add in the Blue chips (82) and the Square (12), that brings my total to 154. Then, with a multiplier of 14 from base and holo (4 plus 10), my overall total ends up being 2156. That's pretty solid! Plus, it would trigger the Square to gain an additional 4 chips, making it 16. \n\nIt’s tricky since I’d be using 4 cards and drawing 4 new ones, potentially breaking my flush. I have to consider what to keep in hand—K♣, 9♣, 8♣, and any left clubs. I might go for the flush now for almost 3000, then aim for high-scoring cards later, like a pair of queens.\n**Planning chip strategies and card plays**\n\nI'm figuring out the situation with four hands available, which gives me options. I could use the current flush to get closer to my goal of 1024. For the next hand, a high card could work, potentially with a multiplier of 16, which means I need a K♣ or Q♥ to boost my chips. With calculated base chips and the effects of the Blue and Square cards, I could reach 1199 chips. \n\nI want to play the flush first for 2976, then follow up with a high card. However, I have to think about my DNA options regarding the K♣. If I play it first, I might end up successfully drawing a copy. That would mean I'd still have enough clubs for a flush, especially if I can keep the Q♣, 9♣, and 8♣. I'm looking to keep my options open while ensuring I have the right cards for scoring.\n**Analyzing card strategy and DNA usage**\n\nI’m considering copying the K♣, but maybe it would be better to copy an Ace for synergy with Scholar. However, I only have three discards left and four hands. I might risk running out of discards. Still, I have a path to victory by DNA copying K♣ now, which permanently increases the deck size. That could actually benefit the Blue Joker since more cards mean more chips over time. So, my plan is to play the K♣ as my high card to trigger DNA, aiming for around 1200 chips before proceeding with the flush. I’ll format this action in JSON.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4]"}
