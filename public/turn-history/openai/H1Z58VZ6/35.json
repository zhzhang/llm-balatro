{"reasoning":"**Considering jokers and scores**\n\nI’m thinking about capacity and having four jokers, which allows me to add one. After purchasing Scholar, I might need to rearrange the jokers based on trigger order. With scored jokers, Smiley triggers with face cards, and Scholar triggers with aces, and I wonder if the order affects retriggers since both are additive. Independent jokers like Square and Blue have their specifics, with Square adding +10 multiplier. I'm trying to keep everything clear with these different multipliers and triggers!\n**Clarifying holo edition effects**\n\nI'm considering that the holo edition adds a +10 multiplier independently. But, wait, does it mention the edition as holo? Typically, that does give a +10 multiplier. The secondary description says +10 multiplier too; maybe that’s specifically from the holo edition and not the base. It’s a bit confusing, but I think it should be fine. Anyway, I’m ready to purchase Scholar now and will return the information in JSON format!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
