{"reasoning":"**Evaluating pack strategy**\n\nIn this pack state, I can sell a joker using the available command before making a selection, which is interesting. But if the choices are immediate, I need to create space first before selecting Wraith. I'm considering selling the Scholar joker since it might be the weakest, but it’s rare too. I wonder if selling Scholar to make room for Wraith is the best option. Plus, I’ve already paid $4—it feels like a waste to skip the booster.\n**Deciding on card actions**\n\nI realize I need a first-hand card with just one card to copy any played card, which is a great advantage for boosting my deck and the blue joker's value. So, I'll definitely keep DNA. It seems selling Scholar makes sense, but spectral selection happens immediately. If I choose Wraith without a free slot, it might not work. I think the safest move is to sell the Scholar joker first, then select Wraith. Since I can only take one action at a time, selling the joker is the immediate step.\n**Choosing the best action**\n\nI see that selecting Wraith creates a random Rare Joker, which would add to my inventory. This means I'll definitely need a slot available. Selling the Scholar joker seems like the best option. Alternatively, I could take Hex and keep only the Square Joker, but there's too much risk with the random Joker. So, my clear action is to sell the Scholar joker in position 2. Let’s go ahead and do that!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
