{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game actions**\n\nI’m at boss blind right now, and I can't skip this phase, so I need to play. The only action available is to play_round. I wonder if selling items might help, but it doesn't seem necessary right now. Could I use Chariot? Not really, since I can't select a hand when I'm blind. The use_consumable action requires having a target, and I don’t have that. So, I guess it's time to just play_round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
