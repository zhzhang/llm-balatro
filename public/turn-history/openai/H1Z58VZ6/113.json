{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m considering our shopping situation at ante6 round 11, where I have $1 but need to buy cards like Strength ($3), Walkie Talkie ($4), Buffoon pack ($4), and Telescope ($10). Since we have a credit card, I can go negative up to -$20 for purchases. My strategy involves 4-card hands and optimizing our jokers. I’m debating if the Walkie Talkie, costing $4, is worth selling a joker. Maybe buying the Telescope voucher with the debt could be a good move?\n**Analyzing card purchase options**\n\nI’m weighing the decision to buy a Telescope for $10, which would drop my balance to -$9—still within limits. The idea of pairs being heavily played is appealing since celestial packs include Mercury, enhancing my main hand. However, we only have $1 right now, and I’m concerned about the interest from going negative. Buying a Buffoon pack might be more immediate for finding a joker replacement. Selling something could help with that, but I need to be careful about losing my credit card option.\n**Exploring card purchase strategies**\n\nI’m considering a couple of strategies here. I could keep the Credit Card for buying options, like the Buffoon pack, which doesn’t require a slot. However, it would yield jokers, so I’d need to sell something to make room. Then there's the option to buy the Strength tarot for $3, but I don't have a slot available. I need to prioritize getting a joker multiplier or scoring synergy, and using debt to get the Buffoon pack for $4 could work if I manage space effectively. I think there's a chance to preview and skip selections, but I need to confirm the rules here.\n**Evaluating card choices and strategies**\n\nI’m looking at the option to choose one of up to two Joker cards, and I wonder if I can select none. It might be better not to risk it. The Walkie Talkie offers a +10 chip bonus and a +4 multiplier each time I score with a 10 or 4. If I play a pair of 10s, that could yield a significant boost! But we often play arbitrary pairs, not strictly 10s or 4s. The deck has three tens and one four left. Although I can use Strength to upgrade to 10s, I still need those ranks, and the scaling from 4-card hands with Square is essential, offering more chips and multipliers.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m analyzing the benefits of the holographic edition for jokers, which gives a +10 multiplier on top of Square Joker's +10. The Square might give a total of 52 chips plus 20 multiplier. The Blue Joker offers a whopping +110 chips, while the Duo x2 multiplier could add to that. I really need to consider getting the Telescope since it will help with my main hand pairs. I can buy it and go to -$9, which is manageable, especially since I have the Credit Card option. Therefore, buying the Telescope seems like the best move!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
