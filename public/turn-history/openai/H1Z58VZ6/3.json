{"reasoning":"**Calculating probabilities in card game**\n\nI've got 9 hearts in a total of 40 cards. If I discard 4 non-heart cards and draw 4, I want to find the probability of getting at least one heart. I’m estimating that probability using combinations, and I think I calculated it to be around 65.5%. I consider discarding specific cards—Js, 2s, 6c, and 4d—to keep my hearts. I feel like aiming for a flush is crucial to get enough chips, so I’ll stick to that discard strategy!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
