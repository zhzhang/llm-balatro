{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m in a situation where I have $0, so I can only either round select or sell jokers to buy either Saturn or a To Do List. I realize I have strong jokers like DNA, Blue, Square holo, Duo, and Order. My current plan is likely to play pairs with Square and Duo, while Order encourages straights. I need $3 to buy Saturn, which would enhance my strategy, but selling one joker seems necessary to get the funds. DNA could be less critical now, but it's also powerful for deck growth.\n**Analyzing hand strategy**\n\nI see that Square is effective with +16 chips and a +20 multiplier, especially since it scales with 4-card hands. Duo offers a good benefit for pairs, while Order boosts straights significantly. The challenge is that I can only play one hand type at a time. Straights require 5 cards, which conflicts with using Square. I wonder if focusing on straights with Order could be the way to go, but I need to consider scaling for upcoming challenges. More strategizing is needed!\n**Evaluating strategy options**\n\nI’m wondering if my deck is fully optimized. A pair strategy might still be better. Using 4 cards to form a pair can trigger Square and Duo, plus add Blue for a potential yield of around 150 chips and a 24 multiplier. That could result in about 7200 chips. \n\nIf I focus on a straight with Order instead, it seems to yield lower chips in comparison. Selling Square could hurt my multiplier even further, making pairs the likely safe bet for now. I need to think more about incorporating the best strategies!\n**Considering hand options**\n\nI'm thinking about whether my hand includes a straight, but if I focus on pair hands, I won't be using Order. Keeping Square and Duo might be wiser for now. Selling Order for $4 to buy Saturn seems silly, and while selling DNA could also give me $4, it'd mean losing a powerful asset. \n\nMaybe I should just hold on to everything and not make any sales right now. After the round, I’ll regain money from leftover hands, especially since I have Grabber for an extra hand. Things are looking better!\n**Optimizing joker arrangement**\n\nI’ve realized I don’t need to sell anything. I can rearrange the jokers to trigger their effects more effectively. My jokers are DNA, Blue, Square, Duo, and Order. They activate from left to right, and it seems important to place the Square before Duo and Order to maximize my multipliers. \n\nThe current order is already optimal: DNA, Blue, Square, Duo, then Order. Since I can’t buy anything right now, the next step is to move on to round selection. I'm ready!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
