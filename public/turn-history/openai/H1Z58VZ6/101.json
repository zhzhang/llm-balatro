{"reasoning":"**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI’ve got $6 after buying Wily, and I can reroll for a better joker to replace my credit card. But I can only take one action. Should I go for buying card 2? I need to consider what I have available in the shop cards list, which includes Showman and Wily. It looks like I’ll go ahead and buy card 2.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
