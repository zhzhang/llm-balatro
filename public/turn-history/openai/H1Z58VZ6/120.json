{"reasoning":"**Rearranging indices**\n\nI’m looking at the sequence where Duo comes before Green. With the additive multiplicative function for Green coming after multiplication, it doesn't seem right. I'll rearrange the order now since it's crucial. The new order should be Blue(1), Square(2), Green(5), Duo(3), Credit(4). So, I'll provide the list of indices in the current order as [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]. Time to make that adjustment!\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,3,4]"}
