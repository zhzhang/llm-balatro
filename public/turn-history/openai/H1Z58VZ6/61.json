{"reasoning":"**Thinking through game mechanics**\n\nI’m at the ante for round 7, and it looks like we're about to move to the Big Blind. After the Small Blind, I should head to the shop to select the Big Blind. We need to prepare for increasing chip requirements, which ties into our long-term scaling strategies. I see that the Square Joker scales chips by +4 with each 4-card hand, and the DNA can allow for some card duplications. Overall, the changing deck size affects chip values, but it's a bit confusing how that resets after winning rounds.\n**Analyzing deck and shop strategy**\n\nI see that the current value is +108, which might mean the deck size is around 54 cards, possibly with DNA copies. The Blue Joker offers a solid chip bonus that's independent and beneficial for all hands. There’s also a multiplier with Duo for pairs and Square for a total boost. While Scholar is helpful for Aces, our main hands probably won't feature them. At the shop, I see options like the Saturn planet for upgrades or the To Do List joker, which requires careful consideration before replacing anything, like Scholar.\n**Evaluating card strategy and options**\n\nThe Scholar helps with Ace hands, but dropping it might limit my options. I could sell Scholar for $3 and then purchase the To Do List for $4, leaving me with around $4 in net cost. However, I'm unsure if I need To Do List since it changes the hand type at the end of each round. While playing a Flush could earn $4, my best hand is still likely a pair with Duo. I wonder if it's better to focus on consistency.\n**Weighing options for gameplay**\n\nSometimes, bosses can restrict our strategies. With my deck being nearly standard, achieving a Flush isn't guaranteed, but I can try using discards and Grabber to manage five hands. The To Do List uses a joker slot, so I might need to drop something, perhaps Scholar, since I don't often play Aces. Still, Scholar offers a nice multiplier and chip bonus for Aces. I'm considering other options, like Saturn for chips and multipliers, but it might be situational depending on bosses and their debuffs. Upgrading high cards seems like a solid plan.\n**Strategizing consumable use**\n\nI’m primarily aiming for a pair, but if a boss debuffs pairs, I might need a high card as a fallback. Using Pluto could improve my high card, while Venus might help me get three of a kind more often, especially with DNA duplications. Since I'm in the shop, I can use consumables now. I need to make sure to use Pluto and Venus to increase hand levels permanently before leaving. I'll start with Pluto to level up my high card first, as that will enhance my chip value significantly. After that, I’ll use Venus.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
