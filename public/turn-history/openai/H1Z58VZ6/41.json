{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI’m considering my options for spending $8 in the shop. I could buy the DNA for that amount, but there are also jokers and packs available at lower prices, like Lusty Joker for $5 and Buffoon and Celestial packs at $4. \n\nBuying the DNA seems powerful if I can play one card consistently in the first hand. Our strategy relies on a strong single-card high card ace approach, especially since we’ve seen how well that can work!\n**Computing score potential**\n\nI've already won the small blind with a four-card hand for square scaling, but I can start the next blind using just one card, an ace, to copy. However, I need an ace in hand to use the DNA for copying. To ensure I can have only one card in the first hand, I must score enough, as future blinds will increase in difficulty. I’m calculating whether I can reach the targets with a one-card ace by adding up my base chips and additional values from my cards and jokers.\n**Analyzing chip potential**\n\nThe Square Joker only adds chips if I have exactly four cards, giving a multiplier of +10 and an independent 12 chips. The Smiley Face only works with face cards, but not aces. \n\nSo, calculating total chips: base 5 + ace 11 + scholar 20 + blue 104 + square 12 gives 152 chips. My multipliers lead to 15, which makes the total 2280 — not enough to reach 3000. \n\nIf I play face high cards, like KQJ, I could gain additional multipliers, but I'm still falling short for the big and boss blinds with a one-card high card strategy.\n**Evaluating DNA strategy**\n\nThe DNA card only requires that the first hand has one card, so I don't necessarily have to win the blind right away. I can play a one-card hand to duplicate and earn some chips, and then take my time with the remaining hands, which is fine since we might have four more chances.\n\nThe DNA is great for building my deck by copying key cards each round, especially Aces for synergy, but I need to make space in my hand. I’m trying to decide which joker to sell, starting with the Blue Joker, which provides +104 chips and scales with the deck size.\n**Deciding on purchases and strategy**\n\nThe DNA card is appealing because it increases deck size by adding permanent cards, which benefits my Blue Joker chips. The Blue Joker adds +2 chips for each remaining card, making it even stronger with a larger deck! \n\nThe Square Joker offers a +10 multiplier but only works with exactly four cards, while the Smiley Face provides multipliers from face cards. The Scholar card is fantastic for scoring with Aces. \n\nTo buy DNA, I need to sell the Gift Card for $5 to open a slot, allowing me to afford DNA at $8, leaving me with $5 remaining. Selling the Gift Card seems like the best move!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
