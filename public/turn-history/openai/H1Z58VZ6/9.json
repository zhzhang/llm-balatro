{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchase strategy**\n\nI believe the tag triggers when buying a base edition Joker from any source, but for safety, purchasing the Buffoon pack and selecting a base edition Joker should work well. The cost is $9 and $4 for the pack, making it a priority to get the Joker early. Also, considering buying the Chariot card for Steel at $3, which gives a good multiplier, could be beneficial, but I need to be cautious about my slots and overall strategy.\n**Planning purchases and actions**\n\nWith $9, I can buy the Buffoon and Celestial packs for $8, leaving me with $1, which seems fine. However, the Chariot is valuable for any deck, so it’s tempting to get it. I might buy the Buffoon pack first to secure the Joker, then see what I have left. Also, I could earn interest by waiting until the end of the next round, but spending now feels right.\n\nMy first action will be to buy the Buffoon pack, and I need to think about how the system will prompt me to choose from the options after. If the pack offers two Jokers, I can pick one, applying it if it's a base edition. So, I’ll respond with JSON action to buy the booster.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
