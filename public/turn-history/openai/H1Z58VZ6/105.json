{"reasoning":"**Evaluating boss reroll strategy**\n\nWe're at boss blind ante5, needing 22,000 chips, but the boss is debuffing club cards. Rerolling costs $10, with my current funds at -3 and credit down to -20. Deciding to reroll depends on how dangerous the boss's effect is. The debuff disables about a quarter of the deck's chip values, but base hand and joker effects still apply. The scoring components remain crucial, especially with Blue Joker’s +110 chips and other jokers enhancing multipliers.\n**Considering scoring options**\n\nCompared to our 7,000 hands, losing a few card chips might not matter much. However, we need to remember that debuffed cards can't trigger enhancements like multipliers. We need a total of 22,000 chips, and historically, our full houses score around 7,500, with pairs about 4,800. With four hands per round (maybe five with the grabber), reaching 22,000 seems manageable without rerolling. Rerolling costs $10 and would only worsen my debt. So, I’ll stick with my current strategy and play_round. I might rearrange the jokers, ensuring the best order!\n**Planning joker usage**\n\nI’m considering the order of joker triggers from left to right: if I want the multiplier first, I'll use Square before Duo. The holographic edition of Square gives +10 multipliers, but I’m trying to figure out if it adds another +10 on top of what Square provides. It looks like there might be a total of +20, but the description is unclear. Regardless, I'll stick to the plan and play_round, aiming for a pair or a full house! I'll format this as Action JSON.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
