{"reasoning":"**Planning card order**\n\nI'm figuring out the order for cards. If Acrobat comes before Duo, it calculates (4+10)*3*2 the same as 84. If we add more additive multipliers later, I should prioritize those before any multipliers. Right now, I'm only looking at the additive ones, like Square's +10 and possibly others. So, I think the sequence will be Square, then Duo, and finally Acrobat. For now, I’m planning to buy card 2 (Acrobat). I need to ensure I execute that command correctly!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
