{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game options**\n\nI'm looking at the options for either playing or skipping small, weighing the benefits. If I skip small, I won't be able to shop until after the boss, but the coupon tag means my next shop would give free starter cards and booster packs, which is tempting since I'm low on money. Skipping now keeps me in the blind select for big. I wonder if I can manage the thresholds of chips needed with my current scoring and multipliers.\n**Clarifying chip bonuses**\n\nWait, it looks like Blue adds chips to my total independently, which is good! The Square seems to give a +10 multiplier and +24 chips, but I need to confirm if those 24 chips come from playing exactly 4 cards. The holographic edition also adds a +10 multiplier to the Joker and the Square. So, I think the total multiplier for Square could be +20 if I account for both its base and edition. I really need to keep my scoring consistent with these multipliers in mind!\n**Calculating straight chips**\n\nAlright, when it comes to straights, I'm starting with base chips, which I think is 30, plus card chips, potentially averaging around 5 each. In Balatro, each card has a chip value of 2-14, so I’ll estimate around 8. With 5 cards, that could be about 40 chips. Adding in the Blue’s +108 and Square’s +24, I think my total chips could be 202. Then, factoring in multipliers, I estimate I could reach 15,756 or even 21,816, which is pretty significant! One straight might help clear the small blind but maybe not the big one.\n**Analyzing boss strategy**\n\nI'm figuring out how to tackle the boss, which requires around 22,000 chips. It seems like I might need one high straight with 5 cards, especially if I have a holographic card, but the boss debuffs clubs, so some cards won't contribute chip values. That could lower my chip total. Still, I'm considering the risk of not drawing the straight. Since I could have five hands due to Grabber, playing small blind might net me $3, but skipping could give me a coupon for free cards and booster packs, which sounds way more beneficial!\n**Strategizing blind plays**\n\nI'm weighing my options here. If I play the big blind, I can earn $4, which would really help my economy. However, skipping means I get an economy tag that doubles my money (up to $40), but I'd miss out on that reward and shop. Skipping both blinds leads directly to the boss, but I'd get coupon freebies for the next shop if I win. I think I can take the boss with a solid strategy, so I’ll skip small to get that coupon, then play big. This could really pay off!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
