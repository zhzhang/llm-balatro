{"reasoning":"**Calculating scoring order**\n\nI'm considering the optimal scoring order for the jokers. I think the Blue Joker should come first because it adds chips, followed by the Square Joker, which likely adds chips and provides a multiplier. I notice the holographic edition of the Square Joker also adds to the multiplier, potentially totaling +20. \n\nIt's vital to apply the order correctly: first additive chips, then additive multipliers, and finally the multiplicative multipliers. So, we should aim to buy the Green Joker next and possibly rearrange afterward.\n**Planning the next action**\n\nAfter buying, I can rearrange, but I need to focus on one action at a time. The task suggests that buying the Green Joker first is the best move. I think I should calculate the finances: buying it will leave me at -20, which is allowable with the credit card. \n\nNow, I need to prepare a JSON action to buy the Green Joker, which corresponds to card position 2.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
