{"reasoning":"**Evaluating economy and scoring**\n\nI’m analyzing our economy: we have $9, and there's a potential $4 reward for big blind and $5 for the boss. The Do To List’s $4 per round looks strong, but replacing Scholar could be an issue since it offers significant multipliers, mainly on Aces. The current score for a high card Ace is 2070, while Scholar adds 20 chips and a +4 multiplier, which I think is worth keeping. Leveling up Straight could boost our chips and multipliers, but we seldom play straights.\n**Considering pair and straight strategies**\n\nI realize we have a strong pair engine, and straights could still be solid with Blue Joker chips. But maybe investing in a straight isn't necessary right now. I’m thinking it might be better to save money for a higher-quality joker, but with $3 being such a small amount, perhaps buying an Arcana pack for tarot upgrades is more appealing. Leveling up the straight might be useful in case we face constraints from the big blind or boss. However, since rerolling costs $5, I could consider that as well.\n**Assessing joker slots and packs**\n\nI’m realizing we’re at max joker slots, but I might still find a better replacement. Buying an Arcana pack for $4 seems like a strong option since it can enhance the deck with tarots. The Saturn planet doesn’t seem crucial. To switch up the To Do List, I'll grab the Arcana pack first to see what synergies I can create. The booster action will lead to a selection state, and I must decide between Arcana and Spectral packs. The Spectral pack could yield some big chances, but it also comes with risks.\n**Evaluating spectral and Arcana packs**\n\nI’m realizing that ectoplasm gives a Negative edition to a random joker and reduces my hand size by 1, which is tricky. The Spectral pack has interesting options: Ankh can duplicate a joker but destroy others, while Deja Vu adds a red seal to a selected card—this could really help. With my current build, using Deja Vu on an Ace would be powerful. I’m leaning toward the Spectral pack for its long-term potential, even though it comes with some risks, such as harm to my Blue Joker.\n**Deciding on packs and purchases**\n\nI’m looking at the Hex option, which can create a polychrome joker but destroys all others—definitely risky. The \"Ouija\" card could make all cards in hand the same rank but reduces hand size, so I’d want to avoid that too. Arcana seems like a safer choice. I’m thinking of buying the Arcana pack first since it leaves me with $5 to potentially buy Saturn later if needed. So, my next action will be to purchase the Arcana pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
