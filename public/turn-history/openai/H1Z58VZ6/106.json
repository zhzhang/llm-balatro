{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card combinations**\n\nI think it's best to play hands that include pairs or three-of-a-kinds because a full house contains both, which triggers Duo x2 and Wily +100. However, I realize a full house requires 5 cards, and it seems I can trigger a Square with exactly 4 cards played. So, I can still play 4-card hands, and scoring uses the best possible combination from those cards. Achieving 22,000 might be easiest with 5-card full houses, but it all depends on my draws. Wait, do I even have a pair in my starting hand?\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI have a hand with 9 spades, J hearts, 4 hearts, debuffed 7 clubs, K diamonds, Q diamonds, 9 diamonds, and a gold 3 of diamonds. There's a pair of 9s, which is great! I can form a 4-card hand with the pair plus two high cards, like K and Q, to trigger both Square and Duo. I should keep the 3 of diamonds for potential earnings but maybe hold on to the debuffed club since it doesn’t add value. Even if it scores no chips, it still counts towards my hand size and can serve as a kicker.\n**Choosing card combinations**\n\nI think I should use the pair of 9s along with two other cards, ideally low ones that won’t affect scoring. Since only the pair cards score chips and trigger effects, I might go with the debuffed 7 of clubs and the 4 of hearts. However, using a high card like K or Q could later help form pairs or straights, so I should keep those. Playing the 9s with the 7 clubs and 4 hearts will trigger the Square bonus, increasing its chips. Wait, does the Square Joker give chips equal to its current value too?\n**Calculating chip values**\n\nOkay, so the Joker gives +4 chips if the hand has exactly 4 cards, which means it could also add its value of +32 chips to the total. This suggests that when I play a 4-card hand, I increase its chip value by 4 after it’s played, likely independently. So for the first hand, I'd get +32 chips, bringing it to 36 after resolving. Adding in the +10 from holo and +94 from Blue, with Duo x2, this may yield around 184 chips total.\n**Finalizing chip calculations**\n\nI start with a base multiplier of 4 and add +10 from the holo Square, bringing it to 14. Then, with Duo x2, that totals 28. So, my final chips would be 184 multiplied by 28, leading to around 5,152 chips. That sounds plausible since earlier pair scores were around 4,800. To reach 22k, I can aim for 4 or 5 hands like this. For my first play, I'll keep the gold card for $3 gain and play the two 9s, the 4 of hearts, and the 7 of clubs. I’ll output the action in JSON as [1, 3, 4, 7].\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,7]"}
