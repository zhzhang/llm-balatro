{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip strategy**\n\nI'm currently in a boss mode, striving for 22,000 chips. Right now, I have 10,472 chips, leaving me needing 11,528 more in three hands, which averages out to about 3,843 chips per hand. My pair strategy expects about 5,200 points from a 4-card pair. My current hand includes a pair of 7s, so I’ll play those along with two non-useful cards to keep my options open for a potential flush later. But if I use a 5-card flush, I won't trigger my duo!\n**Evaluating flush and scoring**\n\nI realize a flush doesn't include a pair unless there's also a pair present. So, if I play a flush of diamonds with 7D, QD, 10D, 4D, and 3D, that's a flush, but there's no pair and my duo won't be active. \n\nFor scoring, the base flush at level 2 gives me 50 chips, plus the total value of the cards, which adds up to 84 chips. There’s also the Blue chip, which may add extra points, and then I need to consider how the square and holographic edition multipliers work too!\n**Calculating multiplier contributions**\n\nI want to back-calculate to figure out the actual multiplier contributions. For a pair hand at level 3, the base is 40 chips with a multiplier of 4. \n\nWith my 9 pairs scoring 5,264 chips, including blue and square contributions, I need to clarify how all these multipliers work together. The total multiplier seems to be based on several components: the base, square, holographic additions, and the duo effect. \n\nWhen I break down the combinations, I find discrepancies in my totals, leading me to reconsider how the square chips may or may not be adding to my total.\n**Clarifying square and multiplier effects**\n\nI realize that the square description indicates it gains +4 chips if the hand has exactly 4 cards, which means it's adding 40 chips independently. There's also a +10 multiplier from the holographic edition, not from the square itself. \n\nThe secondary description seems to attribute the +10 multiplier solely to the holographic edition, while the square contributes directly to the chips. With this in mind, my multipliers and calculations for both pairs and flushes seem to align closely with previous estimations.\n**Calculating play strategy**\n\nI’m summing up my chip values: 7 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 3 equals a total of 34 chips. Adding blue chips gives me 162, and including square chips results in 202. The square always adds its current chips, even if my hand has more than 4 cards. \n\nFor my pair of 7s, I’m choosing fillers like K♣ and 4D. I want to keep potential future cards for pairs or straights. For scoring, I estimate about 4,800 chips from my pair, which should help me reach my goal of needing 6,712 chips over two hands.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,6,7]"}
