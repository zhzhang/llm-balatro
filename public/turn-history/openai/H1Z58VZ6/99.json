{"reasoning":"**Considering shop options**\n\nI need to decide on the next action in the shop, which is currently empty. I can reroll for $5, and I have $11, but using a credit card could let me go to -$20. Rerolling may give me chance for rarer cards like jokers or vouchers. However, since I've filled my joker slots, I’d need to sell one to buy a new one. It seems reasonable to reroll at least once to see what I can find for the upcoming boss. Rearranging my jokers might also be key.\n**Arranging joker order**\n\nI'm thinking about the independent jokers: Blue provides chips, Square gives chips plus a +10 multiplier, Duo doubles if I have a pair, and Order triples with a straight. To maximize my hands, I should maximize the order of activation since they trigger from left to right. \n\nThe key is applying multiplier effects in the right sequence: additive multipliers, like what Square provides, should come before the multiplicative ones like Duo and Order. I’ll rearrange them now for the best outcome.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI’m considering my actions and thinking that I usually should take a single step, rather than multiple commands. I could rearrange my jokers first for optimization since that doesn’t cost anything. However, I might want to reroll first since it doesn’t depend on my current arrangement. My existing joker order is good, with Square placed before Duo and Order. So, the best next step seems to be the reroll at the shop. Sure, there’s a risk of spending money without finding items, but rerolling could reveal new options.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
