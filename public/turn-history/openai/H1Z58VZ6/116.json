{"reasoning":"**Evaluating jokers for debt relief**\n\nI need to choose between the Mail-In Rebate and the Faceless Joker for our buffoon pack since we just sold Wily. We're currently in a bit of debt, but the credit card allows for some flexibility. The Mail-In Rebate could be powerful if I can discard multiple cards of a specific rank each round to earn $5. On the other hand, if I can discard three or more face cards at once, the Faceless Joker is also appealing. I'll weigh which one might be more effective for our economic situation.\n**Analyzing discard strategies**\n\nWith the Faceless Joker, I need to discard three or more face cards to trigger earnings, which seems manageable since there are 12 face cards in a standard deck. But since I have limited discards per round, I can only max out at $15 if I manage that successfully. The Mail-In Rebate could earn more if I can target multiple ranks in a single discard, potentially hitting $30. Given our current debt, I'm leaning toward consistent income with the Faceless Joker, but managing discards is tricky, especially with our hand-building strategy.\n**Evaluating card discard strategy**\n\nI’m starting to think we might not need to rely heavily on discards if the scores come in well enough. Both economy jokers and the Square Joker are important, with the latter needing exactly four cards, which is manageable. With a 55-card deck, drawing specific ranks may become trickier, which could affect Mail-In's consistency. With about 12 face cards, the chance of drawing three in an 8-card hand seems moderate, around 30%, but it’s not guaranteed unless deck changes add more face cards.\n**Analyzing Mail-In Rebate potential**\n\nWith the Mail-In Rebate, I’m considering how many cards of a given rank there might be in a 55-card deck. If I expect to see about four duplicates, that gives me an approximate chance of 44% to draw at least one in my 8-card hand. This translates to about $3 per discard, so with three discards, I could expect $9. However, since ranks change each round, I can’t fully plan for that. I still need scoring jokers for later, but I think we can manage with what we have.\n**Choosing Mail-In Rebate**\n\nConsidering our debt situation, I think the Mail-In Rebate is the better choice since it has a potentially higher yield per round and doesn’t require three face cards at once. I can intentionally discard the target rank when it appears. The Faceless Joker might offer more control if I can store and then discard three face cards, but that could be challenging with a larger deck. Plus, I need funds for celestial packs, making Mail-In Rebate the more practical option. So, I'll go ahead and select card 1, the Mail-In Rebate.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
