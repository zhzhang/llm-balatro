{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card possibilities**\n\nI previously had a high card of 2070 with some conditions in play. If I have a high card with Ace, it might yield around 2000, which isn’t enough. I'm wondering if I can form a straight with A, 2,? I could attempt a four-card hand to trigger the Square Joker, but it permanently gives only +4 chips and a +10 multiplier, which may apply to the holographic aspect too. Since I already have 20 chips, discarding cards could help me find a pair, but it uses a discard. Since the boss draws seven cards face down, discarding might lead to losing unknowns, yet it could help create a visible pair.\n**Determining card strategy**\n\nI need 2736 points, which I might achieve with a straight using Order for maybe 7000 points, but I'd need a visible straight. Alternatively, I could play two pair or three of a kind, though that feels uncertain. Since I have four hands available, I can play it safe and use one discard to look for matching ranks. Even without a pair, I can play a high card. Winning in fewer hands is financially beneficial, so I want to win using one of the four hands remaining. If I win the next hand, I’ll have three left, bringing in extra money. I should aim to construct a hand likely to score over 2736 with reasonable certainty, maybe starting with a base pair level three, worth 40 chips with a multiplier of four.\n**Calculating chip values**\n\nI’m computing the card chips from the pair ranks, like a pair of 10s contributing their chip value. The Blue Joker appears to add 82 chips, as it states +2 chips for each remaining card in the deck. This likely increases the total chip count independently. The Square Joker provides a +10 multiplier, and I’m wondering if the holo adds another +10. It seems the base effect for the Square Joker gives scaling chips, while the holo adds extra. The state description mentions a secondary effect, but it feels a bit unclear. The last full house score of 7264 suggests a particular calculation I need to verify further.\n**Evaluating scoring mechanics**\n\nThe duo gives a x2 multiplier if the hand contains a pair, including two pairs or full houses, while order gives a x3 for a straight. If I have a pair, I’ll get x2 but not x3. For a high card, there’s a base of 15 with an additional 11 for an ace, only if it’s in hand. If square adds chips, I should consider their values. That's likely 128 chips total, but when applied to the multiplier, I end up with a score of 1536, which isn't enough. The previous high card was 2070, possibly due to the blue joker value. If I use a pair of face cards, the chips could total 162. With a multiplier of 28, I could score 4536.\n**Planning discard strategy**\n\nAlright, for a pair of low cards, my chip total is 186, which with the right multipliers could score enough. I need to assess my unknown cards—since there are duplicates possible, I might improve my hand odds by discarding. The deck has 41 cards left, and while I can aim for a pair, I also need to be careful about the possible risk of forming a straight. \n\nTo maximize my chances, I plan to discard some unknowns along with a couple of less useful visible cards. My current action will involve discarding positions 1 (5♠), 4, 5, 7, and 8 (2♦), keeping A♥, J♥, K♦, which will set me up for strong potential draws. I’ll proceed with my discard action.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,7,8]"}
