{"reasoning":"**Deciding game strategy**\n\nI’ve just bought Director's Cut but I'm left with only $1. I’m thinking about whether to sell a joker to buy Clever, but weighing my options: I could sell Blue for $4 to get $5, which allows me to buy Clever, but I’d only have $1 left. Clever isn’t consistent enough for my build's synergy of straight and pairs. Selling Duo doesn't seem smart either, so I’ll just move to the round select phase.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
