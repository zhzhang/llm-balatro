{"reasoning":"**Evaluating credit card strategy**\n\nI realize a credit card allows going below zero, but I'm unsure what happens if I remove it while in the negative. The game probably prevents selling if it would push me further into debt. It might just reset my money to zero, which feels risky. \n\nSince we're approaching a boss, we could need discards. Buying DG increases debt, making it less valuable in the short term. I think I should focus on the round select to tackle the boss next.\n**Arranging joker multipliers**\n\nI'm thinking about the order of jokers for independent multipliers. In that category, the order does matter because multiplication and addition aren’t commutative. I should add multipliers first and then apply any multiplications since that maximizes the total effect. \n\nIt looks like the Blue joker adds chips independently, while the Square gives a +10 multiplier and chips based on specific conditions. Duo gives a x2 multiplier for a pair, and Wily offers +100 chips for three of a kind. The credit card doesn't have an effect here.\n**Sorting jokers for maximum effect**\n\nI realize the optimal order for applying multipliers is to add the +mult before the xmult. So, I should have Square (+10 mult) before The Duo (x2 mult) in the joker list, which it already is. Wily's chips don't affect multipliers, so its position might not matter much. \n\nChips and multipliers operate independently, meaning their order doesn't impact the outcome. Since the only x mult is Duo and + mult is Square, I should consider if selling a joker could help me return to a positive balance.\n**Weighing options for selling jokers**\n\nI have the option to sell Wily for $2, boosting my money from -3 to -1. Selling the Credit Card for $1 could also be an option, but I’m worried selling it while negative might mess things up or remove my ability to clear the debt. Selling Wily lowers my scoring for three of a kind, but I mainly rely on pairs and full houses. \n\nWily does add chips to full houses, which is helpful. Plus, Square gives a +10 multiplier and scaling chips when played with four cards. Our best scores were around 7k for a full house and 4.8k for a pair. I’m also curious about the boss blind!\n**Deciding on boss reroll strategy**\n\nI realize we might need to save for a boss reroll using the Director's Cut, but that costs $10, and we're currently in debt at -3. Selling jokers like Blue, Square, or Duo could raise funds, but that risks losing important multipliers. \n\nTo reach $10 from -3, I'd need to increase by +13. Selling Square and Blue would give me that amount, leaving Credit and Wily. However, I think it's better to keep the Credit Card for the boss reroll, allowing me to go negative. I should skip buying DG to ensure I have room for the reroll instead. So, I’ll go with round_select for now.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
