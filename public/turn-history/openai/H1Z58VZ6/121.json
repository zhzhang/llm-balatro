{"reasoning":"**Analyzing credit card strategy**\n\nWhen I think about the credit card, it lets me go up to -$20 in debt, but if I lose it and I'm at -20, the game might not force me below zero — it just prevents future purchases. I’m considering keeping the credit card since it could help later. Selling it would give $1 and free a joker slot, but currently, there’s no better card available. We might want to rethink selling Blue or Square since they are essential for our strategy.\n**Finalizing card order**\n\nI’m thinking that the multiplicative effects should come last, so Duo needs to be positioned there. I’m also considering if moving Green before Square makes a difference since Square provides +10 multiplier and holo adds another +10. The holo addition gives a total of +20 multiplier. \n\nIn this case, the order of additive multipliers doesn’t matter, but for multiplicative effects, it’s crucial to have them come after add-ons to maximize benefits. It looks like our current order is good, so I'll proceed with round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
