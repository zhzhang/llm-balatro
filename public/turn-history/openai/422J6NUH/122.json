{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI’m considering how a more powerful first card, like a mult card or a lucky card, could impact the game. Without modifying the deck, the effects might be limited. The Juggler card increases my hand size to 9, which could enhance my consistency for flushes. However, the Wrathful card gives +3 multipliers per spade, so I need to ensure I have a spade flush to benefit. I could explore straights too, but we’re not currently using them in our game.\n**Considering card options**\n\nI'm thinking that a reroll in the shop might be better to find a tarot or joker card, as I could lose flush bonuses otherwise. The boss, \"The Arm,\" might reduce hand levels, which could complicate things. I've got $11, so I could spend $5 to reroll and still keep $6 for interest. However, not buying anything would leave me at the round select with that same amount. The ante level is high, and I may also need to consider investing in upgrades, like Jupiter, but they aren't available right now.\n**Planning the reroll**\n\nI think rerolling might help me find Jupiter or a celestial pack, which could be beneficial. Since I just purchased a Blank voucher to unlock Antimatter later, I have $11 and no consumables right now. I’ll reroll once to look for a flush planet or tarot card. I must remember I can buy Mars for $3, but since four of a kind isn’t in use, my action will be to perform a reroll in the shop. I’ll format the response in the required JSON format for the action.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
