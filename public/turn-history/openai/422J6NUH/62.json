{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop choices**\n\nI’m in the shop after the big blind, but there’s an ante in round five. We bought Even Steven, and now the only item left is the 8 Ball. With $20, the reroll costs $7, and I have Jokers full and a Consumable Empress. It seems like getting the 8 Ball isn’t the best choice since it doesn’t match my flush build needs. I might reroll for planet Jupiter or better jokers, but my slots are full. Maybe I can sell Greedy instead.\n**Analyzing reroll costs**\n\nThe reroll cost is high at $7, which means with my $20, I can afford just two rerolls, leaving me with only $5 afterward. So, it might be better to save. I think the boss comes after round five, so I should prepare for the blind select. Using Empress in the round could be a good option. I’m hesitant about buying the 8 Ball, even at $5; crafting a deck around 8s feels uncertain. I might also need to rearrange my jokers for optimal effects and consider their trigger order.\n**Understanding scoring triggers**\n\nEven Steven and Greedy work as 'on scored' triggers with played cards affecting scoring from left to right, followed by jokers in the same direction. The order of Greedy and Even Steven may not matter since they both trigger during step three. They simply add to the total multiplicatively. However, Droll's x1.5 is independent and should be applied afterward; this means the order in which I apply additive and multiplicative effects matters. In Balatro, independent jokers also activate left to right, so if I can manage that order, I could optimize my scores effectively.\n**Ordering joker effects**\n\nI need to ensure that all additive sources play before the xmult effects, like Droll’s x1.5, which might be best positioned on the right to multiply after other effects. Gros Michel adds +15 as an independent source, while Crafty adds chips that don’t impact the multiplier. The ideal order seems to be Crafty, Gros Michel, and then Droll. Even though Greedy and Even Steven are on-scored, the order among them may still influence how retriggers work, so keeping them on the left is probably wise. Total chips should adjust before any multiplication.\n**Finalizing the chip and multiplier order**\n\nIn my final calculation, chips and multipliers are separate; adding chips doesn't affect the multiplier until the final multiplication. Effects can independently add chips and multipliers in their own categories. Crafty adds +80 chips as an independent source, positioning it before Droll’s x1.5 multiplier. The current order is Greedy, Crafty, Gros Michel, and Droll, with Even Steven being on-scored, so its timing doesn't change much for the multipliers. I think my order is acceptable, and it looks like I'm ready to proceed to the round select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
