{"reasoning":"**Strategizing card discards**\n\nI’m strategizing my card game moves. We’re initially faced with 5 face-up cards and 2 unknowns while needing to reach 70k in 4 hands. Previous flush hands got us 31k and 48k, but this current hand is unlikely to be flush. I’m thinking it’s best to discard the unknown cards first to gain full information about the hand. I have 4 discards left over 4 hands, so I'll discard two cards in positions 6 and 7. Let's see what comes next!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [6,7]"}
