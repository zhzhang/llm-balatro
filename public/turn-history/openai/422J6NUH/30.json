{"reasoning":"**Considering skip tags**\n\nI’m analyzing the \"skip tag\" which seems to offer $5 for each blind skipped, potentially giving $20 at the end of the shop. However, I need to consider skipping the big blind means I won't have a chance to shop until after the boss.\n\nBut skipping the boss isn't an option. If I skip small first, I could still get an uncommon joker and then decide if skipping big for $20 is worthwhile. There are lots of options to weigh!\n**Evaluating the skip tag benefits**\n\nI realize we’ll only get one shop after the boss, which is fine. The total money might be $2 plus $20 from the skip tag, plus a $5 reward from the boss. However, I need to make sure that the money from the skip tag is credited immediately when I skip the big blind.\n\nIt seems like skipping gives the tag's effect right away, potentially adding $5, since it triggers during the skip screen. This could set me up nicely!\n**Analyzing the skip tag value**\n\nI’m digging into the \"will give $20\" statement, which suggests it’s based on skipping blinds, possibly including this one plus the small blind. But if I only skip small, that totals to just $10, not $20. \n\nMaybe I didn’t skip any blinds earlier—the available tags don’t show any. So, if I haven’t skipped before, the current tag value might reflect my overall game progress. I wonder if it’s counting skips or something else entirely. I need to clarify that!\n**Weighing options for skipping blinds**\n\nI’m considering that skipping a blind might grant $5 each time, with four blinds left. However, I think the safest route might be to play the small blind for $3 to ensure a shop afterward. If I win with that, I could head to the shop with a total of $5.\n\nBut then, I’d miss out on a potentially valuable free uncommon joker, which could help with my flush build. In that case, I should probably skip the small blind for the joker, and then I can consider skipping the big blind afterward for the potential $20. Yet, skipping big would delay my shop until after the boss!\n**Strategizing blind plays**\n\nI’m realizing the big blind may not be necessary since I can beat the boss anyway, and the potential $20 is more beneficial than just $4 from the big blind. However, having an extra shop would let me buy boosters or planets. If I skip small, I wouldn’t gain any money from it, still sticking with $2.\n\nBy playing the big blind, I could earn $4 plus additional hands, reaching around $7-$10. But if I skip the big for $20, that would give me a significant $22 for purchases! So, the plan is to skip the small blind for a free uncommon and then decide whether to skip the big blind for $20. I’ll proceed with skipping the small blind now!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
