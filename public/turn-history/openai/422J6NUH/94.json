{"reasoning":"**Considering shop options**\n\nI have $6 in a shop where the reroll costs $5. The only item is the Credit Card joker for $1, but I've already filled my joker slots, so it's not useful right now. Selling a weak joker could allow me to buy it, but I can’t exceed my maximum. Rerolling might unlock a better option, but I'd be left with just $1. I wonder if I should buy the Credit Card, even with its slot cost, for potential future buys.\n**Evaluating trade-offs**\n\nI could sell Crafty or Even Steven for $2 and buy the Credit Card joker for $1, which would leave me with $7. But wait, I only have $6 now, so selling brings me to $8, then buying takes me back to $7. The Credit Card lets me go into debt, but it doesn’t help with scoring just yet. Maybe it’s better to reroll for something new? With only $6, the reroll costs $5, which only allows for one try. Keeping the $6 for the next shop might be wiser.\n**Analyzing joker mechanics**\n\nI'm examining Droll, which adds +10 multiplier if there's a flush and a secondary x1.5 multiplier, possibly independent. It seems to trigger in the independent category, giving that +10 and an x1.5 boost. Crafty does something similar, providing +80 chips if a flush is played. Since both jokers add chips and multipliers, the order might not matter much, but it seems logical to prioritize the additive first. Droll definitely offers both effects, and I'm realizing its mechanics in the polychrome edition might give a consistent x1.5 multiplier too.\n**Determining multiplier order**\n\nI see that Droll offers a consistent x1.5 multiplier and also has a secondary x1.5 description. If the order of activation matters, I guess I should prioritize adding Droll's +10 multiplier before any x1.5 multipliers. Currently, I only have Droll with that benefit, while others seem to give chips. I realize that Even Steven gives a multiplier during scoring, which means Droll’s effects may stack harmoniously later. Overall, it looks like Droll should remain last among the independent options!\n**Deciding on reroll vs. cashing out**\n\nI'm looking at Hanging Chad, which retriggers the first scored card, and I realize its position among the jokers really matters here. It belongs to a retriggering category, but since it's the only one, the order isn't crucial. My main choice is between rerolling or staying put. I could fish for better cards, but with $6 and my jokers full, finding a great joker might be tough. However, I could sell some to make room. Given the upcoming boss at Ante 5, I think rerolling now could be worthwhile, especially if I might get Jupiter for just $3!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
