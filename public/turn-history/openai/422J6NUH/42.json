{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card pack options**\n\nI’m considering buying a standard pack for four, which leaves me with 18 interest. By my calculations, 18 gives 3 interest and spending four could lose one. But improving the deck might still be worth it. The mega pack costs eight and leaves 14 interest—losing two instead. Alternatively, I could reroll the shop at six to find planet cards or jokers, but there are no joker slots left. This makes me think about the best way to improve my deck without overspending.\n**Reevaluating card options**\n\nI'm considering whether to prioritize increasing my flush base with the planet card Jupiter, which only appears in Celestial packs. Since I have no boosters for Celestial, it might be smarter to reroll in hopes of finding a Celestial pack or planet card in the shop. The shop usually has joker slots and consumables, so rerolling could provide better options. While I have a good joker lineup, I wonder if replacing Greedy with a better joker could be worth it. But the cost of rerolling is something I need to keep an eye on!\n**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nI'm considering whether to reroll, but I remember that in Balatro, reroll costs increase with each attempt, which complicates things. Since the Flash card is no longer available, I might do just one reroll. However, maybe buying a Mega Standard pack could be a better choice. Ultimately, my best option seems to be rerolling the shop to search for the Jupiter planet card or tarot to enhance my flushes, since that's a significant part of my build!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
