{"reasoning":"**Evaluating chip options**\n\nI've got a huge multiplier from Droll polychrome and Gros Michel, but I'm noticing some issues with scaling chips. Crafty could give me +80 chips on flush, and adding Banner seems like a smart move for chip multiplication since I have an empty slot. \n\nI'm considering buying Banner for $5. The Red Card doesn’t look great for scaling, and I might save money for later. Maybe buying the Jumbo Buffoon pack could give me a stronger joker? I have possibilities, but I need to think it through.\n**Analyzing card pack choices**\n\nI'm considering the Arcana pack since it could improve my deck with tarot cards that might help with flushes. I also have a Magic Trick voucher to buy playing cards, but I'm not sure what’s currently available. \n\nIt looks like I might take Jumbo Arcana for something like The Sun or Strength. My strategy needs to adapt since I have around 18k in flush wins but need to scale higher. Buying the buffoon pack seems like a good option, and I can manage my money to buy both Banner and Buffoon effectively.\n**Considering shop strategies**\n\nI'm contemplating buying Overstock for more options, but spending $10 will drop my interest to 3. I see the potential benefit in more shop slots for finding better jokers. Since I'm currently at ante 5, buying Overstock might be a smart long-term investment, especially as I’m midway through my run. I realize I'll have multiple shops to access after each ante, so the selection could be worth it. I could buy both Banner and Overstock while still keeping enough funds for future needs.\n**Weighing my options on purchases**\n\nRerolls cost $5, so I want to keep at least $25 for interest and flexibility. With $33, I could buy Banner and still have $28 left, which is good. Then, I can also get the Buffoon pack to use my empty slot, but I might find a great joker and fill that slot instead. \n\nI’m now considering whether to buy Banner first, which would fill my jokers, making me sell to take a new joker later. Opening Buffoon first could let me add a new joker without needing to sell. So maybe I'll go that route!\n**Deciding on booster purchases**\n\nBuying the Banner may be worthwhile, but if the Buffoon pack offers an amazing joker, I might prefer that instead. If I fill my slot with Buffoon's joker, I could still buy Banner later, but I'd be at 5/5 jokers, which means I'd need to sell something to get Banner. \n\nSo, it might be best to open the Buffoon pack first while keeping the slot open, allowing me to choose the best option and then decide if Banner is worth replacing. My immediate action should be to buy the Jumbo Buffoon pack! I'll go with that and set the action to buy_booster for position 1.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
