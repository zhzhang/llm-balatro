{"reasoning":"**Planning the play round**\n\nI'm in a blind select boss situation, and apparently, I can't skip it. I have to play a round. Since I don't have any consumables or jokers to help me out, I think my only option is to go ahead and play the round. I'll need to provide a response according to the action schema. This should keep things moving forward, even though it's a bit of a tough spot!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
