{"reasoning":"**Assessing card strategy**\n\nI’m at the stage of selecting hand and need to reach 52,500 chips in big blind. Currently, I have a hand with five hearts, A♥ J♥ 8♥ 7♥ 6♥, and I'm considering maximizing my options by keeping 6♥. This could help me maintain a heart flush while also benefiting from the gold card, 9♦. However, I must play exactly those five cards, leaving 2 in hand. My focus is on the order of cards played for optimal scoring.\n**Choosing even cards for scoring**\n\nI’m considering my options for maximizing chips through scoring. The 8♥ is an even card, which may work well with the Even Steven multiplier, allowing me to score more. With Even Steven, playing cards of even rank will give me an additional +4 multiplier each time they're scored. Since I want those retriggers to also be even-ranked, the 8♥ is my best bet due to its higher chip value compared to the 2♥. This could lead to significant scoring!\n**Determining multipliers and order**\n\nI'm weighing my options for scoring based on multipliers. I see that a total of +16 is possible with the 8♥, while retriggering A might not give a multiplier but offers more chips. I think the multiplier is more valuable, so I’ll set the 8♥ first. The Droll Joker can trigger a +10 multiplier if I have a flush, and it has an added layer of complexity with the polychrome edition providing x1.5 multiplier. The order of my jokers seems crucial, as they interact differently during scoring!\n**Evaluating joker effects during scoring**\n\nI’m thinking about the position of jokers in relation to Even Steven during card scoring. Since Even Steven triggers as soon as cards are scored, its position may influence the sequence and effectiveness of other jokers. If Even Steven is placed first, it could trigger earlier, impact subsequent scores, but since the multiplier is the key, I don't think order matters much. I’m also weighing the option of discarding 9♦ to draw another heart, but the best move might be to play for a flush to aim for a big score.\n**Analyzing flush scoring and options**\n\nI’m reflecting on my earlier flush score, which was likely boosted by some good cards and Steel. I'll start estimating my current flush and calculating expected chips. The base level gives me 95, plus card contributions total 133. The 8♥ retriggers nicely for additional chips, while the Droll Joker could add significant multipliers. However, looking at my current hand, it seems tough to reach 52,500 in one hand. It might be wiser to plan for two flushes across four hands instead! I also need to rearrange the hand to prioritize the 8♥ for optimal scoring.\n**Deciding on card arrangement and triggers**\n\nI'm considering the value of the cards for scoring and how Even Steven triggers with even cards. The 2♥ could be retriggered first, but since the 8♥ provides more chips and the same multiplier, it makes sense to use the 8♥ instead. Holding onto the 9♦ and 6♥ seems advantageous as well, but I’ll need to rearrange my hand to ensure the 8♥ is first. I plan to rearrange my hand to the order of 8♥, A♥, J♥, 7♥, 6♥, and 2♥, before playing.\n","action":"\"rearrange_hand\"\nPositions: [3,1,2,4,5,6,7]"}
