{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop strategy**\n\nI’m facing some choices in the shop. I have 5 jokers, $10, and I need to consider my options carefully. The shop offers a Credit Card for $1, a Standard pack for $4, and rerolls for $5. Our deck strategy is strong, but I need scaling for higher antes. Should I go for a Standard pack to add cards or reroll for potentially better jokers? Selling a weaker joker might be necessary to keep my options open.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI'm considering how Hanging Chad works; it retriggers the first scored card twice, which is great if I have enhancements. Without those, it just adds base chips. Retriggering Even Steven could yield more chips too. Droll is strong with its multiplier. I see that I might want to replace Crafty or Even Steven through rerolls for better jokers. Buying a Credit Card could use a joker slot, so it’s probably better to reroll and maybe sell Crafty to create some space.\n**Considering rerolls and purchases**\n\nI’m weighing whether to reroll, but I might regret it if the outcome is bad. For $5 each, I can reroll twice with my $10, but if I sell a joker now, I risk losing power for the next round. I could hold off until after, but I need to make decisions before the next blind. Buying a Standard pack for $4 seems like a safe bet since it adds a card to my deck without needing a slot. I still have options to reroll and check other cards in the shop.\n**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nRight now, the only option is the Credit Card, but a reroll could help me find planet cards to enhance my flush. The Standard pack seems limited to just playing cards, so I’m leaning toward buying it first, then possibly rerolling with $5. If I find a strong planet like Jupiter, I could buy and use it. I have a max of 2 consumables, so I could buy the planet and hold on to it. My next action? I’ll buy the Standard Pack to strengthen my deck!\n**Calculating score boosts**\n\nWith Even Steven, every even card I score adds +4 to my multiplier, so with 5 even cards, that's a total of +20, bringing my multiplier to 44. Crafty provides a solid bonus of +80 chips on top of the base chips I can get from ranked cards. Using this multiplier gives a huge scoring potential! The Standard pack allows me to choose cards, like hearts or even cards. I think I should go ahead and buy it!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
