{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI'm in the shop after a reroll and have the option for The Empress (tarot) and 2 of Clubs. The Empress can enhance two selected cards to become multiplier cards, adding +4 when scored, which is strong for any flush build. However, I need to select two cards to use it, and buying the tarot doesn't allow for direct targeting with the command I have. I can buy the Empress for $3 and it's worth it since I have no consumables. I’ll skip the 2 of Clubs as it’s not useful for my flush consistency.\n**Analyzing reroll decisions**\n\nI'm considering whether to reroll further for Jupiter or a better joker; the cost is now $6, and I have $31. I realize that interest at the end of the round hinges on my money after the shop phase. Since I'm already in the shop, the remaining amount after purchases will affect next round's interest. If I buy The Empress for $3, my total will drop to $28 and I’d still get $5 interest. However, if I keep my $31, I’ll earn $6 interest instead. Yet The Empress seems worth it. I might buy it and then reroll for Jupiter, but I’m weighing that against holding onto my money for the upcoming boss.\n**Deciding on card purchase**\n\nI think I can still clear with a flush, but to advance to higher antes, I need planets and better jokers. Buying The Empress will really help. I also remember that Saturn and Mercury were available before, but the reroll removed them, so I can't get them without another reroll. So, my action is clear: I’m going to buy The Empress card! That's going to strengthen my hand moving forward.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
