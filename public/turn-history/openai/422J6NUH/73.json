{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker options**\n\nWe're currently at a shop with five full jokers, and I need to decide whether to buy Banner and Red Card jokers, an Arcana pack, or an Overstock voucher. Our build is focused on making flushes, like with Crafty adding +80 chips and Droll giving a +10 multiplier. \n\nBanner could give us an extra +30 chips for each discard, which is a notable boost every hand, but I'd need to replace an existing joker. Maybe Even Steven is less consistent, while Wee Joker might be valuable long-term.\n**Weighing investment options**\n\nI’m analyzing the benefits of different jokers and packs. Gros Michel gives a +15 multiplier but can break easily, while Droll provides a strong x1.5 multiplier with a +10 for flushes. Crafty helps generate chips. Banner consistently scales with discards, which is appealing. \n\nRed Card isn’t fitting our current strategy, and even though the Arcana pack could boost our deck, it feels more immediate. I need to keep an eye on interest rates too, since anything over $2 could reduce my interest earnings.\n**Deciding on joker replacement**\n\nI’m at ante 5 and need to scale my chips. It might be worth spending now, even if I lose out on interest. I’m considering buying Banner and replacing Even Steven, but Even Steven does add a solid multiplier, with +4 for each even card in a flush. \n\nMeanwhile, Banner gives +30 chips per discard, which could add a significant amount. The potential boost from these chips when multiplied by my total multiplier could be substantial. I just need to weigh the benefits carefully!\n**Calculating chip contributions and multipliers**\n\nI’m figuring out card chips for a flush, where each card adds its rank value; Aces are 11 chips, Kings 10, and so on. I estimate the total chips from a flush might be around 30-40, adding to about 90 overall when I include Crafty's +80 chips. Banner could give another +90 if I have three discards, but I’m uncertain how many I’ll get each round.\n\nFor multipliers, starting with a base of 6, I can add contributions from Droll and Gros Michel, plus Even Steven based on even cards. I need to clarify if Droll’s x1.5 multiplier comes from the polychrome version or if that's inherent; there's a bit of confusion there!\n**Strategizing joker upgrades and tarot options**\n\nWith a flush strategy, I need either more multipliers or high chip sources. Even though the Wee Joker can yield big chips by including 2s, I’m considering maximizing that potential quickly with pairs of 2s. But it’s tricky to ensure consistency with them. \n\nThe Banner might give immediate chips, but depends heavily on discards that some bosses can limit. I’m leaning toward the Jumbo Arcana Pack for tarot cards, which could enhance my deck without taking up joker slots. \n\nWhile Banner provides short-term benefits, the long-term value from tarot cards seems to potentially outweigh it. Plus, having $27 gives me a little flexibility to invest wisely!\n**Planning deck enhancement**\n\nI'm thinking it might be wise to buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack first to improve my deck. This would give me immediate access to new tarot cards, and then I could consider selling or buying Banner later if needed. It looks like I’ll still have $21 after this purchase, and since the Banner should stay in the shop for later, I can go back if I want it. \n\nWith that in mind, my next action will be to go ahead and buy the Arcana Pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
