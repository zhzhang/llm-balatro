{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategies**\n\nI'm considering the benefits of different cards: Greedy offers multipliers for diamonds, while Supernova increases multipliers based on hands played. Flash only adds a small boost, so I think I’ll replace it with Gros. After purchasing, I might want to reroll for better jokers or planets, but it costs six. A booster pack for deck improvements sounds useful, even though we’re unsure of its contents. To maximize interest, I should aim to keep at least $25 on hand.\n**Considering spending strategies**\n\nI can justify spending on Gros for scaling while maintaining $20 to earn $4 in interest, which feels reasonable. Selling Flash for $2 and buying Gros for $5 would leave me with $22—so the loss isn't significant. I could also think about rerolling, but it costs $6 and scales Flash. If I aim for Jupiter instead, that could really enhance my scoring. However, if I reroll, I’d have only $19 left and a hit to my interest. Buying Gros first seems like the safer choice.\n**Planning my card actions**\n\nGros adds a significant +15 multiplier, while Flash only provides +2, which is minimal. I’m thinking about selling my joker for 5 and then buying a card, but I can’t buy unless I have a slot open. To create space, I should first sell my Flash card. After that, I can plan to buy Gros Michel next turn. However, since the Balatro UI won't let me buy if I’m full, I’ll focus on selling Flash first. I'm also considering which joker to sell based on suits, possibly targeting a diamond flush.\n**Evaluating card effectiveness**\n\nIt looks like Greedy only activates with diamonds, so if my flush is hearts, Greedy won't be helpful since mixing suits isn’t allowed. If we’re playing a hearts flush, there would be zero scored diamonds, making Greedy essentially useless. But if I have many diamonds, it might still work. Crafty and Droll provide flush benefits regardless of suit, which could make them stronger. Supernova, increasing with each flush played, seems more effective too. Gros, offering a steady +15, might be the better choice overall!\n**Assessing card options and actions**\n\nGreedy could provide a +15 multiplier with a diamond flush if I have five diamonds, but if my deck isn't diamond-heavy, that won't work. Magic Trick might help to buy diamonds, but it needs all diamonds for a flush. I’m thinking about the value of selling Flash to buy Gros since Gros gives an immediate +15. \n\nFlash might scale with rerolls, but at +2, it’s not strong. It’s really a complex decision! I should sell the joker in position 5 to free up a slot and then buy Gros. I'll make that my next action!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
