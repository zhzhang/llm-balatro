{"reasoning":"**Planning a flush strategy**\n\nI need to focus on creating a high-scoring flush. Right now, my hand consists of two hearts (Q, 8), two clubs (6 steel, 6 normal), an Ace of diamonds, a 9 of spades, and a stone. I'm not close to a flush, but I still have three discards left to improve my hand. With 15 diamonds in the deck, they seem like the best target, but I have an Ace of diamonds to consider for potential points. I'm thinking I should discard non-target suited cards.\n**Formulating a flush strategy**\n\nIn creating a flush, the first card played should be the highest scoring card to maximize chip value. I’m thinking to play the Ace first since it provides a +41 chip score, and if I retrigger with it, I could get 123 chips total! However, the stone can't be included in the flush because it has no suit, which makes it impossible to contribute. \n\nI need to decide between focusing on a diamond flush or discarding non-heart cards. The diamond flush requires me to draw four more diamonds while keeping the Ace.\n**Assessing flush probabilities**\n\nFor a flush, I need five diamonds played, but I can't include the steel club if I'm going for that. Keeping the Ace of diamonds is a good move, and I can discard everything else, unless I draw more diamonds. I calculated the probability of drawing four diamonds from the deck, which came to about 4.28%. For hearts, drawing at least three out of 11 gives me a probability around 9.65%, making it a more viable option. I can still use a second discard if needed.\n**Focusing on hearts flush strategy**\n\nWith three discards available, I’m leaning towards building a hearts flush, even though hearts are less abundant than diamonds. I already have two hearts in hand, and my goal is to reach 70k in four hands. A typical flush scored around 31k to 48k earlier.\n\nTo optimize my chances, I'll keep the Q and 8 of hearts and the steel 6 clubs for a multiplier. I'm considering whether to keep the Ace of diamonds; while it's not useful for a heart flush, it might help improve my draws if discarded. I need to maximize my heart draws since each discarded card could impact the probability.\n**Considering flush strategies**\n\nI’m weighing different approaches for building a flush. Discarding cards increases my chances of drawing more hearts, so I'm contemplating keeping two hearts and discarding others. Ideally, I want to draw at least three new hearts among my draws. The probability for that is around 4.54%, which feels low. \n\nAlternatively, I could go for a diamond flush, with a similar probability but keeping in mind the steel club's multiplier. It seems successful flushes are key to hitting my target of 70k! I’m focused on maximizing my discards while considering the values I'll need from my hands.\n**Maximizing flush potential**\n\nI'm focusing on building a heart flush by keeping two hearts while weighing the risks of losing the steel card. It seems like keeping steel could help with my score, but I also have four hands to work with, so if my first flush attempt doesn’t pan out, I can always try again with my discards. \n\nI could either discard four cards to draw new ones or possibly play a different hand with my non-heart cards to still score something. However, since flushes bring more potential score, I’ll likely aim for that by sticking with my two hearts.\n**Considering flush strategies**\n\nI'm weighing my options for aiming a flush while deciding on keeping steel and one heart, or even going for a diamond flush. It seems like I can discard five non-essential cards but still make a heart flush with good odds. However, I need to keep two hearts for that. \n\nI realize that while I can play a hand using non-heart cards, it might not score well. I can also play higher cards paired with my hearts for better chances. Yet, I have to balance that against the potential of scoring something valuable while ensuring I can still aim for the flush I need.\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nTo keep the steel card unplayed, I can only play four other cards while preserving both steel and hearts. This decision mirrors discarding four cards but might be more beneficial. Although I could play five cards to cycle, it consumes one hand, which is valuable! \n\nConsidering the need for two big flushes and scoring chances, I realize it's better to discard rather than use a hand. Discarding five non-heart cards makes sense, so my decision is to proceed with that!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,6,7]"}
