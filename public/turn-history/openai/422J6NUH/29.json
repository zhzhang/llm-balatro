{"reasoning":"**Evaluating Arcana pack strategy**\n\nI'm in a shop with $2, which means I can't buy anything costing $4 or more. The reroll cost is $5, so I'll select something from the current round. Maybe selling a joker would help me afford the Arcana pack? I could consider selling either Supernova or Greedy. I wonder if selling a joker for $2 would get me to $4 for that pack. I need to think about which joker to sell, considering my current hand strategy.\n**Analyzing Joker Decisions**\n\nGreedy is useful for diamond cards, but since I’m aiming for a consistent flush in one suit, I have to think strategically. The deck has a lot of diamonds (16 out of 39), making a diamond flush easier. If I go for that, Greedy gives a significant multiplier of +3 per diamond scored, potentially adding up to +15, which is substantial! Crafty and Droll also have great flush synergy. I’m considering selling Supernova for $2 to buy the Arcana pack, but is that worth it at this stage? Perhaps, the Arcana pack could bring valuable tarot cards, but I need to weigh that carefully.\n**Reassessing Tarot and Strategy**\n\nI realized that the Arcana pack is actually a tarot pack, which might help me convert suits to diamonds and take advantage of Greedy's bonuses. For instance, The Sun could convert three cards to diamonds. I could also proceed with my strong current setup and save up for better jokers later. With just $2, round selecting makes sense to earn more from upcoming rounds. Selling Supernova for the Arcana pack might yield suit conversions and improve my flush frequency, especially since my deck currently has many diamonds. Tarot could really enhance this!\n**Calculating Expected Value**\n\nI’m considering that if I skip shopping, I can still play the small blind and might earn some cash after the round. I think I’ll lean towards keeping Supernova. Let's estimate the expected value: with my current build, a flush leads to a huge multiplier. A base flush at level 2 gives me around 50 chips with a multiplier of 6. Adding chips from cards gives me even more. \n\nSo, without Greedy, my total multiplier could reach about 27, leading to 4,455 chips. If I account for Greedy and get a diamond flush, I'd be looking at a significant score, maybe even upward of 8,167 chips. Selling Supernova for the Arcana pack might enhance my score further, but I suspect I might already be at a high enough threshold right now.\n**Assessing Blind Requirements**\n\nI need to check the typical blind structure. For ante 3, I think it might be around 1,600, but it looks like the standard is actually Ante 1 with a small blind of 300, big blind of 450, and a boss blind at 600. For ante 2, it’s likely 600 for small, 900 for big, and 1,200 for the boss, needing 800 to qualify. The stakes are rising but not drastically. Since I can still play well with a flush, my best move seems to be to go for a round select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
