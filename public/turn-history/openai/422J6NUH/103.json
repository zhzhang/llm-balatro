{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop choices**\n\nI need to choose a shop action, and I’m anteing 6 with $8 available. I’ve got options like a flush-based build which includes Crafty for extra chips, and Droll for multipliers. \n\nIn the shop, I can get a 3 of spades card for $1, or a Red Card joker that scales with skipped boosters. But, the Joker Stencil needs empty slots to scale and I currently have all slots filled. If I buy it, I'd need to sell something, which could disrupt my synergy!\n**Clarifying the Joker Stencil**\n\nIt looks like the \"Joker Stencil included\" means it counts itself as occupied. But I wonder if it really affects the multiplier since it states \"X1 mult for each empty Joker slot,\" which likely doesn't consider itself as empty. If I'm in a full situation, that would make the multiplier zero, which would be terrible! This means I can't use it without creating empty slots by selling others. Having extra empty slots isn't ideal unless the Stencil provides significant scaling benefits, but maybe keeping 3 or 4 jokers could still work with my build.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI'm considering which cards to keep. I think I should maintain Droll, Even Steven, and Hanging Chad, maybe even Crafty or Juggler. If I drop Crafty and Juggler, keeping 3 jokers plus the Stencil would leave me with 1 empty slot, giving me only a multiplier of x1, which really doesn't help. To get x2, I’d need 2 empty slots, requiring me to run just 3 jokers. \n\nWhile some combinations seem potentially stronger, losing Crafty and Juggler might be tough since they add chips and improve consistency.\n**Making purchasing decisions**\n\nI need to make a decision. Since I'm anteing 6, the threshold is higher, and I’ll need more scaling. Right now, I'm getting about 13k per flush, but I need to upgrade that. Buying the Celestial pack for $4 seems good, and I might also get the Arcana pack for $6 to improve my deck with tarot cards—though I have only $8.\n\nI think I should choose the Celestial pack first to possibly level up my flush. It could improve base chips and the multiplier. The alternative option is to buy the Red Card for $5, but that wouldn’t help much since I typically don’t skip booster packs. A 3 of spades card for $1 isn’t particularly useful. \n\nOverall, I’m leaning toward grabbing the Celestial pack now!\n**Finalizing the purchase decision**\n\nI'm weighing the options again. The Arcana pack could be stronger, but I can't afford both packs. The Celestial pack is cheaper and directly powers the flush, which I rely on 90% of the time. So, it makes sense to buy the Celestial pack first.\n\nAfter that, I'll have $4 left. I can't reroll since that costs 5, and while I could buy the 3 of spades card for $1, it doesn't seem necessary. So, I’ll go ahead and purchase the Celestial pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
