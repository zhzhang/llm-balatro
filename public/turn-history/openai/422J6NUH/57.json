{"reasoning":"**Considering magic trick strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about a Magic Trick voucher that lets me buy playing cards. I wonder if I could buy diamonds after a reroll. The shop may include playing cards too, but not right now. Rerolling could unveil more cards. Ideally, I want more diamonds and an upgraded flush level, but that’s not possible yet. I should reroll, but I'm also considering the interest at the end of the round. I feel like it’s essential to have enough to beat the boss.\n**Planning for reroll outcomes**\n\nI'm considering what to do if the reroll gives me the joker I want. If that happens, I might sell Crafty and others to streamline my choices. So, my next action is to reroll at the shop and see what I get! It's a little nerve-wracking to think about what could come up, but I'm excited about the possibilities. Let's see if I can grab that joker this time!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
