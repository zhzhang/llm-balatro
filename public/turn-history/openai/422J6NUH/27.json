{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card packs**\n\nI’m considering that spending $6 seems too expensive for no real benefit. It feels smarter to opt for booster packs instead. The Arcana pack costs $4 and could potentially enhance my deck, while the Buffoon pack, also $4, might provide more jokers which could strengthen my flush build. With $6, buying one $4 pack leaves $2. I think the Buffoon pack offers better synergy, especially for early game jokers, so I’ll go with that.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
