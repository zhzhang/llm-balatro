{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shopping strategy**\n\nI'm in a shop, considering options for my flush-oriented joker setup. The multipliers for the cards are pretty interesting. Flush plays core, and I've got $46 to spend. The shop offers Saturn for straight level up and Mercury for pair level up, but they don't really align with my flush strategy. The Celestial Pack for $4 seems best because it might include Jupiter, which would improve my flush. I could also buy a Standard Pack to enhance my deck.\n**Considering shop strategy**\n\nI have a Magic Trick voucher that allows me to buy playing cards at the shop. Unfortunately, they don’t currently have jokers available, just planet cards. There's a reroll option for new jokers that costs $5, but I should focus on preparing for an upcoming boss with a high blind (20,000). Upgrading my flush with Jupiter from the Celestial Pack sounds like the best strategy. The pack costs less, and I'll choose one of three planets immediately. I think I’ll buy the Celestial Pack first!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
