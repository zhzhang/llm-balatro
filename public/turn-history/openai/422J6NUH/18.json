{"reasoning":"**Calculating hand strategy**\n\nI’m currently in Big Blind with 1200 chips needed and have 4 hands with 3 discards left. My current hand consists of 8 cards, including several diamonds, so I could aim for a flush or look for an immediate scoring hand. With the Greedy Joker, each diamond gives a multiplier, while the Crafty Joker grants chips if I complete the flush. I need to evaluate which cards to discard to maximize my chances of drawing a diamond. The math shows about a 48% chance of pulling at least one diamond by discarding some non-diamonds.\n**Strategizing for flush**\n\nTo achieve a flush, I need 5 diamonds, but currently, I only have 4: K♦, 9♦, 4♦, and 2♦. Discarding three non-diamonds, like 7♠, 9♥, and 6♥, could give me a chance to draw a diamond while keeping 3♥ steel for a potential multiplier later. If I draw a diamond, I'll complete the flush. Plus, if I keep the steel, it boosts my multiplier to 1.5. I might also have a chance to play a diamond pair with the 9♦ and 9♥!\n**Evaluating flush potential**\n\nI realized I have 9♥ in my hand, and if I discard it, I lose a pair of nines, which gives me some base chips. However, focusing on the flush seems more beneficial, especially since I'm in a big blind for 1200 chips across multiple hands. \n\nLet's calculate the flush score: Using K♦, 9♦, 4♦, 2♦, and one unknown diamond, I estimate the total chips to be quite high, around 4189.5 chips with multipliers included. Even without the steel, I still exceed 1200 chips, so going for the flush looks like the best strategy.\n**Maximizing flush chances**\n\nIt looks like going for a flush in this hand is likely to win against the blind. To maximize my chances of drawing a diamond, I should discard the non-diamond cards, specifically positions 1, 2, and 3, which are 7♠, 9♥, and 6♥, while keeping the steel card. I can still discard up to 5 cards, but keeping the steel seems smart for now. So, I’ll proceed with the action to discard those three cards and get ready for my next draw!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3]"}
