{"reasoning":"**Evaluating poker strategy**\n\nI’m working with a hand that includes two duplicates of 7♦, and I really want to aim for a flush in diamonds. To maximize my chips, I'd need to consider all the multipliers like Crafty for +80 chips, Droll for +10, and the Greedy multiplier for each diamond. Holding the steel card could be crucial since it adds a ×1.5 multiplier, which might push my total above 20,000 chips if I can achieve that flush with a few even-ranked cards.\n**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI want to enhance two selected cards with Empress to increase my multipliers, ideally focusing on 4♦ and K♦, or possibly one of the 7♦ or 3♦ cards. These enhancements could add +4 multipliers to each scored card. I'm aiming for a flush with K♦, 7♦, 7♦, 4♦, and 3♦. I'll keep Q♥, 3♥ steel, and 6♣ in my hand too, since 6♣ creates a Planet card if it's held. This could be crucial for the final hand of the round!\n**Clarifying card effects**\n\nSo, if I hold 6♣ while playing my flush, it could create a Planet card for the Flush, but only if there's room in consumables. Right now, Empress is taking up a slot, but I can still hold two, so it might work. However, it seems I shouldn’t play 6♣ anyway. I also need to think about the order of jokers since Greedy and Even Steven trigger when scored. Crafty seems to be independent, possibly triggering later. I need to confirm how these interactions play out!\n**Understanding jokers and multipliers**\n\nI’m trying to figure out how Droll and Gros Michel work with the multipliers. Droll seems to activate independently after I play a flush, and it can give a +10 multiplier with a polychrome edition that adds another ×1.5. The order of multipliers could matter — I want additive multipliers applied first, then apply any ×1.5 effects last. So if I have the polychrome version of Droll, I should place it at the end to maximize my total score!\n**Refining poker strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing how to maximize my multipliers using Gro Michel, Droll, and Crafty. I need to ensure the order of jokers matters; since I plan to hold Empress to enhance two diamonds—likely 4♦ and K♦—I’m figuring out how those will contribute to my score. The base chips currently give me 161, then I’ll add in the enhancements. I realize I need to strategize to possibly exceed 20,000 chips, which might mean adjusting what I hold and play for the best outcome!\n**Optimizing card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking through how to maximize my multipliers by having more even diamonds. Since we are allowed four hands and two discards, I’m considering which non-diamonds to discard. Discarding 3♥, Q♥, and 6♣ will allow for better diamond draws. I need to improve my chances of drawing at least three even diamonds. The current odds aren't great, about 21% for drawing three out of five cards. But with two tries, I hope to reach 20,000 chips across multiple hands!\n**Planning a card strategy**\n\nI'm considering how to maximize my flush for 20,000 chips. It's probably best to keep my diamonds and only discard non-diamonds—possibly Q♥ and 6♣. With five diamonds already, I'm looking at drawing more even diamonds to trigger bonuses. The probability of drawing at least one diamond with four draws is roughly 82%, which is promising.\n\nFrom previous hands, I know I can accumulate chips across multiple hands, so I don't need to hit the target in one go. I can just play it a bit safer for now!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,4,7]"}
