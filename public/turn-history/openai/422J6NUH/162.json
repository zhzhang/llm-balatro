{"reasoning":"**Considering consumables in gameplay**\n\nI realize consumables might be usable during a round, as the guide suggests one-time use without phase restrictions. So, it seems acceptable to use them while I have a hand and targets. However, there's confusion about target cards only available during the round. With only $1, buying anything isn’t possible unless I sell cards like the Chariot or Hanged Man, but I’d still be short for the Scholar. The best move seems to be leaving the shop and rearranging my jokers for better scoring.\n**Analyzing flush strategy and jokers**\n\nI'm thinking about the flush strategy with Droll providing a +10 bonus and a 1.5x multiplier for flushes. The Hanging Chad can retrigger the first played card two times. So, I need to calculate my net hand size, which I believe is base 8. Juggler adds 1, and Stuntman subtracts 2, resulting in a net of 7. Order matters when scoring jokers, where Droll appears to function independently. The Hanging Chad is a retriggering joker, stepping in during scoring phases. I need to confirm how these interactions work during the scoring process!\n**Understanding joker interactions**\n\nI’m considering how order impacts scoring with independent jokers. Droll adds multipliers, and Stuntman contributes chips, so both are independent. During step 5, Stuntman’s chips affect the total value before applying multipliers. If Stuntman adds 250 chips, and Droll modifies the multiplier, it may not matter how I order them since they act on different aspects. However, Hanging Chad, as a retrigger, should be played early to ensure it counts. I’m debating whether to sell Hanged Man and Chariot since they might be valuable later on, but if they're useless due to restrictions, maybe it's worth it.\n**Deciding on card retention**\n\nI see that keeping the Hanged Man and Chariot could improve my deck since the Hanged Man destroys two cards and the Chariot creates steel. However, if I can't use them now because I'm in the shop and have no hand, I might want to save them for later in the round when I do have a hand. So, I think it's a better strategy to keep them for now. Next, I'll proceed with round_select to continue.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
