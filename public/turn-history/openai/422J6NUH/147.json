{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m in a situation where I have $2 but can’t buy anything yet. I could consider selling a joker to afford either Luchador or Ice Cream, but I’m really focused on my flush build, making Uranus irrelevant. Luchador costs $5 and might help against the boss. Selling a joker means gaining its sell value, not the cost. Selling a Stuntman for $3 could give me exactly $5 for Luchador, but I'd lose those extra chips. Plus, I’m unsure if Luchador will actually be useful against the boss.\n**Assessing the swap decision**\n\nI'm trying to decide if swapping is worth it considering the ante 7 and ante 8 bosses left. Some of these bosses can end the game, like The Wall, which doubles requirements. Luchador offers some insurance, but if I give up Stuntman, it might reduce my score. Stuntman provides a solid +250 chips, which multiplies my overall score, making it significant. Losing Stuntman could hurt. I could also sell Juggler and Even Steven to buy Luchador without losing Stuntman, but I'd lose some synergy. Alternatively, selling Juggler and Hanging Chad could be an option too.\n**Deciding on sacrifices**\n\nI see that I have $2 and need $3 more to reach $5. Selling Juggler for $2 boosts my total to $4, but I still fall short. I could sell any $2 card to make $6, which would let me buy Luchador while only giving up two jokers. I need to consider which card to sacrifice with the least impact. Juggler is crucial for hand size, while Hanging Chad is significant for retriggering scored cards. Even Steven helps with multipliers for even ranks. I think keeping Stuntman and Droll is essential and will have to decide between the other three carefully.\n**Weighing card decisions**\n\nI realize that steel is in my hand but not played, and I can order cards by their indices when playing. Hanging Chad gives me 2 additional triggers for a total of 3. This is great for enhancing the first scored card if it’s a multiplier or bonus. Juggler increases hand size, currently at 7 with Stuntman’s -2 penalty. Losing Juggler to go down to 6 might hurt my flush chances. Even Steven adds +4 multiplier per even card when scored. However, it seems I can’t afford Luchador without making sacrifices. Maybe selling Even Steven plus something else could work, but I need to rethink the plan.\n**Choosing to save money**\n\nI'm considering saving my money for now instead of spending it. Since I’ll earn more after each blind, I might prefer to keep all my jokers and go into the next round with $2. I can buy Luchador later, and since it’s ante 7 in round 11, it may help but comes at a cost. Keeping my current strong setup seems wiser than trading for something uncertain. So, I’ll move to round selection. Oh, and I used Star to convert some to diamonds, which was a good move!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
