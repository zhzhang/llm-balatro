{"reasoning":"**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm thinking about how scoring works in Balatro. When scoring each card, chips are added to the total, and the multiplier (mult) is also added to a running total. The final chips are determined by multiplying the total chips by the total mult, which means the order of adding chips and mult doesn't really matter. However, there are nuances with glass cards and xmult triggers during scoring. I’m trying to figure out the best strategy for retriggering cards to maximize chips or mult.\n**Evaluating scoring strategy in Balatro**\n\nI'm considering how scoring works, particularly if the base multiplier (mult) is halved to 6. If we go for a flush, I wonder if we’ll get many even cards. For maximum scoring, I'd think about starting with an even face card, like a 10 or 8. However, I can't use both Scary Face and Even Steven since they need different card types. Choosing the first card could be crucial—do I want extra chips or mult? It’s a tough decision!\n**Planning card play for scoring**\n\nI’m thinking about the best order for the cards to maximize scoring. Ideally, I want the first scored card to be an even rank with a high chip value. A 10 would be perfect because it’s even and brings in good chips. Each scoring event adds chips, and retriggering could boost that even more. Comparing strategies, using a King gives extra chips, but I miss out on the mult. Overall, it looks like the multiplier is more beneficial, so I’ll aim to play flushes with an even card first.\n**Considering joker placement and scoring**\n\nWhen using multiple retrigger jokers, the order doesn’t really matter, so the next action will just be to play the round. However, in Blind select mode, I could think about rearranging the jokers to prioritize the card-scoring ones. Now, let’s see how adjustments affect things with the boss reducing base chips and mult. For a flush, the calculations show substantial potential, and the multiplier could reach impressive numbers along with total chips. Overall, this could lead to significant scoring!\n**Planning for maximum score**\n\nI’m thinking about how many hands I might need to reach 40k—probably 4 hands if I want an average of 10k each, which seems doable. If I only get 3 hands, I’ll need about 13k each, and that could get tricky unless I have great draws. To optimize, I should aim for a flush in every hand and use discards strategically. The Juggler gives me a hand size of 9, so that's manageable. I should go ahead with play_round and format the output as an action!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
