{"reasoning":"**Analyzing a flush strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to play the 6♥ or discard clubs to draw another heart and create a flush without using 6♥. To achieve a flush, I need five cards of the same suit. I could play 5 hearts, including 6♥, but if I want to keep 6♥ unplayed, I'll need 5 other hearts in hand. Currently, I've got 4 other hearts, so I might try to draw one more. However, my hand size allows only for 7 cards, making it tricky.\n**Calculating heart draws**\n\nI need to draw 2 more hearts by discarding both clubs, which would give me a hand of A, J, 8, 6, 2, plus two new hearts — totaling 6 hearts. Then I can play 5 hearts without using the 6♥. This is great because the steel card multiplies my score by 1.5 while held in hand. I’ll have two discards left to draw, and I need to consider the probability of drawing hearts — about 25.6% for each draw, leading to a roughly 6.6% chance for both. Since I need 6 hearts total, I need both draws to be hearts!\n**Clarifying heart counts**\n\nI’m analyzing my hand: I’ll have A, J, 8, 6, 2, plus a new heart and possibly another non-heart card, which totals 6 cards. Currently, I have five hearts, including the 6♥. If I draw one heart and one non-heart, that gives me 6 hearts total. To play five hearts excluding the 6♥, I need at least 5 others besides the 6♥. So, I just need one heart from my two draws for a 44.6% chance. However, if I draw zero hearts, I’ll still only have 5 hearts and would need to play the 6♥ to complete the flush.\n**Calculating flush scores**\n\nI think the best strategy is to discard my 6 and 7 to try to draw at least one heart. I have two discards left, so I could choose the best flush play. Alternatively, I could just play my heart flush now with A♥, J♥, 8♥, 6♥, and 2♥, which might score high enough to win in one hand.\n\nLet's estimate: my base score is 95, and the flush gives me 37 from the ranks of the cards. So, that’s a total of 132 chips, plus 250 from Stuntman for a total of 382 chips. The multiplier here is 12.\n**Optimizing scores with Even Steven and Droll**\n\nI’m applying Even Steven because my even cards (8, 6, 2) give me +4 each during scoring, raising my multiplier to 24. If I include the Droll Joker, which offers a +10 multiplier when a flush is present, I could bump that to 34. The Droll's polychrome edition also adds a 1.5 multiplier, making it 51.\n\nI’ll start with 8♥ to benefit from the Even Steven bonus, scoring chips three times due to retriggers, which adds extra value. My current score is 25,074, but I might aim for higher by keeping the steel card 6♥ in hand and discarding clubs for another heart to maximize multipliers. This could push my score significantly closer to the goal!\n**Deciding on discards and rearrangements**\n\nI’m calculating my chips: base is 95, adding up to around 40 from my cards, resulting in about 135 total. With the Hanging Chad bonus, plus the Stuntman, I think I can reach 401. For multipliers, starting at 12, I’ll need to account for Even Steven from the even hearts played. \n\nSince I want to maximize my scoring, I’ll discard the clubs from positions 6 and 7 to improve my hand, then rearrange my cards to place 8♥ first. So, I’ll take action to discard those positions now!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [6,7]"}
