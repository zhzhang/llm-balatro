{"reasoning":"**Figuring out game strategy**\n\nI’m analyzing the interest cap and thinking about how much I can potentially make. If I have $40, I might cap interest at $5, but I’m not entirely sure based on the game rules. Since I already have $40, I can spend $15 and still maximize my interest. Maybe I’ll buy a Flash Card for free, then think about getting a Magic Trick for $10. That leaves me with $30, which is still pretty good!\n**Weighing options for strategy**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy Mega for two or if my current flushes are sufficient, especially at higher antes. I might want to find Jupiter for leveling up my flush but it's not available. If I reroll the shop, I could search for Jupiter or flush jokers. Rerolls cost $5 each, and with my $40, I could do two rerolls for a +4 multiplier and still have $30 left. I should also keep track of the maximum jokers!\n**Deciding on Flash Card purchase**\n\nThe Flash Card at +0 doesn’t seem useful right now, and I’d need rerolls to improve it. However, if I buy it now and opt not to reroll, I could still gain some value later. I’m worried that it might block new jokers, but I can sell it later if needed, since it’s free. Usually, free items can sell for around $3. So I think I’ll go ahead and buy the Flash Card first.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
