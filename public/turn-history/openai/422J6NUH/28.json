{"reasoning":"**Selecting card strategy**\n\nI’m considering how playing more flushes can strengthen our position. With the 8 Ball, there’s a 1 in 4 chance of creating Tarot when scored, but we’re not focusing on 8s right now. I also have to think about room for consumables, which is currently 0 out of 2. Supernova seems to offer more consistent scaling with our flush-based strategy, so I'll choose that instead. Now, I need to issue the command to select it.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
