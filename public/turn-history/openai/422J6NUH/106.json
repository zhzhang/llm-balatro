{"reasoning":"**Weighing options in poker**\n\nI'm considering whether to skip the small blind, which means losing a $3 reward but moving to the big blind selection. If I skip small, I won't be able to shop afterward, but the $19 gain now could help with future purchases. Since I have $4, boosting to $23 is significant. Although skipping might affect my ability to earn interest, it seems best to continue to the big blind selection, even if it's tougher. Our flush hands previously scored well, but the ante likely complicates scoring.\n**Analyzing poker strategy**\n\nOkay, so for the last big blind ante at 5, I have 19,355 for a flush. The flush currently ranges from 13-19k, and with a new ante requirement of 6, hitting 20k might mean needing two hands. The big requirement is 30k, likely needing two hands too. The boss at 40k is tough; it halves my base chips, reducing my overall score. While the scoring from jokers remains, I need a solid plan. I’m considering whether skipping small and big blinds is worth it, especially since the big skip offers a free Mega Arcana pack.\n**Thinking through big blind strategy**\n\nIf I decide to skip the big blind, I won't get to shop before facing the boss, which could be risky since the boss effect halves my base score. While I might still beat the boss with a flush, I might need some enhancements. A free Mega Arcana pack is tempting, but I can only get it if I skip the big blind. However, if I do skip, I'll lose a $4 reward and miss out on shop opportunities and potential earnings from remaining hands. So, I need to weigh these options carefully!\n**Deciding on boss strategy**\n\nI think skipping the small blind might still be a good idea. I really want to ensure I can beat the boss with my current build. By playing the big blind, I get a chance to shop for potential upgrades beforehand. If I skip the small blind, I’ll have $23 after that, plus the big blind reward of $4 and leftover hands. This strategy seems solid, so I’ll go ahead and skip the small blind for now and decide about the big blind later!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
