{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m currently in a shop with $4 and no consumables. I have options between two cards: the Neptune planet, which upgrades my straight flush, and the Tower tarot. The flush strategy is my main focus, so the Neptune isn’t useful. Since buying a card might not yield much, I’m wondering if it’s better to save the money instead. I’ll skip the purchases and just focus on rearranging my jokers for priority. I need to ensure the right triggers for scoring.\n**Analyzing joker multipliers**\n\nI’m thinking about how Droll offers a +10 multiplier if I have a flush, plus an additional x1.5 multiplier from the polychrome edition. I want to clarify—does Droll get the x1.5 from polychrome? In Balatro, it’s clear the joker's effect gains that x1.5 independently. The order of independent jokers matters since they trigger left-to-right. I need to consider how to place Even Steven before Scary Face to optimize their effects when scoring cards.\n**Clarifying chip and multiplier interactions**\n\nI’m trying to figure out how the order of additions affects chips and multipliers. It seems that additive chips don’t depend on the sequence, while the multipliers affect the final score differently since the multiplication occurs at the end. If a joker adds chips during scoring, it could change how total chips are calculated, but they still get multiplied by the final multiplier. So, when mult increases earlier, it won’t impact chip additions later, but later chip additions will still multiply by whatever the final mult is.\n**Understanding multiplier interactions**\n\nI’m realizing that the counters update in such a way that my final score is calculated as chips multiplied by the multiplier. Since the final multiplication uses the final values, the order of additive chips and multipliers doesn’t affect the end result, except when we're talking about multiplicative multipliers. The order does matter there since addition and multiplication aren’t commutative. Droll’s x1.5 multiplier might apply after scoring. Plus, if Droll has an independent +10 multiplier, that could also come into play.\n**Evaluating Droll's multipliers and strategies**\n\nI’m diving into Droll’s mechanics: the +10 multiplier from flush is independent, applying at step 5, while the x1.5 from the polychrome edition also triggers simultaneously. The order of independent jokers matters; I want Droll’s effects to maximize scoring. The Hanging Chad retriggers face cards for added chips, which is significant, while Even Steven adds multipliers for even ranks. Choosing the first card is key—balancing between face cards for chips or even cards for multipliers could create the best combination. I’m also considering whether securing a straight flush upgrade is worthwhile if the boss debuffs flushes.\n**Weighing options for the upcoming boss**\n\nI’m considering our situation: having a straight flush as a backup seems wise, especially if the boss, The Arm, reduces hand levels. The Neptune card could level up my straight flush, but it costs $3. We need to decide if it’s worth spending our limited cash. I need to maintain funds for future shops and potential rerolls, which might give me better options later. Since the boss round is approaching and may be tough, I’m leaning towards saving my money instead of overspending now.\n**Deciding on strategy before the boss**\n\nThe Arm boss could reduce flush levels, which makes me consider the value of the Neptune card. It might boost a straight flush to level 4, but hitting that flush could be tough, especially since we're focused on a flush build. I also debate whether to buy Neptune and hold it for later or use it now. However, it seems wiser to save cash for the next shop, especially since I can't reroll right now. So, I’ll opt for round_select instead of making any purchases.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
