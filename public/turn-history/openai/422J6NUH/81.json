{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nIn Balatro, debuffed cards don't score chips or trigger when-scored effects, so I think they shouldn't count as \"when scored\" for Even Steven. However, I’m not totally sure about that. It might be safer to avoid clubs in scoring flushes. My best action is to play big blind to secure the shop and reward. With my build, I think I can reach 16,500 with one or two flushes like I did earlier in ante 4. So, I should play a round instead of passing.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
