{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategies**\n\nI'm considering that if we don't use discards, Banner could provide a significant chip boost, around 2700 more. That sounds great, but some bosses might limit discards to 0 or 1, which leaves me unsure about the next moves. Most rounds stay consistent, though. I’m thinking about swapping Wee Joker for Banner since it’s more immediate. I also have to weigh options like Red Card and Overstock, but I need to maintain interest with my money.\n**Calculating card strategy**\n\nI'm in ante 5, so I need power rather than money. I want to keep at least $10 for 2 interest, which could work. To buy Banner, I'd need to sell a joker. Selling Wee for $4 and then buying Banner for $5 leaves me at a net of -1. If I also buy Overstock for $10, that totals 11 spent from 21, leaving me with 10. I need to confirm the card positions for Banner and make sure I have a slot after selling the joker.\n**Weighing card options**\n\nI’m considering keeping Wee and selling Even Steven, but Even Steven has some synergy with flushes and even ranks. The plus 4 per even card scored in a flush gives a +10 multiplier, which isn’t huge, but it’s decent. Wee is currently at 0, but could scale well later with Magic Trick. Although, Banner might outperform without any setup due to its chip-boosting abilities. I think having both Banner and Even Steven could be great, but I’d need to drop either Wee or Gros Michel.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI see that Droll is essential, and Crafty is key. Right now, I have slots for Even Steven, Wee, and Gros. I think I'll keep Gros until it breaks, but maybe it makes sense to drop Even. A solid option could be to replace Wee with Banner while keeping Even Steven and Gros. If Gros eventually breaks, I can add a scaling multiplier. I’ll implement this by first selling the Wee Joker, followed by buying Banner in future actions.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
