{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop purchases**\n\nI’m at the shop after buying a Banner, and I still have a Red Card for $5 and an Overstock voucher for $10. My current balance is $20. Considering my strong setup, I need to decide what to buy. The Overstock voucher is appealing because it increases shop slots without taking a joker slot, and I'll still have $10 left after purchasing it. The Red Card seems less attractive since it relies on boosters, which I don't have now. So, I'll opt for the Overstock voucher!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
