{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card mechanics**\n\nI'm considering the mechanics involved in using cards from the shop or during gameplay. We can’t directly make a flush; we need to think about which cards in our \"Hand\" are currently in our deck. In the shop view, the \"Hand\" shows the top eight cards, which represents our current hand before the next play.\n\nOkay, I could use the Death card to copy a strong card, like the Bonus Ace of Diamonds. However, Death requires selecting two cards. Choosing a weaker card on the left allows me to copy a stronger card on the right. This could help create another Bonus Ace or a 9 Gold card, which has its own strategic advantages.\n**Exploring card strategies**\n\nI’m weighing the benefits of using the Bonus Ace since it could yield huge chips. Alternatively, I could create more 2s to scale up the Wee Joker, but we currently don’t have any 2s showing. The Death card might help create 2s, but I’m not sure about that either.\n\nThe Hanged Man can thin the deck to improve my chances of a flush by destroying off-suit ranks, though I can only remove two cards now, which feels uncertain. Justice can double my Glass card multiplier when scored, but it carries the risk of destruction. This might be wise for a high-value card in a flush, like an Ace.\n\nBut the Glass card only activates if it’s part of the five cards in a scored flush. Transforming an Ace into Glass could significantly boost my multiplier, but there’s the risk of losing it. The Chariot steel card triggers when held, allowing me to potentially hold a steel Ace or another card to multiply my score by 1.5 each hand. Since my multiplier is already high from the jokers, any extra multiplicative boost would be beneficial!\n**Choosing card strategies**\n\nThe Steel card can be any rank, which is great since I can choose a card I won't play, like the 3 of Spades or the 6 of Hearts. However, if I aim for a flush in Spades, I might end up playing a Spade card. It seems smarter to pick an off-suit card, like the 6 of Hearts, especially since I'm likely targeting a Clubs or Spades flush. \n\nNow, is it better to focus on the Chariot or Death card? Death can duplicate a Bonus Ace, increasing the chip base, but maybe it’s less powerful than the Steel multiplier. Currently, I'm already seeing a high multiplier, and I need chips too! My setup has chips from the flush base, plus extra from ranks, Crafty, and an additional 80. I really need to scale for the later antes, which range from 6 to 8. The Steel card multiplies my score by 1.5 every hand if I hold it, and if I can hold multiple Steel cards, that could really boost my score.\n**Choosing card options**\n\nI’m considering the best option for my strategy. Temperance offers $14, which seems appealing, but I already have $21. The interest is $1 per $5 at the end of the round, meaning having more money would help in future buys, yet I’m already at $21. If I take the $14, I’d reach $35, but sacrificing a permanent upgrade doesn’t feel right.\n\nI think choosing the Chariot is better since it gives me a Steel card for the multiplier. I’ll select a card to keep in hand, like the 6 of Hearts, and use the Chariot on it at position 3. It could also work on the 5 of Clubs, but the Steel card triggers while it stays in hand, which I can manage by not playing it during a flush. Playing a 5-card flush allows me to easily leave the Steel out, especially since there are no bosses requiring me to play 5 cards. So, I’ll go with the Chariot targeting the 6 of Hearts!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,3]"}
