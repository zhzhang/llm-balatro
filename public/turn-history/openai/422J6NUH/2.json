{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card choices**\n\nI'm thinking the charm tag might give a free Mega Arcana Pack right away, though we aren't in the shop right now. Maybe it gives a pack immediately when skipping blind? Anyway, we have a current hand of 8 cards and need to choose tarot cards and targets carefully. For early ante, I should consider cards like Hierophant for a bonus, Tower for stone, or Chariot for steel. Chips are essential since no jokers are in play, so I'll prioritize my selections.\n**Considering strategy for the boss fight**\n\nIn the early game, I prefer to have bonuses on high cards and steel on cards I want to hold for scaling. Without jokers in play, steel provides a x1.5 multiplier, which is great if I can leave it unplayed. \n\nIt looks like the boss might be called \"The Pillar.\" Since we skipped both blinds and haven't played any cards yet, there are no debuffs engaged for the boss fight. So, these tarot cards I'm selecting can be utilized immediately to help score against the boss!\n**Clarifying tarot card selection**\n\nIt seems that selecting from the tarot pack will add consumables to my inventory. Arcana packs allow me to choose a tarot card to take as a consumable. But here, I must apply the tarot cards to my current hand after selection. \n\nIn Balatro, when I pick a tarot from a pack, I can use it or store it immediately. However, this interface indicates that selecting a tarot card directly applies it to the chosen cards in hand right away when I open the pack.\n**Selecting tarot cards for enhancement**\n\nIt looks like I'm meant to choose from the tarot pack during this round, where I pick a card and then select targets from my current hand. This will have an immediate effect on those hand cards, and afterward, it may influence my permanent deck. Tarots usually enhance cards in hand. \n\nWith the Hierophant card, I can boost two selected cards into Bonus cards, each gaining +30 chips. I should choose high-rank cards like the Ace of Diamonds and the 10 of Clubs to maximize scoring potential. This will add the bonus chips while keeping their ranks intact. So, Ace and 10 are my picks!\n**Selecting tarot cards for enhancements**\n\nThe Chariot card provides a x1.5 multiplier for a low-value card I keep in hand, which is useful if I don't play it. I'll choose the 3 of Hearts for that. The Tower card gives +50 chips but doesn’t contribute to hand formation since it has no rank or suit. \n\nFor the Mega pack, I'm planning to choose two tarots. The best combination seems to be Hierophant for bonus cards and Chariot for the multiplier. So, I’ll select Hierophant on the Ace and 10, then Chariot on the 3. I'll issue the first selection for the Hierophant now!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,7,4]"}
