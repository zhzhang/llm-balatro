{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI need to decide whether to play or skip the big blind of 30k for a charm tag that gives a Mega Arcana pack. I currently have $23. If I play the big blind, I'll go around and then head to the shop, earning a $4 reward plus anything left. But if I skip, I can get the Mega Arcana pack immediately. Skipping triggers the charm tag but I won't have a shop before facing the boss.\n**Analyzing post-boss strategy**\n\nAfter facing the boss, if I win, I'll have a chance to shop. The charm tag guarantees a Mega Arcana pack during that shopping moment. However, skipping now would delay upgrades until after the boss fight, which could be risky since the boss halves my base chips and multipliers. I need to evaluate if my current build can defeat the boss with a halved base of 40k. I've consistently scored between 10k to 19k in earlier rounds.\n**Calculating flush bonuses**\n\nWhen I hit a flush, all five cards contribute chips, and the multi bonuses from even Steven activate for each even card. If I use the hanging chad, it retriggers the first scored card twice, which means it gets both its chips and effects three times. I want my first card to be even for maximum benefit. Crafty adds +80 chips for a flush, while Droll contributes a +10 multiplier and a x1.5 multiplier, plus the polychrome edition adds its own x1.5 multiplier. If the boss halves my base chips and multipliers, it’ll impact my flush scoring significantly.\n**Estimating flush multipliers**\n\nIf even cards contribute, I might see a multiplier bonus between +8 to +16, which could bring my total to something like 6 + 10 + 12 = 28, then multiplied by x1.5 twice for a total of 63. But if the base multiplier is halved to 3, that drops my total to around 25, which is still decent. Though base chips halve from 50 to 25, contributions from played cards like Crafty’s +80 chips remain unaffected, potentially resulting in a modest loss in scoring. I think my flushes can still reach 8k to 15k, but I need to figure out how many hands I have to play to hit 40k.\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI need to reach 40k; if each flush is around 15k, getting three flushes might be achievable with four hands, but it could be risky with a low draw. Playing the big blind seems safer because I can shop afterward, potentially getting tarot cards to enhance my deck before facing the boss. However, skipping the big blind for a Mega Arcana pack might provide a strong tarot, but that won’t help immediately against the boss. I’m leaning toward playing the big blind to secure immediate upgrades for the fight.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
