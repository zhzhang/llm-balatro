{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker options**\n\nI see that we currently have five jokers, and I’m considering selling one to buy a Luchador. This could be significant since it disables boss blindness, especially in tough situations. But it costs $5, which means we'd need to sell one current joker. I wonder if it's worth it. Right now, I have a couple of valuable jokers: Even Steven, which boosts multipliers on even cards, and Droll Joker polychrome, which greatly enhances our flush multipliers.\n**Assessing joker decisions**\n\nI need to decide which jokers to keep. First, Hanging Chad is great for synergy with multiplier cards, so I'm keeping that. The Juggler adds a +1 hand size, which is also helpful because Stuntman reduces hand size, so I'll likely hold onto it. But there's Stuntman, which gives +250 chips but decreases hand size. I can't easily replace this. Maybe I could sell Even Steven? But let’s analyze: it contributes +4 for each even rank scored, and I wonder if that’s worth dropping.\n**Understanding joker mechanics**\n\nI realize that Even Steven triggers for every even card scored, and retriggers are a big deal since they also activate Even Steven's bonuses. With the 4d multiplier card retriggered multiple times by Hanging Chad, I see how it provides substantial multipliers—totaling +24 across three triggers! That makes Even Steven quite strong, so I shouldn't sell it. As for the Juggler, while hand size is important for finding flushes, we often have a hand size of seven. This might come from how cards are dealt, since the default is eight.\n**Clarifying hand size and bosses**\n\nI'm realizing that in Balatro, the default hand size is indeed 8 cards. With the Juggler, it goes up to 9, and Stuntman then drops it to 7, which all fits together perfectly. While the Juggler isn't essential, it’s definitely helpful. I have $6, which could let me buy Luchador by selling Juggler, but that would reduce my hand size to 6. On the flip side, Luchador could save me from boss challenges. I remember we’re at ante 7 now, with two bosses left to face!\n**Deciding on boosts and investments**\n\nI’m weighing my options. Luchador could disable a boss, but I could also invest in planet Uranus to enhance Two Pair, although we typically play flush. Arcana packs could improve my deck with tarot, but they cost $4, which I can afford. The Mega Celestial Pack is out of my budget. Ice Cream would be an inferior choice to Stuntman. After considering everything, it seems purchasing the Arcana pack is the best decision. I'll command buy_booster 2 and select from the tarots immediately.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
