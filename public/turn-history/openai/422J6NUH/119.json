{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card triggers**\n\nDroll gives a +10 multiplier and x1.5 for flush, while Crafty offers +80 chips with a flush. I think I'd want to keep both. Wrathful might outscale Crafty if five spades are involved, as each spade gives +3, leading to a potential +15 multiplier. Also, I'm considering if Chad’s retriggering works in conjunction with Wrathful’s scoring for spades. The mechanics suggest significant potential for multipliers, but only for a spade flush, which might not be valuable otherwise.\n**Analyzing card purchase options**\n\nI see that Magic Trick allows buying playing cards, but I haven't seen any available in the shop. It looks like suit control might be limited. The Blank voucher could potentially unlock Antimatter later and give an extra Joker slot if we buy multiple, but I need to confirm that the Blank is necessary for Antimatter to show up. The Celestial pack for $4 seems like a great option, especially since each Jupiter adds +2 multiplier and +15 chips, which is a solid upgrade. Overall, it seems prioritizing the Celestial pack might be the way to go!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nIf I buy the pack now, I'll still have $21 left, so I can get the Blank voucher later. Since I can only take one action, I need to choose the best option. Buying the Celestial pack seems like the way to go, especially since it could give me Jupiter immediately and help increase the flush level to 5, which would be a big boost. Let’s make it happen! I’ll go ahead with the action command: buy_booster 1.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
