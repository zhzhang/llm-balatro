{"reasoning":"**Analyzing tarot usage in Balatro**\n\nI'm thinking about how the tarot cards work in the shop. It seems like you can specify cards from your deck, but the current hand is not shown. This makes it tricky since I can't target any cards without that hand displayed. The Hanged Man card could be useful, but it requires targets, and since none appear, I might need to wait until the hand is visible before using it. It's all a bit confusing with the interface!\n**Considering tarot card mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about how tarot cards are typically used in a shop by selecting them from the deck view. We need hand positions to proceed, but that’s not currently possible. An alternative could be selling consumables for cash, but would that be truly helpful? Tarots can generally only be used in the shop, so if I can’t use them later, selling might be worth considering. Maybe there’s a hidden hand, and I can use cards without specifying targets? I'll need to figure this out before proceeding.\n**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nI'm considering how to effectively use our cards with the API's mechanics. We can have a flush with five cards while holding two. Steel cards boost our multipliers when held, and Chariot can enhance a card into steel, which sounds good! The challenge is knowing our hand to make informed choices. We might need to sell consumables before moving to the round. The Hanged Man could help improve our flush by removing non-matching cards, so I'll want to keep using these when possible, even if our hand isn’t visible!\n**Considering card strategies and actions**\n\nI'm thinking about using Chariot on a high-value diamond chip card, like the King of Diamonds. I remember that earlier, when opening a pack, the displayed hand included the King, Jack (which is steel), and 9 of Diamonds. If that was our hand, it might still be in the shop even if it’s not displayed now. This leads me to believe it may not be possible to specify. I should focus on proceeding to the next round for payouts, and perhaps arrange the jokers for optimal activation since their order can really influence the game dynamics!\n**Evaluating card options and strategies**\n\nI'm considering how the Hanging Chad retriggers the first played scoring card, engaging in step 3 for an additional two plays. The order of jokers might matter, especially for retriggering effects. Droll and Stuntman are independent and add value differently. I’m contemplating selling cards for cash, but it feels risky to let go of key jokers like Stuntman, which boosts chips significantly.\n\nIn terms of boosting my deck, keeping consumables for improvements might make more sense than immediate cash. Using Hanged Man to remove non-diamond cards could also help enhance my hand! I'm leaning towards keeping my cards for potential future value while strategically using my actions to boost scoring.\n**Deciding on card destruction**\n\nI'm considering using the Hanged Man to permanently destroy off-suit cards. Based on my earlier hand, I’d target the 7 of Spades and the 5 of Spades, which would reduce my deck size and increase the ratio of diamonds, enhancing my chances for a flush. Although the foil 2 of Clubs could be useful, focusing on a reliable flush seems more beneficial, especially for the upcoming ante8 boss battle. \n\nSo, I'll target and destroy the 7♠ and 5♠. It feels like the right move! I’ll proceed with that action while keeping the Chariot for later.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,1,2]"}
