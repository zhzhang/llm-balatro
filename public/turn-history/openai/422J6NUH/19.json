{"reasoning":"**Calculating game mechanics**\n\nI’m considering the mechanics of a game with 5 diamonds, each providing a +3 bonus, totaling +15. There’s also a Joker that gives +80 chips if a hand contains a flush, which seems to be independent too. It looks like I should add this to my chips before multiplying for the final score: 101 + 80 equals 181. After applying the multiplier from held cards, the final calculation yields over 5100 chips. So, I’ll play cards 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 while keeping Steel in hand too!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
