{"reasoning":"**Considering game purchases**\n\nI'm in the shop and notice we've already sold Wee. Now, we need to buy the Banner, which costs 5. That adds chips based on our remaining discards. Usually, we have 3 at the start, and if we don't discard, we get 90 chips added before multiplication—pretty great. Then I see we have 25 money, and Overstock is tempting at 10 because it increases our shop slots. Should we buy both? If we leave 10, we get 2 interest at the end of the round. So, it looks pretty good!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI think the best move is to buy the Banner first and maybe consider the Voucher later. For now, we should focus on the immediate action, which is to buy the Banner that costs 5, as it won’t impact our interest too much. So, I'll go ahead and execute this action. I need to remember to output the JSON for the action to buy the card at position [1], without specifying a hand type. Let's do this!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
