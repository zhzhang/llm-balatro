{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card gameplay strategy**\n\nWith a hand size of 7, if I hold 1 or 2 steel cards, it limits my playable cards to 5 or 6. We need exactly 5 cards for a flush, so holding 2 steel cards allows for that. However, I should consider the need to draw 5 cards of the same suit. If the deck is suit-focused, that could work, but holding steel may reduce flush chances. Alternatively, I might still score with non-flush hands due to Droll, although Droll only applies to flush. The High Priestess provides up to 2 random planets, improving hand type levels without reducing size. Levelling a flush using a planet card, like Jupiter, could be significant. Yet, the randomness (1/12 chance for a flush planet) means I might only expect 0.166 flush planets from each one drawn.\n**Calculating flush probabilities**\n\nWith two planets, I calculate the chance of having at least one flush as 1 - (11/12)^2, which comes out to about 16%. That feels pretty low. However, other planets could help with different combinations like a straight flush, but that seems unlikely. Relying on flushes is still the main strategy. Taking the Chariot to add steel might be a better option since it multiplies conditions effectively. Steel is powerful, and combining it with Droll +1.5 and other multipliers could really boost our chances. Since the deck appears to have many spades, I might be able to keep the steel card off-suit while still drawing a flush with the remaining cards. Alternatively, making the steel card of the same suit could help with flush plays too.\n**Choosing card enhancements**\n\nI realize that the steel enhancement triggers while the card is still in hand, but playing the card would lose that effect. So, ideally, I should hold onto a card I don't want to play right away, regardless of its suit. Since I’m aiming for a high scoring target likely between 7-8 in ante, a multiplicative multiplier is a better choice than smaller chips. The Chariot seems to be the best option. I’ll need to decide which card to enhance to steel. Out of my current hand, I notice the 2 of diamonds would be a great choice since it’s low-rank and doesn’t help with flushes, plus it could assist with Even Steven’s multiplier bonus for even ranks.\n**Deciding on card enhancements**\n\nThe 2 of diamonds is even and could provide a +4 multiplier if played in a flush. However, if I turn it to steel and keep it in hand, I lose the chance to score with it. I might want to preserve other cards like 2s, 6s, 8s, and 10s for scoring. The King of hearts has high chip value but isn’t special without Scary Face. Maybe I should choose a non-spade like the 9 of hearts. However, I might still play a heart flush, so perhaps the Jack of diamonds would work, but the 6 of clubs seems like a solid pick since I already have a steel card with the 3 of hearts.\n**Selecting steel card strategy**\n\nI think it might be better to transform a spade card since I can discard it later. However, since steel cards stay in hand, the suit doesn’t matter as much. To maintain a flush, I might prefer steel cards that don’t match the suit I'm chasing, as they’ll just occupy slots. If I want a spade flush, I need to keep the remaining cards as spades. So choosing an off-suit steel card is ideal. I see King of hearts, 9 hearts, 6 clubs, Jack diamonds, and 2 diamonds in my hand. Although I might consider holding two steel cards (the existing 3 hearts and a new one), converting the Jack of diamonds seems best since it’s off-suit. It’ll help me keep the 1.5 multiplier while still being able to discard it later if needed.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,6]"}
