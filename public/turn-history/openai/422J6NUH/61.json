{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card purchase options**\n\nI sold Supernova and now I have four jokers. In the shop, I see Even Steven and 8 Ball. Even Steven is appealing since it fits with my flush strategy, using all five cards. The average rank seems good with a probability of 38% for even ranks. \n\nFor flushes, I'm considering suit probabilities and I find that Even Steven has better expected multipliers than the alternatives like Droll or Gros Michel. It looks like Even Steven is the best buy for $4!\n**Deciding on card purchase strategy**\n\nI'm calculating the probabilities related to getting an 8 in a five-card hand, which comes to about 9.5%. Plus, I factor in a low chance of creating tarot with only around 2.4% per hand. Given these numbers, I think it's not worth pursuing that option and decide to go for Even Steven instead. I have room for more cards, so buying makes sense. After buying, I might consider rerolling for planets, but my next step will likely be to buy another card.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
