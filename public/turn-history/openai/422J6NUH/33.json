{"reasoning":"**Calculating game scores**\n\nThe base multiplier for flush level 2 is 6. I’m thinking of adding Greedy, which could be +3 times the number of diamonds in scoring, yielding between 0 and 15 points. Then I'll add Droll (+10) and Supernova (+2), creating an additive total of +12 plus Greedy. After that, multiplying everything by 1.5. For chips, the base starts at 50, plus cards chips from 5 suited cards and Crafty (+80). The previous ante 2 boss flush reached 4032, so I’m aiming to beat 4000.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
