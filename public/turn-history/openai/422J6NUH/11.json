{"reasoning":"**Planning strategy for card shop**\n\nI'm currently at the shop with $9 and no jokers. The options include The Fool, Greedy Joker, Buffoon pack, and Jumbo Celestial Pack. I need a plan for the early game to scale with jokers, and Greedy Joker would work well since I have many diamonds in my deck. \n\nBuying Greedy Joker for $5 and the Buffoon pack for $4 fits my budget perfectly. Alternatively, I could focus on the Jumbo Celestial for improving hand types, but I think Greedy Joker is the better first choice.\n**Clarifying card mechanics**\n\nI initially thought that this situation involved The Fool and The Tower, but it looks like The Tower is excluded. There might be a misunderstanding about how the game works. The Fool seems to be a consumable that would take up a slot and potentially copy cards, but since I haven't used any tarot yet, it might not provide any value.\n\nI should buy the Greedy Joker for $5 and then the Buffoon pack for $4 if it allows sequential purchases. For now, I'll choose to buy the Greedy Joker first.\n**Preparing to output action**\n\nI see that the next state will prompt me for input again. So, I need to prepare an action in JSON format to buy a card. This ensures that I'm ready for any upcoming requests efficiently. I'll make sure it's clear and straightforward since this will guide the next steps in the game. I'll focus on structuring the output correctly, so everything works smoothly when I hit send.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
