{"reasoning":"**Evaluating options for blind select**\n\nI'm considering whether to skip for the Ethereal tag and get a free Spectral Pack. On one hand, skipping means losing the $4 reward and missing out on shopping afterward. If I skip, I'll stay in blind select and face the next boss at 70k without a chance to shop. But the free Spectral pack could be powerful. Plus, I have a strong joker setup, so maybe I can beat the blind with a good draw. It's a tough choice!\n**Deciding on the best play**\n\nI'm thinking about my options here. Even Steven relies on the cards played, and I need to use five for a flush. The Hanging Chad would retrigger my first scoring card two times, which sounds great! Still, I should probably play the big blind to earn $4 and shop before facing the boss, who might be tough. Although the Ethereal tag offers a free Spectral Pack, I don't want to risk losing both shop and money. So, I’ll choose to play my round!\n**Clarifying retrigger mechanics**\n\nI’m diving into how the retrigger works. It’s based on the first played card used in scoring, and the order of jokers matters. The Hanging Chad triggers after the first card, retriggering it two more times. I'm realizing it doesn’t rely solely on order, but it does affect the outcome among the retriggering jokers, moving left to right. Droll is independent, while Even Steven scores based on played cards with even ranks for a multiplier. I’ll keep refining this understanding!\n**Understanding scoring and joker effects**\n\nI'm sorting through the mechanics of how the Hanging Chad retriggers the first card and repeats the scoring sequence with Even Steven and other enhancements. I think Droll should activate before Stuntman, since independent jokers trigger left to right. Droll adds a +10 multiplier if a flush is played, plus a x1.5 multiplier. The order matters here because we add then multiply. It looks like the base effect triggers first, followed by the edition, but I'm not completely certain about this!\n**Deciding joker order for effectiveness**\n\nI’m considering if rearranging the joker order would help. If I place Droll earlier, its +10 multiplier can apply before others. Stuntman provides chips, not a multiplier, and Even Steven is per-card, so its placement isn't crucial. However, only Droll has the x1.5 multiplier, which is always applied. Since that’s the case, the order relative to other jokers may not be as important. Overall, I think it's best to stick with the current plan and proceed with the round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
