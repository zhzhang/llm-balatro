{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card selection and tags**\n\nI think there was some confusion in the tarot pack selection. They picked \"select 2 6,\" which likely means they chose option 2 (the Chariot) and targeted card 6 (Jack of Diamonds) to turn into Steel. Now, we have two steel cards: the 3 of hearts and the Jack of Diamonds. Currently, our money is $0, and skipping creates a Top-up tag, but we’re already at max joker capacity. The Ethereal tag could provide a valuable spectral pack, but we can only get it by skipping the Big blind, not the Small.\n**Evaluating ante rounds and strategy**\n\nAlright, Round 10 indicates a small blind for ante 7, but each ante has 3 rounds. This suggests we've played 9 rounds already, so the 10th must indeed relate to ante 7. Our goal is to survive while also preparing for the finale. Previously, I reached a flush score of 23k, but now I need 35k. One big flush might get me close, but I could need two hands. Playing small is necessary, even though it means skipping the shop. Thus, I’ll play this round without rearranging the jokers.\n**Considering joker effects and order**\n\nOrder matters when it comes to the independent multipliers like Droll and Polychrome, which might both be in category 5. I think Droll gives a +10 multiplier, and then Polychrome offers an additional x1.5 to the same joker. In the game, the edition on the joker triggers after its base effect, which simplifies things a bit. However, the order of jokers plays a role in how Hanging Chad works, particularly for retriggering jokers. Since we only have one retriggering joker, I’ll move forward and just play.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
