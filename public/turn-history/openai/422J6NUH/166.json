{"reasoning":"**Clarifying hand size and strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about the base hand size in Balatro, which I recall is 8. Wait, I’m confirming if our current hand size is 7 after accounting for a Stuntman reducing it by 2 and a Juggler increasing it by 1. Yes, that makes sense! With only 7 cards, I need a plan to score big, aiming for flushes that yield a huge multiplier. Since I can discard three cards, it seems wise to get rid of non-heart cards to go for that flush.\n**Planning for a hearts flush**\n\nI'm thinking about discarding to pursue a hearts flush. I’ll keep the Q♥ and 8♥ while discarding the rest: 9♠, 6♣, 6♣, A♦, and Stone, which is allowed since I can discard up to 5 cards. This will let me draw 5 new ones, hoping for 3 more hearts. I could also consider playing a quick pair of 6's or a high chip Stone, but that won't score as much. However, the Stuntman’s bonus could provide an essential chip boost, helping even a weak hand.\n**Strategizing for scoring 70k**\n\nTo reach 70k, I might need at least two flushes, possibly with a high card. If I can score one flush for around 35k and another for 35k, that could do the trick! With 3 discards, it’s best to get rid of 5 non-target suit cards, but I need to consider how Hanging Chad interacts with the first played card. Ideally, I'd want my first card to be a high chip value like a bonus Ace or Stone to trigger extra scoring. Playing the Stone first could multiply my points, thanks to retriggering!\n**Evaluating the Stone card**\n\nI've realized that the Stone card adds +50 chips but has no suit or rank, so it can't contribute to a flush. For a flush, I need 5 suited cards, and the Stone card just doesn't fit in. It seems best used for high card plays instead. I can play a high card with the Stone as the highest, but since it has no rank, I may consider playing a card like a Queen. The Stone still scores its 50 chips if it’s part of a scoring hand, though!\n**Analyzing the Stone card and strategy**\n\nThe Stone card adds +50 chips but doesn’t contribute to forming a flush, as it has no rank or suit. If I play 5 cards including the Stone and 4 hearts, the flush won’t form since only 5 cards of the same suit count. Instead, the Stone might be better for forming a pair with other cards, like a pair of 6s. However, it seems that while cards must participate in the highest hand to score, the Stone’s special effect might allow it to always score, despite its limitations. I should keep the Stone handy for high-card plays but prioritize my flush without it. Additionally, the 6♣ has a skill that might generate a planet card for my final hand if I keep it unplayed. I might need to clear a consumable slot to maximize this strategy.\n**Strategizing with the Steel card**\n\nI’m considering using a card like Q♥ or A♦ to create a Steel card for a 1.5x multiplier, which would be beneficial for my flush builds. However, the Steel card takes up a slot and must remain in hand to activate. I can enhance the 6♣ into Steel using Chariot, and I believe the planet creation effect would still work. After using Chariot, it frees a slot for a new consumable. My immediate plan is to enhance the 6♣, keep it unplayed for now, and then discard less useful cards to chase a hearts flush, as I have a decent chance to draw more hearts. Even though I considered a diamond flush due to density, I’ll stick with hearts because I already have two and the potential to draw more.\n**Calculating flush probabilities**\n\nWith 43 cards left in the deck and 11 hearts remaining, I want to calculate the probability of drawing at least 3 hearts in 4 draws, keeping 2 hearts in hand. To get 5 hearts total, I would need to draw 3 more hearts. The probability turns out low at around 4.54%. Given my options, it might be better to discard to draw 7 cards instead. The plan is to use Chariot to enhance 6♣, hold it for its multiplier, and then selectively discard to increase my chances of assembling a flush in hearts or clubs.\n**Calculating card probabilities**\n\nIf I keep A♦ and discard other cards, I need to draw 4 more diamonds from 5 new draws. With 15 diamonds left in a 43-card deck, the probability of getting 4 diamonds turns out to be around 4.28%, which is still low. It might be better to keep at least two of one suit, probably hearts or clubs. I think I should keep Q♥, 8♥, and A♦, while considering my discards carefully and planning to use Chariot on position 5!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,5]"}
