{"reasoning":"**Evaluating planetary options**\n\nI'm in PLANET_PACK after acquiring Celestial and need to choose between Neptune, Venus, or Pluto. Our build focuses on flushes, but none of these options provide that. I'm weighing potential pivots: Neptune could lead to a straight flush upgrade, though it's rare; Venus boosts three of a kind, and Pluto ups high card potential. However, our jokers require a flush to score well, so without it, gains are limited. Neptune might be the top choice for those rare straight flush scenarios. Wait, since a straight flush includes a flush, our jokers could activate!\n**Choosing Neptune for benefits**\n\nIf I make a straight flush, I get both flush bonuses and the significant straight flush base, which is great. Neptune increases the base chips and multipliers for straight flushes, making it the most beneficial choice. Venus and Pluto won't contribute to flushes at all. So, it seems like a clear decision—I'll select Neptune. Action: pick 1 (Neptune). No targets to worry about, just focusing on maximizing those bonuses!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
