{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nI'm considering a scenario with \"The Pillar\" where cards played in the Ante are debuffed. This means any cards played beforehand in the small and big blinds would carry a debuff against the boss. If we skip those blinds, then no debuffs apply, making the boss easier. We enter the fight with a base deck that doesn’t include jokers, but I think it's still possible to gain chips through decent hands. After defeating the boss, we can access the shop for rewards.\n**Planning strategies for the game**\n\nI’m laying out a plan: skip the small blind for the Double Tag, and skip the big blind for the Charm Tag. I’ll get a second Charm Tag through the Double, then face the boss without any debuffs. After that, I can open two Mega Arcana packs for free to enhance my deck early. The main risk is failing the boss due to not having jokers, but with a standard deck, reaching 600 chips should be doable in a few hands.\n**Deciding on the skip action**\n\nI’m thinking I should go for the skip chain since the tags are strong. So, my action right now is to skip the round. This seems like a solid move to gather more advantages without taking on unnecessary risks. I wonder how it’ll affect my gameplay later, but focusing on the tags makes sense in this context. Alright, let’s see how this strategy plays out!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
