{"reasoning":"**Calculating chip strategy**\n\nI'm considering the impact of a big chip increase after Neptune. It could greatly benefit the game, especially since winning a blind would be instant if I hit it. But there's still risk involved. Since we beat ante 5 with a solid flush already, I'm estimating ante 6's requirements might need around 6000 for small blind and maybe up to 45000 for the next boss. I should focus on maximizing my flush potential, yet there's no flush planet. Would aiming for a straight flush be realistic? We have suitable diamond cards to work with.\n**Evaluating straight flush strategies**\n\nI see that while a straight flush has low probability, keeping a suited sequence could help in forcing one. If I occasionally hit a straight flush, it can benefit from flush jokers and might improve the overall strategy. Neptune looks good for this potential. However, if I never hit a straight flush, would that be a waste? Also, while two pairs occur often, they might not fit well against bosses. I’m wondering if Uranus is a better option, but it offers a small multiplier. I'll calculate the expected value—maybe a 1% chance for a straight flush across 20 hands might only yield one successful attempt?\n**Choosing planet upgrade**\n\nI’m starting to think that choosing Neptune is the best option since it can significantly boost my straight flush potential. It feels like a game-changer, while other upgrades seem minor. Sure, switching to straights with Saturn might be tempting, but the jokers only support flushes, not straights, so that wouldn’t make sense. So, I’m settling on Neptune and moving to the selection process. For the action, I need to select card position 2 in the plan pack, and I'll format the JSON data correctly for this action.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
