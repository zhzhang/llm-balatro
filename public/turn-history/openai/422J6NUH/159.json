{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot pack options**\n\nI’m considering whether to buy the Arcana pack for tarot, which can enhance my deck or help me remove cards. Unfortunately, I won’t know the contents until after purchasing. I could reroll for a cheaper tarot option, but that would leave me with nothing. The Arcana pack is $4, and it offers a chance at powerful cards like The Sun or The World. I think I’ll go for it, as there are strong cards in this pack. Buying the Scholar card seems less appealing.\n**Considering Joker purchase strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about holding onto cash to buy the Invisible Joker for $8 later. Right now, I have $5, and I could sell others to make up the difference. I wonder if the Invisible Joker is worth it since it duplicates a random joker after two rounds when sold. If I buy it, I could sell it after the boss ante7 and small ante8 rounds to duplicate a joker. However, that $8 requirement means I might need to sell some jokers to get there.\n**Evaluating potential sales and purchases**\n\nIf I sell Juggler for $2, I’d have $7, which is still short. Selling Chad for the same would also leave me at $7. Selling Stuntman for $3 would give me exactly $8, but since Stuntman adds +250 chips, I’m hesitant to part with him. Selling Droll for $4 is definitely out of the question. \n\nI could buy the Arcana pack for $4 now and hope for Temperance, which gives money based on joker sell value. If I get Temperance, that could lead to gaining money, possibly up to $11 from selling other jokers!\n**Considering purchase options for tarot**\n\nI'm looking at the Hermit card, which gives double money (up to $20), and I think having a good money tarot could help me to eventually afford the Invisible Joker. The Death or Hanged Man cards can help remove others. Since I'm focused on gaining power quickly for the boss fight, the Arcana pack could offer strong cards like Strength or The World. My best move seems to be buying the Arcana Pack for $4 and picking the best tarot. I’ll ensure I follow the correct API action for this purchase.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
