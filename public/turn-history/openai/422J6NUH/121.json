{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card interactions**\n\nI'm thinking about how Hanging Chad could potentially retrigger the first scored card. With Wrathful, the retriggers apply to scoring triggers, which is interesting. Wrathful activates when a spade card is scored and gives a +3 multiplier for each spade played. So, if the first card retriggered is a spade, it would add another +6 multiplier with two extra triggers. But we’d need a spade flush and to reorder cards played. Hmm, we have a capacity of five and to buy Wrathful, we need to sell a joker. Which one should that be?\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm considering how the late ante 6 hand size +1 could help find a flush quickly, which seems valuable. Even Steven boosts multipliers for even ranks, and since a flush uses five cards, the expected even ranks are around 2.5, leading to a +10 multiplier on average. Crafty contributes 80 chips, which is great for building the score. Droll also adds a +10 multiplier and a 1.5x boost. It seems Hanging Chad could maximize card value, but I wonder if dropping Juggler for Wrathful will increase multipliers enough for upcoming ante 6 bosses.\n**Planning for ante 6 strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about the ante 6 round structure, where after the big blind, the next step is the boss. Each ante has small, big, and boss rounds, and I note that the ninth round seems crucial. Many bosses can debuff suits, so I need a strong lineup. Juggler might help ensure a flush over four hands. The Blank voucher costs 10, and while it seems basic, it can upgrade to Antimatter, which adds an important joker slot. This makes it strategic to buy the Blank if I anticipate needing Antimatter later.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m looking at our $21. If I buy the Blank voucher, I’ll have $11 left. Rerolls cost 5, so I could go for better jokers or tarot cards, but conservation might be smart here. The Order multiplier isn’t great since we're focused on flushes, and Mars isn’t helping either. I think buying the Blank is a solid long-term move to gain Antimatter and an extra joker slot. It's guaranteed improvement. Plus, I wonder if we might find better flush jokers if we reroll instead, but I feel like the Blank is the way to go now.\n**Deciding on the Blank voucher**\n\nI remember that buying the Blank doesn’t give an immediate boost, but it does unlock the potential for Antimatter to appear in the shop later, which is valuable for adding an extra joker slot. I think it’s a good idea to buy the Blank voucher when offered because of that benefit. While we have $21, which is solid, we should still consider future needs and possible rerolls for flush-related jokers. Overall, I believe purchasing the Blank now is a good move, so let's go ahead with buying it!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
