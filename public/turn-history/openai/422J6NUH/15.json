{"reasoning":"**Evaluating small blind decision**\n\nI need to decide whether to play or skip the small blind. I have $0 and two jokers. Skipping gives me a Polychrome Tag, which is valuable for the next shop, where I can get a free joker. The downside is that skipping means I miss out on a $3 reward. If I skip the small blind, I can still select for the big blind, but I won’t get to shop until I win a blind.\n**Deciding on gameplay strategy**\n\nIf I skip the small blind, I can play the big blind for $4 and then shop afterward. The next shop's Polychrome joker will be free, which is a huge advantage, especially with the upcoming boss that requires 800 chips. That’s a bit intimidating, so I want to prepare. It seems likely I should skip small to get the tag. However, I’m wondering if I can beat the big blind with my current deck and jokers. Scoring well previously gives me some hope!\n**Analyzing hand strategy**\n\nIn Balatro, the small blind consists of 3 hands with 2 discards, and the same goes for the big blind, which feels manageable. If I skip the small blind, I still need to beat the big blind and the boss, who requires a strong single hand of 800. To achieve this, I should aim for a diamond flush, boosting my chips significantly. The boss allows discards, so I might be able to hit the target with a decent hand!\n**Considering strategies and actions**\n\nThe safest option seems to be aiming for a flush. Skipping the small blind allows me to get the Polychrome Tag and likely still beat the big blind with a flush or pairs. However, playing the small blind gives me $3 and a chance to shop, but I'm currently at $0. If I play small and win, I could earn $3 and maybe buy something helpful later. Since the big blind could give me a Boss Tag for a reroll, I think I’ll skip the small blind and proceed with that plan!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
