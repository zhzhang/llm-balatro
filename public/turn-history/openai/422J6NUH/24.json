{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Joker effects**\n\nI'm trying to figure out if x1.5 should come after +10 to maximize effects. It seems like the Joker's effect order is fixed. The polychrome edition triggers in category 5 after the basic Joker effect, and the editions on Jokers apply as independent effects. According to the dev prompt, independent Jokers activate left-to-right, which means I may need to activate the basic effect first, then the edition. I think I’ll leave the order as is and just go ahead with the game round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
