{"reasoning":"**Choosing the best card**\n\nI’m looking at the 4 of Spades bonus card that adds 30 extra chips, but it’s not a diamond. I notice the 5 of Spades is plain. Considering our build, the 9 of Diamonds with a gold + red seal seems like the best option since it adds both a diamond and a red seal. It could be useful for income and deck thinning. So, I think I’ll go for the 9 of Diamonds and select one!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
