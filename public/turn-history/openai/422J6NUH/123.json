{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI’m working through how Even Steven interacts with various ranks and flushes, and it seems having an average of 2.5 evens gives a huge +10 multiplier. Using Hanging Chad retriggers the first card, which could be beneficial if I score well on flush hands. Scary Face works on previously scored jokers, which could really stack the scores, especially if the first card is a face. Each time it triggers, I can gain quite a lot!\n**Preparing for game strategy**\n\nI'm realizing that Even Steven adds a +4 multiplier if the first card is even, so I can reorder cards to maximize this. With Juggler, consistency might be less important. I see that ante 6 has three rounds, with round 9 being the big blind. After beating the ante 6 big blind, I can shop before facing the boss. It’s crucial to prepare for the boss, who might debuff certain cards. Considering options like The Tower, a stone card worth 50 chips, seems smart!\n**Examining flush strategies**\n\nIn a flush hand, a stone card can't help because it has no suit and wouldn't contribute to the flush; it might even break the flush unless it's wild. Although it can be played alongside a flush, it won't score. This isn't great for a flush strategy. I note that Scary Face could be beneficial if I frequently use face cards, but the expected average is only about 1.15 faces per random flush, giving me an extra +34.5 chips.\n**Analyzing chip strategies**\n\nI see that while the gains from the flush might not be huge, the multipliers could significantly boost my chips. If I can get a multiplier of about 25, that translates to around 875 chips, but it’s small compared to a flush score of 20k. Selling Crafty, which adds +80 chips, could bring in an extra 1,600 chips. I should weigh the importance of jokers like Droll and Even Steven, along with the value of consistency in my hand size!\n**Strategizing against bosses**\n\nI'm weighing the pros and cons of Scary Face versus Crafty and considering my options. Scary Face might only average 34 chips, while Crafty's consistent +80 could be more reliable. Juggling my hand consistency seems essential for the ante 6 boss. It might be smart to save my $6 for interest, but there's a risk with the bosses, especially if they debuff flushes or face cards. Maybe investing in Scary Face is wise, but I'd lose out on interest. I need to be cautious and consider alternative strategies!\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nIf a boss debuffs ranks, I should rethink my joker options. Perhaps switching to Scary Face could provide flexibility over Crafty’s chip bonus, which is tough to lose. But losing Hanging Chad might not be wise, as it always triggers. I wonder about buying The Tower, but I need to keep some cash for interest. Scary Face could help, yet I'd need to sell another joker first. Comparing jokers, Scary Face might not outperform Crafty or even Steven. It seems sticking with my current set and saving money for interest might be the best strategy for now!\n**Analyzing joker options**\n\nI’m considering whether Scary Face could outperform Crafty. If I have at least three face cards, it could generate about 90 chips — that’s comparable to Crafty's 80. But the chance of having at least one face card in my flush is around 80%. I need to think about how Scary Face works with Hanging Chad too, which could enhance its scoring. However, if a boss debuffs face cards, Scary Face loses value. Crafty remains reliable, so balancing these factors is key. It’s tricky, but I think keeping Crafty might be safer in uncertain situations!\n**Evaluating joker swap options**\n\nGiven our flush build, I think about how our main weakness may be suit debuffs. I'm considering whether Scary Face would be a valuable upgrade over Crafty. If I sell a joker, I could buy Scary Face for $4 but may also need to keep Crafty due to its reliability. However, Scary Face could offer more flexible scoring while still aiding non-flush hands. Ultimately, I might lean towards swapping Crafty for Scary Face for potential synergy and better scoring without overextending my resources. Saving money could be vital for future upgrades too!\n**Deciding on upgrades for hands**\n\nI'm leaning towards the conservative choice of doing nothing and proceeding with $6, but I have concerns about the boss threshold at ante 6, which could be as high as 100k. With my flush scoring around 20k per hand, I might need more scoring to meet this requirement. Adding Scary Face could boost my average score to 100k across four hands, but rerolling for better jokers is also a consideration. Ultimately, boosting my current flush score seems the most straightforward path forward given upcoming challenges!\n**Planning actions for upgrades**\n\nChad’s potential to raise the multiplier significantly makes it clear that I shouldn’t sell him. Instead, if I want Scary Face, I should consider selling Crafty while keeping Chad and Juggler. Although Crafty adds 80 and Scary adds about 83 with Chad, the difference is minor. Scary gives flexibility for hands that aren’t necessarily flush. I’m leaning towards selling Crafty and then buying Scary. Next step: I’ll plan to sell Crafty first and then buy Scary.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
