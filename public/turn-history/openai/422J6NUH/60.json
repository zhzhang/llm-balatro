{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker options**\n\nI’m in a game shop analyzing jokers: Even Steven and 8 Ball. We have a flush build with specific jokers. Crafty gives +80 chips for flushes, Droll offers a +10 multiplier and multiplies by 1.5 when containing a flush. Greedy adds a multiplier for diamonds, while Gros Michel provides +15 but risks being destroyed each round. I want to play flushes, so I need to decide which joker to replace based on their strengths and weaknesses.\n**Analyzing joker strategies**\n\nSupernova boosts the multiplier based on how many times a poker hand has been played in this run. For flushes, I've played four hands, so that's a +4 multiplier, which isn’t massive. As we continue to play flushes, it will scale up, especially when we ante up later. However, Even Steven seems like a stronger option since it adds +4 for each even card scored in addition to the existing multipliers. This could add up significantly! 8 Ball, while interesting, appears less reliable.\n**Deciding on joker options**\n\nI’m thinking about selling Supernova to free up space. But do we really need more multipliers? Droll's polychrome gives us a good x1.5 already. It seems Even Steven is a better choice compared to Greedy. Greedy adds +3 for each diamond in a flush, which is nice but limited to diamonds. Even Steven offers +4 for even ranks—I expect around 2-3 even cards in a flush, yielding +8-12 multipliers. We could aim for a one-suit flush strategy, but our current deck setup isn't fully clear, and the shop only has jokers right now.\n**Considering rerolls and sales**\n\nThe suit isn’t controllable, so I’m considering a reroll for planets, like Jupiter. The current reroll cost is $7, but I have $22. It might be wise to save some money for later. Spending on a valuable joker seems fine, though. If I buy Even Steven for $4, I’d need to sell a joker, like Supernova for $2, leaving me with $20. The interest next round would be floor(20/5)=4, which is okay. Selling Crafty could yield $80 early, but its value might drop later. Even Steven and Greedy are looking like solid options overall!\n**Planning joker replacements**\n\nSince a flush uses all cards, it makes sense to replace Supernova with Even Steven, which sounds like a solid choice. I could consider 8 Ball for tarot generation, but I'd need 8s in my hand, and we already have the Empress. However, generating tarots has strong potential. Right now, my main priority is to increase my score for upcoming antes. I’ll sell Supernova first to make space before buying Even Steven. I need to execute one action at a time, so I’ll start with sell_joker 3.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
