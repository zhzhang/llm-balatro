{"reasoning":"**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nI'm in a position where I need to decide whether to play or skip on this small bet for the boss tag reroll. Considering my current build, which is flush-based, it looks manageable. The ante of 5 is set at 11,000, and based on past experiences where I cleared an 18k on ante 4 for the big boss, I feel optimistic that I can handle it. Let's weigh my options carefully!\n**Evaluating game options**\n\nI'm considering playing small for a $3 reward, plus leftover hands and interest. However, skipping gives me the boss reroll tag. The upcoming boss has the effect of drawing cards face down, which can be tricky since I won't see the next draws, but I can still see my hand. This seems similar to the boss \"The Fish.\" Skipping small means I lose the reward and hands, but rerolling might be beneficial! I need to weigh my options carefully before deciding.\n**Assessing game strategy risks**\n\nIt seems that with face-down cards, I can select them but won’t know the ranks or suits, making it challenging to create a flush. Rerolling the boss could be crucial for my strategy. Skipping big for a polychrome tag offers a free joker in the shop, but I'd lose out on a $4 reward. I really need to evaluate how dangerous the current boss's effect is for my flush build. If the face-down cards only apply after the first play, I may still have some visibility with my initial hand. I'll need to think this through carefully!\n**Evaluating game decisions**\n\nI'm thinking that face-down cards probably remain hidden until they're scored or discarded, meaning I need to rely on my initial hand to beat the boss in one play. My flush scoring might be around 18k at ante 4, but the boss requires 22k at ante 5, which calls for at least two hands. It seems better to reroll the boss. So, I’ll skip small for the Boss Tag to reroll blind. Skipping means I won’t get the shop or $3 reward, but the safety seems worth it!\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI’m considering whether to skip big for the polychrome tag, but I realize I really need the shop to support my growth. It seems much smarter to play big and earn money while accessing the shop. So, the best course of action now is to skip the current round instead. I'll proceed with that action and return the appropriate JSON with the action set to skip_round. It feels like the right choice!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
