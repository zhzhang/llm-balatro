{"reasoning":"**Considering voucher options**\n\nI'm thinking about the Overstock voucher worth $10, which could be beneficial for long-term shopping. Right now, we have $31. After buying the Banner for $5 and potentially selling Greedy for $2, I calculate we’ll have $28 left. If I buy the Overstock voucher, that brings us down to $18, but we could also consider buying boosters, which might give us better jokers. With those $18, I could get Jumbo Buffoon and Arcana. But since we have full jokers, I might need to sell again if Buffoon gives us a better option.\n**Planning actions in Balatro**\n\nIn Balatro, I see that the interest caps at $5 when we hit $25, and we're currently at $31, so we're close. If we drop below $25, we'll lose that interest. Spending down to $18 would risk that. But maybe keeping some funds for purchases or rerolls is wise. Buying the Banner is affordable, and the order of jokers can be adjusted later. I think my first action should be to sell the Greedy joker for $2, then I can buy the Banner next turn. I’ll plan on executing the sale first.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
