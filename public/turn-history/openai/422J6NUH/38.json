{"reasoning":"**Deciding on actions**\n\nI'm considering using the +80 chips. It seems better to replace Flash with Gros since that gives me +15 independent multiplier versus just +2. For my first action, I think buying the Magic Trick voucher is the way to go since it doesn’t require a slot and it's a solid choice with the funds I have now. I’ll focus on that and make the command to buy the voucher.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
