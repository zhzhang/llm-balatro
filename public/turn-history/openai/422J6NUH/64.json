{"reasoning":"**Figuring out the game mechanics**\n\nI'm at the blind select boss and can't skip, so I need to play the round.

The command does allow me to use the consumable with target card positions, but I can't see the hand right now. So, it seems I should just go ahead and play the round and provide the Action JSON.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
