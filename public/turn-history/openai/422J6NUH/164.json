{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking if we discard, we should have the new cards drawn face up, right? The boss only affects the first hand drawn face down. After we play or discard once, the new hand should be face up. It seems like the best strategy is to discard as little as possible to form a solid hand while saving some discards. Since we have 5 discarded, we need to score 70k in 4 hands, aiming for around 30k-48k with a couple of good flushes. The first step is to discard 5 random face-down cards to draw 5 new face-up cards, leaving 2 face-down.\n**Analyzing hand strategy**\n\nIt looks like I have a hand size of 7, and if I discard 5 cards, I'm left with 2 face-down. The new cards I draw are likely face up, but the remaining cards from my first hand could stay face down, complicating my ability to form a flush. I’m considering discarding all 7, though the command allows for a maximum of 5 cards. I could discard 5 now and the 2 later, but that risks low scoring without a flush. Playing with 5 unknowns might help replace them, but there's a chance of scoring low without good cards.\n**Deciding on discards and strategy**\n\nI'm considering that cards like Stuntman and Droll could still produce some outcomes, but Droll only triggers with a flush. With 4 hands and 5 plentiful discards, I prefer to discard to get known cards and aim for forming a flush. Rearranging the hand doesn’t seem helpful, so maybe I should use consumables. The Hanged Man can destroy up to 2 selected cards, but I can't choose unknowns. \n\nI think for the first action, I should discard 5 cards from positions 1-5 to draw 5 new cards, hopefully face up, while leaving positions 6-7 face down. In the next action, if I decide against keeping them, I can discard positions 6-7. The strategy feels a bit uncertain, but keeping the two face-down to see if they become face up later seems like a plan.\n**Planning discard actions**\n\nI think it's better to play a hand with five unknowns to clear them while keeping two hidden. The next draw might give me five new face-up cards, but I might still need to discard any remaining unknowns. Yet, using a hand could be a missed scoring opportunity. Since I need 70k, losing one hand is manageable if I can score 35k with each flush. Using a \"wash\" hand feels risky, so instead, I should utilize the 5 discards I have. \n\nI’ll discard positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and then if the last 2 are still unknown, I can discard those next. Discarding 2 might leave no unknown cards and 7 total face-up cards, which is great! So to summarize my actions: \n1) Discard positions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. I need to proceed with that in action JSON format without specifying the hand type.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
