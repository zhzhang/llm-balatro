{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nI'm considering the implications of our last flush value of 19k, which suggests we may need either a higher multiplier or chip modifications. Considering combinations like chips around 300 and a multiplier of 65, or different options, is interesting. The concept of retriggering the first card provides significant boosts to both chips and the multiplier, especially through the synergy with Even Steven. Selling cards like Even Steven or Gros Michel would mean losing those valuable boosts. Nice complexity!\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m realizing that Crafty’s chip boost is crucial since it multiplies by the multiplier. However, Juggler could help achieve more flushes with fewer hands, and given we've already hit a 19k flush, it might be overkill. We need to think long-term for scales and ante survival. Crafty has a fixed 80 chips, which might be less valuable than multipliers. Even Steven could work for consistent flushes, but there’s a cap on multiplier from even cards. I’m thinking maybe we should hold off on buying Juggler for now.\n**Considering strategic card choices**\n\nI’m thinking about Crafty’s 80 chips multiplied by the multiplier, which could be significant. However, hand size is also important for consistency, especially for playing flushes against the boss, where discards are reduced. Since we already have The Sun for creating hearts flush, I need to factor in the upcoming boss blinds. Given the high deck size, Juggler could be a valuable addition, so I plan to sell Crafty to make space for Juggler. I’ll sell Crafty first, then consider buying Juggler later.\n**Evaluating card impacts**\n\nI’m analyzing the benefits of Gros Michel, which gives a +15 multiplier, versus Crafty’s chip boost, which might exceed that. If I sell Gros, I reduce risk since it can self-destruct, especially in higher antes, but I might lose the extra multiplier. If I keep Crafty, my score would drop significantly; without it, I could lose 4800 points if the multiplier is around 60. Crafty indeed seems more impactful overall. Juggler, while not adding to the score directly, increases my chances for flushes, aligning with synergy strategies.\n**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nIt looks like we need more consistency moving forward, especially for the ante5 boss, possibly aiming for a target around 40k. Selling Gros Michel would reduce risk due to its potential destruction later, and it seems wise to prioritize stable cards like Juggler. Although Gros adds a +15 multiplier, it applies even on non-flush hands. I’m planning to sell Gros Michel now and look to acquire Juggler. Just need to follow the right format for the sell action.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
