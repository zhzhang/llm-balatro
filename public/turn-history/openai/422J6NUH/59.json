{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shopping strategy**\n\nI need to gather strength for ante 5+, and I'm currently at flush level 2 with good jokers. Maybe I'll target Jupiter for a flush since it would be massive. I'm considering buying playing cards due to a Magic Trick opportunity, but the 2 of clubs feels useless. We managed to clear a big blind, and now I’m focusing on the next boss blind. I'll have to prepare but can't reroll after seeing the boss. Shopping now seems fine, maybe one reroll for a better card?\n**Assessing reroll strategy**\n\nThe reroll cost is 6, and I can do multiple, but I need to think about diminishing returns. With 28 money, I could reroll once for 22, which is still decent. A second reroll would cost 7, becoming 15 afterward with interest at 3. While I'd love to find Jupiter or cards like \"Blueprint,\" those are rare. It might be smarter to end the shop and save for blind selection instead since I think I can manage ante 4. I need to preserve money for interest and future shops. Using the tarot Empress during a round is an option before playing, so my next action should be to proceed with round_select.\n**Considering reroll options**\n\nRerolling could give me valuable planets or jokers, but there's a risk of overspending. Since I have 28 money and the next ante is scaling, I might want to fish instead. However, I have full joker slots, meaning I'd need to sell one to get a new joker. The strong synergy in my flush is impressive, and upgrading the flush hand to something like Jupiter would be a big boost, even if it's not in the shop. Rerolling could possibly reveal more slots, which is promising!\n**Deciding on reroll investment**\n\nSpending 6 for a reroll seems worth it for a chance at Jupiter or other planets, and if it doesn't pay off, I can halt there. My flush is at level 2, which I might need for upcoming antes 5-8. Getting Jupiter early could be very valuable. So I'll take one reroll; with 22 left, the interest at the end of the next round would be $4, which isn't terrible. I think I'll go ahead and do a reroll in the shop.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
