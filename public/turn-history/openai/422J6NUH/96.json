{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI’m considering how Droll’s modifiers work: a +10 multiplier and a x1.5 multiplier. Since these are independent, the order doesn’t impact the result. But if there were effects that depend on current values, that might change things. I know we want to avoid club cards with the boss debuff since they won't add chips, although they can still form a flush. I’m also uncertain about how debuffed cards affect Even Steven's +4 multiplier.\n**Clarifying Even Steven mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about how Even Steven’s ability works with played cards that are of even rank, giving a +4 multiplier when scored. If a debuffed card is played, does it still activate the joker effect? Typically, a debuffed card disables chip values and modifiers, but according to the rules, the joker should still contribute. So, I believe Even Steven can still add that +4 multiplier even if the card itself is debuffed. It seems that works!\n**Exploring scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m analyzing how abilities apply to Even Steven, which triggers when a played card with an even rank is scored. That’s separate from the card's ability, so it seems yes, it still works. However, with debuffed clubs, those chip values are disabled, reducing points from club ranks. We previously scored 19k on a flush, aiming for a 22k threshold, which might need two hands. I can't use the Sun card to convert to hearts right now since targets aren't available. The next action is to play a round!\n**Determining scoring order**\n\nI’m considering how Even Steven works: it adds a +4 multiplier each time a card is scored. If the first card retriggered with Chad is even, we’d gain a total of +12 multipliers for that card. If it’s odd, we don’t get anything. Ideally, we want the first card to be even, but the order of cards won’t affect the outcome. Since I can’t rearrange during a round, I’ll just proceed to play the round and prepare the output action in JSON format.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
