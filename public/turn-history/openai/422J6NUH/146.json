{"reasoning":"**Choosing tarot options**\n\nI’m looking at the options from the tarot pack: The Star, Death, and Emperor. The Star seems beneficial since I can convert up to three cards to Diamonds, which improves our diamond density. I need to decide which high-value cards to convert. In hand, I have a mix including Q spades and 10 clubs bonus. Converting the 10 clubs could increase our chances for a flush with bonus chips! I’ll consider that more closely.\n**Deciding tarot card strategy**\n\nIt looks like I can retrigger a card once with the red seal, which would be fantastic. I’m leaning towards choosing The Star and targeting positions 1, 2, 5, and maybe 3 since it allows converting the best cards: 10C bonus, 3S retrigger, and Q♠ into diamonds. This will permanently enhance my deck. However, if I use Death, I could duplicate the 10C bonus by transforming a card into it. I just have to be mindful of the suit changes involved!\n**Choosing tarot card strategy**\n\nI’m weighing my options between the Emperor, which could give me random tarot cards, or sticking with The Star for a safer choice. Given that I have limited resources and only 2 money, it feels wiser to select The Star to guarantee an improvement in my flush reliability. I’ll go ahead and target cards 1, 2, and 5 in the pack. The command I need is: select 1, 1, 2, 5.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1,2,5]"}
