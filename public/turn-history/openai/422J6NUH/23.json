{"reasoning":"**Considering next actions**\n\nI'm weighing my options in the shop since I only have $1. I could do a round select for the next blind. Selling a joker might help, but the math is tricky here. If I sell greedy and crafty jokers, I'd have enough to buy something useful. Yet, losing those key cards could hurt my scoring. Standard packs could improve my chances, maybe I should just keep the jokers and move on.\n**Deciding my strategy**\n\nI think it’s better to hold onto my power to beat the blinds for now, as I can always generate more money later. Having $1 feels low, but it’s enough to work with. I’m leaning toward using round_select as my next move. It seems like the most strategic choice at this moment. I just need to stay alert and see how things unfold from here!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
