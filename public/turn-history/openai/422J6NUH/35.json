{"reasoning":"**Planning a strategy**\n\nI'm laying out a game plan to play with my hands: 10H, 9H, 5H, steel3H, and 2H. I estimate that my chip count will be around 4300-4500, so I'll go with an integer of 4400. Next, I'll make sure to output the action play with positions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] using the intended hand type of \"flush,\" along with that estimated chip count.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
