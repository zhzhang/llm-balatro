{"reasoning":"**Selecting a card strategy**\n\nI'm currently in a situation where I need to select a second card after picking card 5 from the Mega Standard pack. With options 1-4 remaining, I'm focusing on building a flush. Since any suited card helps, I want to avoid stone due to its lack of suit. Comparing options: the foil 2♣ gives a solid +52 chips, while 2♠ and 6♠ provide lesser value. So, I’m going to select foil 2♣!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
