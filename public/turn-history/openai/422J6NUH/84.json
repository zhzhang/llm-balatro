{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nIt's not always necessary to secure a win with just one hand. However, I think we can aim for a flush plus a small hand. I need to ensure we have enough options. Keeping a steel in hand might increase our multiplier, but playing a flush without 3 hearts won’t work since we only have four hearts. I might consider using a wild card or going for a straight or a pair instead. It’s tricky, but a heart flush could score well.\n**Clarifying flush strategy**\n\nI'm trying to determine the difference between previous flush plays, like the last one that scored 18,150 chips in Ante4 Big. I'm unsure if that included a steel card in hand, and there may have been up to four discards which could contribute another 120 chips. My initial estimate might be low, but we could still exceed 16,500. We have bonus and multiplier cards, but they can't contribute to a flush since they're off-suit. Stone cards don’t count toward a flush, according to Balatro's rules.\n**Exploring hand options**\n\nI’m thinking about how the stone card can be played but won't contribute to a flush, since a flush requires five cards of the same suit. Instead, I could discard to try and fish for another heart to replace the steel and keep it in hand. Right now, I have five hearts including steel, but if I discard some non-heart cards, I could aim to get six hearts and still play a flush. That would trigger the steel multiplier! With two discards left, I could discard the 10C, 4D, or stone to draw hearts, but I need at least one heart — the odds are about 18%.\n**Calculating discard strategy**\n\nIf I discard three cards, the chance of drawing at least one heart is about 46%. That doesn't seem that great. I have two discards left, which limits my options since I can't discard five cards. However, if I discard three now and miss, I could still play a flush with the steel card. If I discard non-heart cards, my flush remains intact with the five hearts. So, it's a low-risk move, although it does reduce banner chips by 30 per discard. But keeping the steel might compensate for that loss. If I don't discard, the banner adds 60 chips but I'd have no steel.\n**Analyzing discard strategy for optimal hand**\n\nIf I discard one card, my banner increases by 30 chips, but keeping the steel card boosts the multiplier by 1.5, which is significant. I need five non-steel hearts for a flush and may want to replace a non-heart card. Discarding three cards has a 46% chance to draw at least one heart, but I can also discard two non-hearts for a 33% chance. The optimal move seems to be discarding three non-heart cards for a better chance at that heart. This way, I also keep the steel card to maximize my score.\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI think I’ll go ahead with one discard to try and draw a heart, and then I can play the flush. My plan is to discard cards 6, 7, and 8. That way, I’m maximizing my chances of getting that heart I need for the flush. I’ll make sure to craft my action output to reflect this decision clearly. This approach feels promising!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [6,7,8]"}
