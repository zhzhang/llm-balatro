{"reasoning":"**Planning investments and scaling**\n\nI'm thinking we can spend down to $25 while still maximizing interest. Since money isn't crucial now, it’s better to invest for scaling up to ante 4+. Our current flush is strong (4500 in ante 3 boss). With ante 4, thresholds will increase, so I need to scale more. Ideally, I want to level up Jupiter to improve the flush or get more multipliers. Rerolling the Flash Card a few times seems beneficial, as it adds permanent multipliers, but costs $5 each time.\n**Evaluating card packs**\n\nI’m considering the Standard packs, which usually add just base playing cards, but I wonder if they can include enhancements or special editions. With the Standard Pack, I can choose from three cards, and they might have enhancements included. Mega packs provide two of five cards, which seems better for improving my deck with valuable cards like steel or gold. While we already have a steel heart, more steel cards could increase my multipliers significantly. With $40 available, buying a Mega Standard pack for $8 seems like a smart move.\n**Considering card purchases**\n\nI’m thinking about buying the Magic Trick for $10, which would let me purchase playing cards directly, including suited cards that could help me aim for a diamond flush. Even though we already achieved a heart flush, adding diamonds could boost our scaling further. The Magic Trick will allow us to buy specific diamond cards when available, which is beneficial for the long term. However, since we have full joker slots, if I want new jokers through rerolls, I might need to sell something like the Flash Card, which isn't as strong until scaled.\n**Planning for future rounds**\n\nIf we play the flush consistently every round, like 1-3 times per blind, we could reach multipliers of +20 or even +30, which sounds great! Droll adds +10 and x1.5, while Crafty gives us +80 chips. Greedy provides +3 per diamond, up to +15 if we have all diamonds, though that’s not always guaranteed. The Flash Card can scale to provide independent multipliers and gains +2 per reroll. Since I currently have $40, I’m thinking of buying the Magic Trick voucher now and then consider a mega pack and rerolls afterward. Since our joker slots are full, we need to sell something to make new purchases possible.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI’m considering rerolling to find the Jupiter planet or perhaps a tarot card for iron, but the shop currently only has the Earth planet. We should do at least one reroll to help scale the Flash Card. However, I need to choose my next action wisely. Buying the Magic Trick voucher is important as it’s a strong permanent upgrade. Rerolling might allow new cards, but the voucher remains untouched. \n\nSo, I think the best immediate action is to reroll to catch Jupiter and boost the Flash Card multiplier. Rerolling gives me the potential benefits without losing anything, and the Flash Card gains +2 multiplier for each reroll. Therefore, let’s go with reroll_shop as the next action. I'll prepare to generate the necessary JSON for this action now.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
