{"reasoning":"**Deciding next actions in blind select**\n\nI'm thinking about how to handle the blind select part. We can rearrange without any costs, and then move on to play the next round. It makes sense to consider rearranging the jokers for better scoring, even if the improvement is marginal. I’m proposing a new order: 1 Greedy, 5 Even Steven, 2 Crafty, 3 Gros Michel, and 4 Droll. I’ll finalize the new list of indices as [1,5,2,3,4]. Yes!\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,5,2,3,4]"}
