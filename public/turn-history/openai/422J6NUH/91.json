{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m thinking about how a standard pack can add useful heart cards, but might give random ones instead. The Credit Card isn’t really necessary since I already have good economy. It's puzzling whether I should buy it, given that it uses a joker slot and would put me in the negative. If I choose Juggler instead, it occupies a slot too, but it might be worth it since we are aiming for more jokers. I should consider rerolling for better jokers afterwards!\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m considering that if I fill my joker slots, I can't buy more without selling some cards. It might be wise to keep one slot open for new jokers. Right now, I have four, and buying Juggler would take me to five, leaving no room for future cards—though I can always sell later if needed. The order of jokers matters, like aiming for high-value cards for scoring. Overall, my best next step is to buy Juggler for consistency, so I’ll go ahead and use the command to buy it!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
