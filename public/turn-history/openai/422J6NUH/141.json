{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI'm considering how to make a 5-card flush with diamonds. I currently have JD, 7d, and 6d, which gives me only 3 diamonds. I realize I need to draw 2 more from the remaining cards. With 4 discards allowed, it makes sense to keep my diamonds and discard the non-diamonds like Qs, Qh, Jc, and 10c to improve my chances of drawing diamonds. The deck should have 50 cards left after my initial draws, even though I started with 52. But wait, that doesn't seem quite right...\n**Calculating diamond probability**\n\nI see that with 50 cards left, some must have been removed earlier. I need to calculate the probability of drawing diamonds with 12 diamonds in the deck. After keeping my 3 diamonds and discarding 4 non-diamonds, I realize that discarding doesn’t change the diamond ratio significantly since we don’t have info on the discard pile. \n\nSo, for my 4 draws, I expect about 0.96 diamonds. To find the chance of getting at least 2 diamonds, I’ll use hypergeometric calculations. From what I’ve figured, the probability of at least 2 diamonds might be around 0.24, which isn't great. Maybe I should consider keeping more cards instead.\n**Considering hand strategies**\n\nI’m pondering whether to aim for a flush with diamonds since I only have one heart to work with, which isn't helpful. With 4 discards and multiple hands to manage, I might still make it work. Alternatively, I could consider playing two pair for some quick chips, but it seems that would yield way less — maybe just a few thousand chips. \n\nIf I get two pair with Qs/Qh and Jc/Jd, I’d add up some base chips and scoring cards. However, without even ranks or useful enhancements, I might come up short where chips are concerned.\n**Evaluating scoring scenarios**\n\nI’m considering how the bonus card would interact with the two pair hand. It looks like the bonus from 10 clubs adds +30 chips if scored but wouldn’t count towards the two pair if used as a kicker. If I make a full house, that could change things, but I don’t think that’s happening here.\n\nWith two pair, if Chad retriggers the scoring for the first card thrice, I could end up adding chips multiple times. Putting that together, it seems I can get to a total of 330 chips, factoring in base points, retriggers, and the Independent Stuntman bonus.\n**Planning for flush strategy**\n\nI’m focusing on achieving a diamond flush while considering the best use of my cards. Even with the base chips, it looks like I can reach a total of 330 chips, factoring in the Stuntman bonus. The Droll and even ranks also contribute to potential multipliers, making two pair less attractive for scoring.\n\nGiven that I need to keep drawing diamonds, I plan to discard all non-diamonds to maximize my chances. If I can draw to 5 diamonds with JD included, I’ll play my flush. Balancing the odds, it’s crucial to prioritize achieving the flush over holding onto bonus cards. So, discarding with the goal in mind is essential!\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI’m thinking about discarding up to 5 cards. It seems best to keep all my diamonds to help make the flush, so I probably shouldn’t discard one of them. As for the cards in my hand, I have Qs, Qh, Jc, 10c, JD, 7d, and 6d. It makes sense to discard the first four: Qs, Qh, Jc, and 10c. I’ll use the discard command for those. I don’t need to worry about any boss here, so I can proceed!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4]"}
