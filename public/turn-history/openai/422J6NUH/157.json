{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nIt seems we don't have a queen heavy deck, which affects our ranks; about 8% chance with queens. Holding queens gives us some multiplication benefits, but hand size is reduced. We could still potentially play a flush while holding two queens, but it feels unreliable. There’s also the concern about boss debuffs affecting face cards. \n\nAdditionally, I found the Invisible Joker can duplicate after a few rounds, but we’re maxed on jokers, so I need to evaluate what to drop. I’m debating between the Juggler and Even Steven.\n**Analyzing flush strategies**\n\nI'm looking at our flush base multiplier, which is 12. Plus, Droll offers another +10 multipliers and a 1.5x boost, while Polychrome gives another 1.5x. The Stuntman adds 250 chips independently, which is nice. Hanging Chad retriggers the first scoring card, which is particularly useful for high ranks or enhancements.\n\nI believe prioritizing consistent scaling with Wasteful Voucher will help us out a lot; gaining an extra discard for $10 is valuable for building flushes, especially with upcoming bosses. We have $13, so after buying the voucher, we'll have $3 left for jokers.\n**Considering purchase options**\n\nI’m weighing whether to buy the Scholar for $4, but that’s not happening right now. I could skip the voucher to buy the Invisible, but the voucher feels like the best long-term investment. Alternatively, I could get the Invisible for $8 and an Arcana pack for $4, totaling $12, which would leave me with just $1, but I worry about needing that extra joker slot.\n\nLooking at the remaining rounds, we're in ante7, with just three rounds left to win the run. Buying Wasteful for an extra discard in these last rounds seems crucial, while the Invisible will take time to charge. If I buy it now before facing the boss, I could sell it at ante8 big.\n**Evaluating post-boss strategy**\n\nAfter the boss round, I'll have a chance to duplicate something before the next big round, which could be huge if I duplicate Droll. However, I’ll need to hold onto a joker slot for two rounds, meaning I may need to replace someone now, which might weaken my performance against the boss.\n\nMaybe dropping Even Steven would be wise since it's not essential for the flush, allowing me to add Invisible. But my budget is tight with the voucher. I could buy both, but that exceeds my funds. Selling jokers for a bit of cash is an option, but I’d be losing something valuable. Perhaps I should focus on buying Invisible and skipping the voucher, though that's a risky choice.\n**Strategizing for the boss**\n\nFor facing the boss, I know I need a flush, but with only one discard and a hand size of seven, it could be tricky, especially with unknown boss effects. Discards might help, though. Arcana packs could give me tarot cards for deck modifications, but with $13, buying Wasteful and an Arcana pack is just out of reach.\n\nIf I sell Even Steven for $2, I can buy both Wasteful and the Arcana pack, but I question if that’s a good trade. I’d rather keep my flush potential intact, so buying a discard voucher seems like a better option—though I’m also considering Shoot the Moon, which could be powerful but requires more money. Ultimately, I decide to go with the voucher for now.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
