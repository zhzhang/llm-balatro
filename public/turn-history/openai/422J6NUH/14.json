{"reasoning":"**Leaving the shop**\n\nI'm in a shop, but I've only got $0, making it impossible to buy anything. The Fool is $3, Jumbo Celestial is $6, and the voucher costs $10 — all out of reach. Rerolling is $5, which I also can't afford. So, it looks like I have to exit the shop and move on to the next round! This situation is kind of a bummer, but I guess that's how it goes.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
