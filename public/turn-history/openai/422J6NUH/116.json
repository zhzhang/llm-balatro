{"reasoning":"**Considering celestial pack options**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to buy a Jumbo Celestial pack for flush planets. Currently, we have Jupiter, which helps level up the flush. A Jumbo pack might give us another Jupiter or beneficial planets like Saturn. For $6, it seems worth it since it helps to scale our flush. I estimate potential needs based on ante and boss blind chips—possibly up to 90k in Balatro? I need to finalize my next move with a single command.\n**Using consumable Jupiter**\n\nI'm thinking it’s best to use the Jupiter consumable first because it's immediate, has no cost, and doesn’t affect shop offerings. I’ll go ahead with the action `use_consumable` for position 1. This will free up a consumable slot and improve my flush level. The next logical step might be to buy a booster after that. For the JSON response, I'll set positions to [1], indicating the use of the first consumable without targets.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
