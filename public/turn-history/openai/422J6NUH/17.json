{"reasoning":"**Calculating flush probabilities**\n\nI’m working through some card probabilities. First, I calculated the base values, which added up to around 150. Then, when calculating a diamond flush, I realized I need to draw at least 3 more diamonds from the new cards. With about 14 diamonds left in a 44-card deck, I determined that I have roughly 31.8% chance for this. The math leads to around a 19% probability for drawing the necessary cards if I discard 5. My strategy will involve aggressive discards to achieve the flush.\n**Planning card discards**\n\nSo, I’m thinking about my card strategy. I’ve decided to discard the 2♠, K♥, A♣, J♣, and 9♣, which leaves me with 3♥ (steel), K♦, and 4♦. After discarding, I’ll draw 5 new cards to expand my hand to 8 cards. The next step is to decide which cards to discard from the new ones, aiming to choose the best play for my overall strategy. It’s all about optimizing the hand now!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
