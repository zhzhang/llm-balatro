{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m in the shop with $10 and a solid flush build. My cards provide various bonuses, like Crafty giving me chips if I hit a flush. I want to keep some discards for Banner’s chip bonus. I’m considering buying the Pluto planet for its high card value, but honestly, it may not fit since I’m focused on the flush. Rerolling for a better joker seems tempting, but I might save money for better options later. Keeping $5 for interest at the end of the round sounds smart too.\n**Analyzing spending strategies**\n\nIf I keep $10, I'll earn $2 in interest. If I reroll for $5, I'll be left with $5 and lose $1 in interest; I’ll only gain $1 instead. While finding a better joker sounds tempting, I already have Magic Trick and Overstock, but there are no cards available in the shop. Buying Pluto for $3 could provide benefits for the boss fight, but it's a small investment with modest returns. Spending $3 will leave me with $7, so I’d still get $1 in interest, making Pluto effectively cost me $2.\n**Considering insurance options**\n\nIt’s tempting to buy Pluto as insurance because my high card is weak, especially with bosses that could restrict options or lead to bad draws. But I might benefit more by keeping the full $10 for future purchases. Still, leveling Pluto gives me 10 chips and 1 multiplier, which could work well with my jokers. Meanwhile, Banner consistently provides chips. Even Steven and Gros Michel offer multipliers too, and with Pluto, I could get a base of 15 chips and a multiplier of 2. It might be useful!\n**Deciding on consumable purchase**\n\nI see that Pluto is available as a planet card in the shop, and I can buy it since I have room for consumables; I'm at 0 out of 2 slots. Using the buy_card command, I can purchase it, and it goes right into my consumables. It’s cheap, and using it immediately could level up my High Card, which sounds good! I think I’ll go with buy_and_use_consumable for Pluto to take advantage of its benefits now, keeping $7 for later.\n**Assessing financial strategy and next steps**\n\nI'm debating whether to hold onto $10 for interest or spend part of it. Keeping $7 would only give me $1 in interest per round, which isn't ideal, especially since I want to beat ante 8. While Pluto isn’t particularly powerful, I think it might be better to reroll for stronger options instead. My scoring from flush and jokers looks decent, possibly around 12,000 chips, which might be enough to continue without purchases. I’ll proceed to round select instead of buying Pluto, keeping my options open.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
