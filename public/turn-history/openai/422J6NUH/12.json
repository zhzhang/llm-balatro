{"reasoning":"**Considering UI and purchases**\n\nI think there might be a UI bug here. The Fool’s supposed effect could be trying to create The Tower. But since we haven't used any tarot or planet, The Fool likely doesn't do anything. However, it seems like a secondary indication might suggest it will create The Tower, given that it was last used. In run metadata, no consumables have been used, meaning The Fool might be pointless. Buying the Buffoon Pack for $4 to get another joker seems helpful. Having an extra joker could boost scoring for upcoming blinds, so I'll go ahead and buy it.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
