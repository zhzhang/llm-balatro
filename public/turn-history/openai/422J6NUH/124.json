{"reasoning":"**Calculating card scoring with retriggers**\n\nRetriggers allow the card to score repeatedly, so I can earn +30 each time. If the first card is a face, and it retriggers twice, that means a total of three scoring events, yielding +60 chips from Scary Face. Adding base chips for the card means I get +90 chips from one face card. Other faces contribute +30 each, giving me a reliable total over 80 if I ensure at least one face in a flush. The probability of getting any face among five cards is around 67%.\n**Considering card options**\n\nCrafty triggers a one-time +80 chips if I have a flush in hand, but it isn’t retriggerable. Scary Face, on the other hand, adds value for each face card and can stack. Since we've already sold Crafty, I need to decide whether to buy Scary Face or The Tower. The Tower gives a stone card worth +50 chips, with no rank or suit, which means it can't be part of a flush. However, the stone card still counts for scoring chips when played.\n**Evaluating card value for hands**\n\nI realized that cards only score if they’re part of the highest hand. Since the stone card has no rank or suit, it can't contribute to a flush, making it worthless for flush hands. If I pivot to high card or five-of-a-kind, then maybe it has some value. I think I should buy Scary Face for $4. There’s also the option to buy Neptune. While straight flushes are possible with a flush deck, I should focus on getting a flush right now.\n**Analyzing buying options and strategy**\n\nIt’s not a reliable choice, but it could pay off for just $3. I wonder if there's a boss that punishes flush hands; that would suggest diversifying. With $8, I could buy Neptune for $3 and Scary Face for $4, which totals $7 and leaves me with $1. However, that would break my interest, which is only $0. After the big blind, we’ll have one more shop before facing the boss. It seems like buying Scary Face and keeping $4 might be smarter, especially since interest isn’t sufficient.\n**Deciding on card purchases and strategies**\n\nI’m weighing buying Neptune and Scary Face while leaving $1, but I should really keep at least $5 to earn interest after facing the boss. Interest is calculated based on my cash at the end of each round, so I should maintain cash for that. If I buy Scary Face for $4, I lose that interest for better points. Based on my scoring needs and potential flush strategy, buying Scary Face seems like a good move, especially with an empty joker slot. I still need to ponder if acquiring Neptune would also be beneficial.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nIt's challenging without any deck manipulation, so I might consider buying The Tower, but it only gives a stone card, which isn't very useful. I think I'll skip that option. Instead, I'll choose to buy a card to fill my joker slots. Currently, I have four jokers, and buying Scary Face will bring me to five. After that purchase, I’ll move to the round selection, but for now, my next action is simply to buy the card. I'll prepare that in JSON format.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
