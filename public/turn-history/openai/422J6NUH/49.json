{"reasoning":"**Evaluating Skip Tag value**\n\nI'm analyzing the Skip Tag; it seems strong early on. If I take the tag by skipping a blind, I might gain $30 right now, considering there have been 6 skipped blinds already. Skipping for $30 seems worthwhile, yet there’s a risk since it could reduce scaling for Supernova. Supernova multiplies based on the number of hands played, which could mean fewer opportunities for scaling if I skip. Still, I need the money for upgrades, making this a tough choice!\n**Analyzing Supernova and Gros Michel**\n\nSupernova adds the number of times a poker hand is played to the multiplier. For a flush hand, if I play it now, it seems to add +3. But I wonder if this count is before or after playing? It’s likely inclusive, meaning if I skip, it stays at +3. If I play flush, it might count as 4 afterward. Skipping could preserve Gros Michel from destruction at the end of a round, which feels beneficial. The Droll Polychrome multiplier is impressive too!\n**Weighing options for skipping rounds**\n\nI’m considering choosing to skip the round for $30. However, we only have $4 currently. If I skip, the tag gives $5 per skipped blind, and I believe that money comes instantly based on skipped blinds. This could boost my total to $34. I could also skip the big blind to get a foil tag, which is valuable. But if I skip both blinds for two tags, I have to face the boss without a shop, which feels risky given the ante required!\n**Deciding on action for the round**\n\nI’ve scored around 4-5k per flush before, and with scaling, I might achieve 18-20k over four flushes. That gives me a chance to play around 5 hands, which seems feasible since the boss typically has the same. However, skipping both blinds might reduce income. Still, if I skip the small blind, I secure $30 and might get a free joker from the foil tag later. This could be risky, but focusing on the current action feels right. I'll skip the small blind and return the action as JSON.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
