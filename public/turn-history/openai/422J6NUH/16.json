{"reasoning":"**Calculating flush scoring**\n\nI'm figuring out how chips are added during a game involving a flush. When a hand contains a flush, it looks like I’ll add chips before applying multipliers. For example, if I get five diamonds in a flush, that can add a multiplier totaling +15. \n\nLet's say the base chips for a flush is 35 and that I earn around 40 chips from card ranks. Adding everything together, I estimate 155 total chips to score. When multiplying, I get 2945, easily surpassing my goals!\n**Evaluating scoring for hands**\n\nOkay, I'm crunching numbers here. Crafty's +80 plus base chips of 75 leads to 155 total chips. Multiplying that by 4 gives me 620, which isn't enough to reach the 800 goal. To achieve that, I might need a diamond flush or something even higher, like a straight with diamonds.\n\nI realize that cards of the diamond suit add multipliers during scoring, and while a flush maximizes those, I could still get boosts with other hand types. For boss battles, having a diamond-heavy hand appears essential. Plus, I should explore shop options with the polychrome tag!\n**Planning the strategy for shops**\n\nI'm figuring out the best approach to reach the shop by defeating the big blind. If I skip directly to the boss, I’d miss the chance to shop between the blinds. After beating the boss, I realize I'd actually go to the shop at the start of the next ante.\n\nBeating the big blind first allows for crucial shop access, which can let me use the polychrome tag to get a free joker before facing the boss. So, the plan is to play the big blind, win, then shop for an advantage before tackling the boss.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
