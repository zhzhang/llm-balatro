{"reasoning":"**Considering card purchase options**\n\nI'm in a shop with $8, trying to figure out what to buy. I have the cards Mad Joker and Egg, and a standard pack costs $4. Rerolling is $7, but I think I should focus on stronger cards for my flush build. While the Egg might be an investment, it could slow my deck improvement. Buying a standard pack seems smart since it could yield better cards. I wonder if I should buy both the Egg and the standard pack, but I need to be strategic!\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI think I should just buy the standard pack and keep $4 for flexibility for my next shop visit. It seems like a good idea since interest might still be 0. I considered rerolling for $7 to find a better planet or joker, but that would leave me short on resources. Buying the Egg could help generate money long-term, but it might not be the best choice right now. So, my action is to buy the standard pack and choose the best card for my flush and diamond synergy!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
