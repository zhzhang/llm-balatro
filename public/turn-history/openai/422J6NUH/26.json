{"reasoning":"**Calculating flush play**\n\nI'm figuring out my strategy for the flush. So, I calculated mult as (6+10)*1.5, which gives me 24. Then, with a final score of 168 multiplied by 24, I get 4032 chips, which is well over 800. I should play the flush immediately without discarding any cards. I need to use exactly these 5 hearts in positions 4 to 8: Ace, Jack, 7, 6, and 4 of hearts. My estimated chip count should be around 4000.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
