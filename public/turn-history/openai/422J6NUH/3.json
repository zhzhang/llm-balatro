{"reasoning":"**Clarifying stone card rules**\n\nI'm trying to understand how the stone card works in this game. It seems like I can play it as an extra 50 chips without changing the hand type. But I wonder if it scores even when it isn’t part of the highest hand. In the actual game of Balatro, playing the stone card gives a guaranteed 50 chips. But here, only cards that participate in the hand score. I'll play it safe and go with Chariot instead since it’s more reliable. I’ll also target the 3 of Hearts at hand position 3.\n**Selecting card positions**\n\nI’m trying to decide on the command to select position 3. I just realized the pack positions are: 1 is Strength, 2 is The World, 3 is The Chariot, and 4 is The Tower. So I’ll go ahead and select position 3, which is The Chariot. That seems straightforward, and I’m feeling confident about that choice! Time to proceed with this selection.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,3]"}
