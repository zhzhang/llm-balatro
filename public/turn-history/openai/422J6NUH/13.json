{"reasoning":"**Choosing the Joker Card**\n\nI need to pick a joker card from the options: The Idol or Crafty Joker. The Greedy Joker gives a +3 multiplier per diamond card scored. The Idol provides a x2 multiplier for a played 5 of Diamonds, but it changes each round, creating unpredictability. That could be powerful if I can consistently play it. Crafty Joker gives +80 chips for a Flush, which is reliable but depends on getting the right hands. It might not synergize with Greedy since it focuses on diamonds, not flushes.\n**Deciding on the Joker Card**\n\nI’m looking at the benefits of having a Greedy Joker for diamonds in a flush, which gives a multiplier for each diamond played. The Crafty Joker, on the other hand, consistently adds chips if I have a flush. Since I need something reliable for scaling and there's no other joker, I think I’ll go with Crafty for flush builds. It offers 80 extra chips, which is significant. I’ll select Crafty in position 2 of the pack.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
