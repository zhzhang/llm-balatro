{"reasoning":"**Considering flush play strategy**\n\nI’m focusing on the flush strategy, debating whether to play a higher card than 7. I have two 7s, but I need to choose based on chip values among the diamonds. Selecting 4♦ increases my multiplier, and although using 7 may improve chips, I’d lose some synergy. I'm ordering my cards as 9, 6, 4, 5, 7, but I'm uncertain about how scoring works—presumably, the played cards score left-to-right based on their order.\n**Planning card play strategy**\n\nI'm considering using the rearrange_hand function to position 4♦ on the far left within my played cards. However, I think the simplest approach is to start with the play list beginning with 9, as it seems to be the best option. So, I'll play in the order of 9, 6, 4, 5, and 7, aiming for a flush type. With these cards, my estimated chip count is around 17,500.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [9,6,4,5,7]"}
