{"reasoning":"**Rearranging order**\n\nI need to adjust the current order: I want \"Droll\" to be last and \"Gros\" to be placed before it. The original order is 1 Greedy, 2 Crafty, 3 Supernova, 4 Droll, 5 Gros. By assigning new indices to them, I can restructure it to be 1, 2, 3, 5, 4. This will successfully place \"Gros\" at position 4 and \"Droll\" at the end. Let's get that sorted!\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,5,4]"}
