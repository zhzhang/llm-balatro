{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop purchases**\n\nI'm at the shop after beating the big blind in round 5. Now I need to think about what to buy with my $42. The shop has options like Saturn and Mercury, but I want to build a flush. I should consider rerolling for flush planets or jokers that might boost my hand. Next, there's a boss blind in ante 4, and I might need around 20,000 chips for that. Rerolls cost $5, but I have enough to spare, and adding cards could enhance my deck.\n**Evaluating card purchases**\n\nI already have the Magic Trick, so I can buy cards later. The Jumbo Standard pack costs $6 and offers enhanced cards, which could be beneficial. I want to consider purchasing Saturn or Mercury, but I'm not aiming for a straight flush. However, Saturn might increase my chances for a flush. With $42 and no consumables, I could buy the Jumbo pack, then reroll for jokers or a flush planet like Jupiter. I'll also need to consider selling one joker since I'm at capacity.\n**Assessing joker options**\n\nI’m evaluating the jokers I have: Gros Michel gives a +15 multiplier, so I’ll keep it unless it's destroyed. Greedy offers a +3 multiplier per diamond, which is great if we have a flush of mostly diamonds. If not, I might prefer a different joker. Crafty just gives +80 chips with a flush present, which isn’t impressive. Supernova multiplies by the number of times a flush is played but seems weak too. Since the shop has no jokers, I think I should buy the Jumbo Standard pack for a chance at a strong enhanced diamond and reserve enough for rerolls later.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
