{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card purchases**\n\nI need to decide whether to buy Mad Joker, Egg, or none. Our build is focused on flushes, with cards that provide significant multipliers for flush combinations. Mad Joker doesn’t really fit because he’s for two pairs. Egg could potentially be an investment since it has sell value, but I’d have to sell one of my jokers to make room. The question is, which joker should I sell? Greedy gives a multiplier, but is it worth it?\n**Assessing deck strategy**\n\nI’m pushing for a diamond flush, but I’m worried the deck might not have enough diamonds. Crafty is great for flush multipliers, plus Supernova adds a multiplier that scales with more flushes played. Gros Michel offers a good boost, but I'm concerned about the risk of it being destroyed at the end of the round. Droll gives significant support too, so Greedy might end up being the weakest link. Egg is purely economic; I'm wondering if it’s worth it right now. It could help with future upgrades, but it also takes a slot and doesn’t contribute to scoring.\n**Weighing joker options**\n\nI still have 5 jokers, and replacing Greedy with Egg might reduce my multiplier by 6-15 when diamonds are involved. But I could still win rounds without buying anything and just saving my $4. Interest isn't a factor now, so maybe waiting for future purchases is smarter. If I sell Gros Michel, the score would drop significantly, and keeping Supernova’s scaling is appealing. Getting Egg could help later, but selling Greedy seems too risky given my focus on scoring. It might be best to hold off on any purchases for now.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI’m considering whether to reroll, but right now, I can’t afford it, so it looks like I need to end my shopping phase. I wonder if there's any real benefit to buying Mad Joker for $4, but it doesn’t seem to fit my current strategy. So, I think it’s best to choose round_select instead. I just need to make sure to output the Action JSON with the action type set to round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
