{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nI'm in the shop trying to decide what to do with my $31. I've got some chip setups focusing on flushes and multipliers. I can't fit The Order or Mars planet cards into my strategy, and the Wrathful Joker might help if I pivot. But should I replace the Juggler for another joker, or is its hand size boost too valuable? Selling Crafty or Droll doesn't seem like a good option, though. It's a tough choice!\n**Evaluating spade strategy**\n\nI'm considering the Wrathful card, which adds +3 multipliers for each spade scored. My current suit distribution shows I have a decent number of spades, but my flushes have been mainly clubs. Still, I could build a spade flush, and if I do, Wrathful can trigger multiple times for significant multipliers. However, Even Steven also offers strong benefits with even ranks. To boost my chances, I think a Jumbo celestial pack might help me find more useful cards like Jupiter. That's probably my best investment for now!\n**Choosing card strategy**\n\nIt seems the planet names correlate with hand types: Jupiter for flush, Saturn for straight, and Mars for four of a kind. Since we're focusing on flushes, Jupiter is essential, and I might also want Earth for a full house. The next step is to buy a Jumbo celestial pack with the \"buy_booster 1\" command. I’m also considering a Blank voucher, which could lead to Antimatter later, giving me an additional joker slot. I think I should grab the Blank now to access that later!\n**Weighing purchase options**\n\nWe're at ante 6 and have a couple left, so we might have some time. Buying the Blank voucher for $10 could be worth it if it unlocks Antimatter for $20 later, giving me an additional joker slot. With $31, I can afford both Blank and a booster. It seems wise to buy Blank now for potential future benefits, even if it ends up being useless. But I need to decide if the Jumbo pack is more critical than Blank. I think I’ll go for Blank first!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI can still buy the Jumbo pack and possibly reroll, but I can only make one action right now. Buying the Blank voucher could unlock Antimatter later, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it since I might not need more joker slots. It feels like a gamble. Given that we're in the late game, focusing on scaling flushes with planets might be wiser. I think I'll buy the Jumbo pack first and consider the Blank voucher later if I have extra money. So, let’s go with buying the booster!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
