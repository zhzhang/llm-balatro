{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how adding value to Aces can be beneficial, but realizing we only have one ace left in the deck isn't ideal. The whole \"Shoot the Moon\" strategy requires holding onto queens, and luckily, there are three queens still in the deck. Maybe it could work out if we can hold onto those queens and still manage to flush as well? It feels a bit complicated, but there's potential here!\n**Considering card game strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing my options for holding cards while playing a flush. Using five cards leaves only two held, but if queens appear, I can hold them for a multiplier. That feels inconsistent and costly at $8, which isn't feasible. I'm also thinking about the Invisible Joker, which could help after two rounds. If I sell now, I could duplicate a joker later, but I'll need extra cash from selling cards like Even Steven. It feels tricky but could work!\n**Deciding strategic moves**\n\nI’ve decided to drop Even Steven because it feels less essential than Droll, Chad, and Stuntman. Juggler might help with hand size to find a flush, even if it's minor. My plan is to sell the Even Steven joker and then buy an Arcana pack for $4, but I need to do this in two separate actions due to the API limitations. Selling Even Steven first seems like a solid move, especially since I can’t buy with just $3. However, I’m weighing whether to save the money for interest instead.\n**Debating strategy for the boss fight**\n\nI think I might need to interact more with this situation. It’s a tough call on whether to keep Even Steven for the boss fight; losing it could impact my scoring ability if the boss debuffs my flush. Our main scoring comes from the flush with Droll, but I can't ignore that Even Steven adds some multiplier value for high cards. We face unknown boss effects, which could disable my strategies. Adapting might be key here, especially since I’ve seen Stuntman and Chad score high cards effectively.\n**Strategizing for the boss and card purchases**\n\nI’m considering my options for the boss fight and whether to keep Even Steven or go for purchases. It might be safer to keep Even Steven since losing it could impact my scoring ability against unknown debuffs. Selling it for an Arcana pack could be a gamble, but if I hit valuable tarot cards, it might enhance my deck significantly. My deck has 35 cards, mostly diamonds, making flushes easier. Also, I’m thinking about the order of jokers for optimal triggers during scoring. Even Steven should be prioritized for triggering effects, but selling might give me the cash needed for strategies later, especially to get the Invisible joker.\n**Considering actions for the game**\n\nI’m thinking about whether I have enough to beat the remaining blinds. Without Chad, my fallback for high cards is weaker, and losing Juggler means a smaller hand size, making it tougher to find a flush. Buying a Scholar by selling Even Steven could bring in some extra value, but with only one ace left, it doesn’t sound great. Instead, I’ll sell Even Steven to purchase an Arcana pack later. I realize I can only take one action now, so I’ll sell Even Steven for $2 as my first move.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
