{"reasoning":"**Analyzing flush scoring with jokers**\n\nI’m looking at the expected scoring for achieving a flush with the current jokers in play. Droll has a +10 multiplier with an additional x1.5 multiplier. The Even Steven card offers +4 per even card scored, while the Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card twice. The Stuntman adds a whopping +250 chips for each hand, outpacing a flush's base chips. However, fewer hands can impact flush frequency. I see potential issues with discards affecting the strategy, especially when crafting a flush.\n**Considering purchasing options**\n\nI have $11, and I could buy Wasteful for $10, which would leave me with just $1. Alternatively, I could get Stuntman for $7, leaving $4 to potentially grab Devil or Arcana or Spectral. Buying Wasteful for consistency seems smart to find flushes and cycle through scoring cards, but I wonder if it'll be enough against the ante 7/8 bosses. Stuntman directly improves chips and fits in my four joker slots. Though it reduces hand size, I can mitigate that with Juggler, keeping options open!\n**Deciding on purchases for scoring**\n\nI need to strategize to beat the game in just two antes, focusing on scoring. With ante 7 and 8, I'll need significant chips for each blind. Droll gives a x1.5 multiplier, but Stuntman adds chips directly, which seems strong. Should I opt for Wasteful instead? It could help with discards to force flushes, but Droll might become useless without them. My flush deck has plenty of spades, so maybe I should prioritize Stuntman now, planning to get Wasteful later if funds allow. But Stuntman's immediate benefits feel critical!\n**Calculating flush hand potential**\n\nI’m estimating the flush hand's base chips, which are 95, with a base multiplier of 12. Droll adds a +10 multiplier and x1.5, plus Even Steven contributes +4 for each even-ranked card, which could mean 2-3 even cards in play. Hanging Chad can retrigger the first scored card, adding to my chip total. Stuntman offers a hefty +250 chips, which gets multiplied, resulting in a significant boost of 5000-7500 extra chips per hand. I’ll definitely prioritize buying Stuntman now, which leaves me with $4 for a potential Arcana pack later!\n**Understanding joker effects and order**\n\nI need to clarify how Stuntman and Droll work together. Stuntman adds chips independently during step 5, and I think the order of independent chip jokers might not matter. Droll provides a +10 multiplier for flushes and seems to work in conjunction with the x1.5 from the polychrome edition. I realize their order can affect the total multiplier. I should apply the +10 from Droll first and then the x1.5 for a larger effect. For now, I’ll buy Stuntman and sort the order later!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
