{"reasoning":"**Considering consumable options**\n\nI’m thinking about our consumables and how we have none at the moment. We can buy an Arcana pack for $4, which could give us tarot cards like The Sun or Death. The Spectral pack is powerful but risky. The Devil is a tarot card that costs 3 and becomes a consumable. I can purchase it, but I can only use it with a target during a round. Buying may help our economy, but the immediate benefits seem small.\n**Evaluating pack purchases**\n\nIt seems like buying the Arcana Pack now could help us increase flush reliability or get a planet card. However, the Arcana only provides tarot cards, which are used immediately and don’t take up inventory. Booster packs are great for deck manipulation, adding suit conversions. Given we’re close to the end, scoring is more important than economy. We have strong chips already, like Stuntman and Droll. Duplicating a joker could be huge with the Spectral pack — notably, the Ankh duplicates one joker but destroys the others.\n**Assessing pack reliability**\n\nI’m considering \"The Soul,\" which might give a legendary card, but it’s very rare. The Spectral pack seems risky; it might offer \"Hex,\" which adds polychrome to a random joker but destroys others. That's not great either. Alternatively, there’s \"Talisman,\" which could create a joker, but \"Ectoplasm\" is worse, adding negatives. The Arcana pack feels safer. It can deliver tarot cards like \"The Hierophant\" that can be used immediately without a target. I think it’s more reliable for improving flush frequency and enhancing high-value cards.\n**Exploring strategies for flush**\n\nSince flush is my main focus and my deck has plenty of spades, I can use tarot to convert more cards to spades. For example, \"The Sun\" can convert selected cards to hearts, and \"The World\" converts to spades, which is great. So, I should consider buying the Arcana pack. We also have a Magic Trick and can buy playing cards, but there aren’t any in the shop right now. I could buy The Devil for $3 to make a gold card, but with a reduced hand size, it could be tricky to keep it at the end of the round.\n**Planning for scoring strategy**\n\nAt the end of the small blind, I might earn a few dollars and interest from leftover hands or discards, but scoring could be tricky. The default is only two discards per round, so a wasteful voucher would help. Still, I think my priority should be to survive. Buying the Arcana pack could enhance my deck and scoring opportunities. I’ll buy the Arcana Pack for $4, which uses my entire budget but sets me up for choosing tarot cards. It's important to confirm we have capacity for consumables, but booster packs are used immediately and don't require capacity.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
