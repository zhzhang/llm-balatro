{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop purchases**\n\nI'm at Ante 7, and I need to prepare for the next small blind. I have $9, and I'm considering my options: buying tarot cards like The Devil, or jokers like Stuntman or Golden Ticket. The boosters are another choice, but I can’t afford the voucher. My current build focuses on building a flush. If I buy Stuntman, I must sell a joker, and while it adds chips, it reduces hand size. That could impact my flush strategy!\n**Analyzing chip requirements**\n\nAt ante 7, the chip requirements are increasing, and I'm considering how to gain those +250 chips per hand. It looks like this addition will be flat, but it’s significant because it multiplies with my total. In my current scoring, if I can hit a flush, that’s already a strong base of chips to build on. The Stuntman adds substantial chips, but losing hand size could affect my ability to build a flush consistently. Meanwhile, I'm weighing the benefits of Golden Ticket and The Devil for potential gold cards and rewards!\n**Clarifying card details**\n\nI realize that the gold card's enhancement provides $3 if held in hand at the end of the round. The Golden Ticket states it earns $3 when held, but that feels odd since jokers typically aren't held. I think that description might actually belong to The Devil tarot card instead. In Balatro, Golden Ticket gives $4 when scoring a gold card. It seems the secondary description for the Golden Ticket may be misformatted, so I need to ignore it for now!\n**Deciding on joker sales**\n\nI need to focus on scoring more efficiently to beat ante 7 and 8. The Stuntman seems like a strong option, but I have to decide which joker to sell. Should it be Even Steven or Scary Face? Even Steven boosts the multiplier for even cards, while Scary Face provides chips for face cards. The Droll Joker is key for my strategy, and I have Juggler to maintain hand size for a flush. Maybe I should sell Scary Face, since it only helps with face cards, which aren't always in my flush.\n**Planning joker sales and purchases**\n\nI'm evaluating how to optimize my strategy for the ante. I need more scoring power, especially since Even Steven and Scary Face have different strengths. Since I want to maintain my chip counts and maximize multipliers, I think selling Scary Face makes sense to make room for Stuntman. Scary Face adds chips but is less consistent for my flush strategy. After selling, I might also have enough to buy the Wasteful voucher, which could help with discards! The plan is to sell Scary Face first!\n**Choosing actions for ante 7**\n\nWe're at ante 7, and I feel like I need to scale up my strategy. I want to go for Stuntman, which means I have to sell Scary Face first. That would leave me with $4 after the sale. I could either buy Stuntman or consider getting the Arcana or Spectral pack for upgrades. While Wasteful is tempting for additional discards, I think Stuntman offers better chip scaling long-term. The first action has to be selling Scary Face!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
