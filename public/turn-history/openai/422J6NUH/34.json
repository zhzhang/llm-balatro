{"reasoning":"**Evaluating hand counts in Supernova**\n\nI’m considering how Supernova counts the number of times a poker hand has been played, specifically during a run. It seems to trigger when scoring, using the count from the current hand too. I'm thinking it likely increments after the hand is counted. Greedy gives a multiplier for diamonds scored — with a diamond flush yielding a +15 multiplier, whereas a heart flush doesn’t provide that bonus. Based on the deck counts, we have 1 diamond, 4 hearts, 2 spades, and 1 club.\n**Evaluating card strategy for flushes**\n\nMy best plan might be to discard cards that won't help form a diamond flush. I need 5 cards of the same suit for a flush. Currently, I have 4 hearts and just need one more to complete a hearts flush, so I should discard non-hearts like Ace of spades, 6 of spades, 9 of clubs, and 9 of diamonds while drawing 4 new cards. I estimate there’s about a 51% chance of getting at least one heart from 44 remaining cards. Alternatively, aiming for a diamond flush seems trickier — I only have 1 diamond so keeping it while discarding others doesn't make sense.\n**Considering card discards for flushes**\n\nI'm pondering whether to discard all non-diamonds, except maybe keeping a steel heart for flexibility in my hand. However, to create a diamond flush, I'd need to draw 4 diamonds while keeping the 9D. If I keep 9D and a steel heart, I can only discard 5 cards, making it tricky since all 5 must be the same suit for a flush. The best sequence would be to maximize diamond pulls while retaining 9D. But, discarding all hearts means I lose the chance for a hearts flush, which could already meet my goal!\n**Strategizing flush play**\n\nI'm reflecting on my past flush score of 4032 with ante 2 while using the same jokers. Now, with ante 3, I need at least 4000 points, but I believe a heart flush could still get me there. Since I need to play 5 cards, if I opt for a heart flush, I’ll have to decide about the steel heart, which is a 3 of hearts. I could use it in the flush or hold onto it for a 1.5x multiplier. Keeping it in my hand for the multiplier might be wiser since it stacks well with Droll's multiplier. Right now, I have 10H, 9H, and 5H, plus the steel heart, but I still need a couple more hearts to complete the flush.\n**Planning card discards for a flush**\n\nI need 2 more hearts to complete a flush, or I could use the steel heart as one of the five. If I play it, I might miss out on the x1.5 multiplier, but I could still aim for over 4000 points. Playing the steel heart might give around 4428 points when factoring in potential draws. If I don’t draw hearts, I could aim for a three of a kind. The best plan is to discard non-hearts — I'll discard the Ace and 6 of spades, along with the two nines, which keeps my heart count intact. I’ll draw 4 new cards and hope for at least one heart!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
