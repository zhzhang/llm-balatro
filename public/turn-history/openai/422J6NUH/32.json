{"reasoning":"**Arranging multipliers for efficiency**\n\nI’m analyzing the polychrome on the joker, which offers a 1.5 multiplier after its effect. As a joker card, it triggers at step 5. It seems wise to position multiplicative jokers last, so they apply after any additive boosts. So, the optimal order might be Greedy first, followed by Supernova, and then Droll to maximize that x1.5 multiplier. I’m still figuring out how Crafty and chips fit into this arrangement, but it might be fine to separate those.\n**Optimizing the action order**\n\nI’m figuring out the best arrangement for my multipliers, which I think should be Greedy, Supernova, Crafty, and Droll. Although Greedy is on-scored, it’s important for the list. I’m considering whether to spend an action to rearrange before the boss. It wouldn’t consume resources besides a turn, but it might lead to longer play this round. If we don’t rearrange, we could score suboptimally since Supernova needs to trigger before Droll to maximize that x1.5 boost.\n**Deciding on joker arrangement**\n\nI’m considering Droll's +10 multiplier, and if Droll is last, that +10 would multiply itself. Actually, the x1.5 boosts after any previous totals when inside. So, it makes sense that we should rearrange. The next action should be to align the jokers in the optimal order. Right now, the indices are [Greedy, Crafty, Droll, Supernova]. For maximizing multipliers, I want Greedy first, then Supernova, and finally Droll. Crafty can go anywhere since it adds chips, leading me to [Greedy, Crafty, Supernova, Droll].\n**Planning joker rearrangement**\n\nI’m deciding to go ahead with rearranging the jokers to the order of 1, 2, 4, 3. It’s straightforward since I don't need to worry about estimated chips or hand type for now. I just need to focus on the action itself. So, I’ll prepare the action in JSON format and make sure everything is ready for this next step. This should set us up nicely for the upcoming play!\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,3]"}
