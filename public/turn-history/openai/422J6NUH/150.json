{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card play strategy**\n\nI’m considering playing A♥ J♥ 8♥ along with two new hearts, while keeping 6♥ unplayed to enhance my multiplier. Since I have a hand size of 7, I think I can discard 9♣ Q♦ 7♦ to chase after the hearts. I could also play a straight from 6-7-8-9-J, but that doesn’t seem as strong as the flush with Droll. I’m also thinking about the order of jokers, as their independence and scoring impact my strategy. It’s definitely a lot to juggle!\n**Clarifying joker effects**\n\nI’m thinking about how jokers and their editions impact the game, especially in left-to-right order. It seems that Droll doesn’t affect Stuntman’s chip addition which is additive, rather than multiplicative. Since chips and multipliers are computed separately, I wonder if the order matters. It looks like the independent effects happen sequentially, affecting different variables. In this case, it makes sense to discard indices 5, 6, and 7, and then draw 3 cards. Such a tricky balance!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7]"}
