{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Ancient Joker advantages**\n\nThe Ancient Joker provides a powerful x1.5 multiplier for each played card of a suit, starting with clubs. If all five cards played are of that suit, the multiplier becomes significant at 7.59. However, since the suit changes every round, we need to strategize by discarding to adapt. In early ante rounds, the Ancient Joker offers excellent scaling opportunities, especially if we can play suited hands. It seems to be a stronger long-term option compared to Blackboard, but I’m considering if a booster pack might be better.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI realized that 6 + 4 equals 10, which isn't enough. I could buy Blackboard and save money, or I could go for Jumbo Celestial for $6 and still have $3 left. Planets can boost hand types like Full House, increasing base chips and multipliers, but that's more of a long-term strategy. However, buying the Ancient Joker seems like the best option right now. I also considered a reroll, but at $5, that's not worth it. So, the action is to buy the Ancient Joker in position 2.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
