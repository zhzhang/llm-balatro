{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI'm considering my options in the shop without cards. I can buy a standard pack for 4, but that will increase my debt to -10, possibly improving my deck, though it's uncertain. The director's cut costs 10, pushing my debt to -16, which could be crucial for the boss fight, but I can't reroll the boss right now. Using the voucher allows a reroll but at a high cost. I think it’s best to play the rounds to earn money and conserve my purchases for now.\n**Arranging card placements**\n\nI’m certain that Smiley should be placed before Ancient in the order since Ancient has a multiplicative effect that works best when applied after additive ones. Smeared doesn’t trigger, so its position doesn’t matter. I’m considering if I should sell the basic Joker to reduce debt, but that would mean losing a +4 multiplier, which isn't ideal. Smiley and Ancient are really strong, while the credit card allows for more debt. It seems like my next step should be to select a round and weigh my options carefully.\n**Making a decision**\n\nI’ve decided it’s better to keep things as they are for now. Now, I think my next step is to proceed with round_select. I want to make sure I choose wisely and gather more information before making any further changes. It's crucial to weigh my options, so I’ll stay focused on what happens during this round and see how it affects my situation moving forward.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
