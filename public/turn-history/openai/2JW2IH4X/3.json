{"reasoning":"**Calculating money and rewards**\n\nI'm considering whether we should save money for a shopping voucher instead of buying things now. It looks like we need to estimate our chips for the game: if we play big blind, we need 450 chips. I'll calculate how much we might earn from winning rounds, and how interest works with our total at the end of the round. I think if we start with 9 chips and manage the rounds well, we could finish around 17.\n**Evaluating strategy for vouchers**\n\nI'm thinking about how much we need to save to buy a $10 voucher after playing big blind. If we skip buying now, our money could double to 18, but we won't be able to buy the voucher before facing the boss. That voucher is important since it gives an extra hand each round. I believe the best option could be to play big blind first and then buy the voucher. There's also the possibility of buying Drunkard for $4 now to boost our strategy, leaving enough to possibly buy Grabber later!\n**Analyzing purchase options**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy the buffoon pack for $4, but if I do, I might not have enough for the voucher later. If I only get Drunkard, I can save money for the voucher after the big blind. Another strategy could be to buy the buffoon pack and skip the big blind to preserve funds, but that doesn't seem like a solid plan. Buying Drunkard now while keeping enough money for future purchases, like Grabber, seems to be the best approach! Alternatively, I could also buy Hierophant for $3 and still have a viable path to get the voucher later.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm trying to choose between options. Drunkard looks appealing since the boss discards cards each hand played. Wait, the boss actually discards 2 random cards from your hand, which makes saving cards harder. Still, Drunkard could help later. Hierophant seems good too since it gives a permanent bonus to two cards, increasing chips. The buffoon pack is a gamble, but scoring a joker early could help a lot. Ultimately, if I buy the celestial pack for 4, I might still afford the voucher later!\n**Choosing the celestial or buffoon pack**\n\nI'm considering buying a pack, and the celestial pack levels up a hand type immediately, which could be really helpful. For example, I could choose the Full House planet, Earth. But I'm unsure about the options in the buffoon pack. While the celestial pack seems strong early, the buffoon pack has its merits too, especially with the potential for jokers. Since I can buy either and still have enough for the voucher later, I'm leaning towards the buffoon pack as my priority. I'll go ahead and buy the buffoon pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
