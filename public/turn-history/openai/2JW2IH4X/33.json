{"reasoning":"**Analyzing scoring order**\n\nI'm considering the order of actions for scoring in the game. Clever adds chips before multipliers, which is important because the final chips depend on that order. \n\nGenerally, the independent order doesn't matter between chips and multipliers, but things get tricky when actions start to multiply chips or multipliers. In the case of different joker effects, the order might not affect outcomes if they act separately. However, when it comes to scoring, the interactions could change things, especially with specific triggers in play.\n**Considering scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm thinking about how to approach scoring within the game. When we start with the base multiplier for each card, we add chips, apply enhancements like jokers, and see how they affect current chips and multipliers. \n\nInterestingly, if Ancient multiplies the multiplier and Odd Todd adds chips, the order remains irrelevant since they target different aspects. This gives me some peace of mind! With Turtle Bean increasing hand size, we have more options to build heart hands, leading me to the action of proceeding with round selection.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
