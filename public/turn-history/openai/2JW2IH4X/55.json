{"reasoning":"**Evaluating next action**\n\nI'm at the shop with $6, and I have 4 jokers plus one slot open. Buying the Smiley Face for $4 sounds like a solid move, especially since it synergizes with face cards (J, Q, K), giving a nice +5 multiplier when scored. The Ancient Joker also gives a multiplier based on heart-suited cards, which could work well since it seems to stack nicely with the Smiley's effect. So, I think going for the Smiley is smart for maximizing points!\n**Considering card arrangement**\n\nArrangement is definitely key here. If I place the Smiley before the Ancient Joker, it gives a +5 multiplier which then gets multiplied by 1.5 for heart face cards—effectively raising it to +7.5. That makes it a stronger choice when the card is both a face and the target suit. I'll go ahead and buy the Smiley for $4, leaving me with $2. I could think about getting an Arcana pack later, but for now, focusing on this setup seems wise!\n**Clarifying joker mechanics**\n\nSo, it seems the Blue Joker works independently, giving chips rather than affecting the score directly. The Clever Joker also appears to operate independently and provides +80 chips with a two-pair hand, which activates separately. The order of independent jokers matters less unless we consider additive versus multiplicative effects. My goal is to have Smiley before Ancient, since Smiley offers additive boosts while Ancient is for multiplicative effects. I’ll buy the card now, rearranging as I go!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
