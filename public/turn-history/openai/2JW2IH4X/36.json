{"reasoning":"**Evaluating queen synergy**\n\nI’m considering how the \"Shoot the Moon\" mechanic works, where each Queen in hand gives a +13 multiplier. We don’t have strong queen synergy, but keeping a large hand size with cards like Turtle Bean can help, especially if we hold onto the queens. Our deck has around three queens left out of 39, so the probability is moderate. Managing to hold two or three queens could yield a substantial multiplier, but we have to decide if selling a Joker for it would be worthwhile.\n**Deciding on cosmic purchases**\n\nI’m thinking about whether we should buy celestial packs using the Telescope to get the planet that boosts our most played hand, Two Pair. Each pack is $4, while we only have $6, so if I buy one pack, I can’t afford Earth. For optimal value, leveling up Two Pair seems more crucial, so I’d be getting the planet associated with it. I think that’s Venus for Two Pair and could improve our multiplier and chip count, which is great! Alternatively, I could buy Earth, which would enhance the Full House instead.\n**Pondering strategic adjustments**\n\nI’m realizing that we don’t often play Full Houses compared to Two Pairs (2 times vs. 4 for Two Pair), so I could pivot my strategy. Ancient currently favors clubs, while Odd Todd prefers odd ranks, which makes weird combinations interesting. I think focusing on leveling Two Pair might scale better for us. However, considering \"Shoot the Moon,\" I wonder if restructuring around queens is worth selling a basic Joker. Maybe buying a Celestial pack for $4 to level Two Pair is the best move, as it directly supports our upgrades.\n**Evaluating the next steps**\n\nI’m considering whether to reroll, but $5 feels too high. Instead, I’ll buy Booster Celestial Pack #1. Since the command requires just one action, that seems straightforward. The celestial pack costs $4, which means we can only buy one with our $6. After that, I'll need to pick a planet, and the telescope guarantees that we’ll get the Two Pair planet, which is excellent for boosting our scoring. It might seem cheaper to buy Earth at $3, but I’m leaning towards the celestial pack for its potential.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
