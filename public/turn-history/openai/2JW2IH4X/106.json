{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot card choices**\n\nI'm working with a tarot pack where I’ve already chosen the Fool card, which relates to the planet Uranus in consumables. Now, I need to select a second card from the remaining options: Empress, High Priestess, Hierophant, or Hermit. Each card offers different enhancements, like the Empress boosting my scores or the Hierophant providing bonus chips. With my goal of maximizing multipliers, choosing the right card is essential for my strategy moving forward.\n**Enhancing face card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about enhancing face cards because Smiley works well with them, especially in scoring situations like two pairs, full houses, or flushes. My current hand shows an Ace of hearts, King of hearts, Queen of spades, and small spades and diamonds. I'm realizing the Ace isn't a face card—only the King and Queen are. Considering suit synergy, I might focus on the King and Queen. There’s also a twist with Ancient, which affects scoring based on suits, particularly if Hearts can count as Diamonds!\n**Choosing card enhancements**\n\nI'm realizing that for Ancient, Hearts and Diamonds count as the same suit, so boosting hearts is beneficial. The King of hearts is an obvious choice, but I’m also considering the Ace—while it doesn’t activate Smiley, it gets a nice x1.5 from Ancient. Upgrading hearts and diamonds could help with flushes due to the smeared effect. I'm leaning toward selecting the Empress on the King and Queen, since the Queen is a face card. So, I’ll select the Ace and King of hearts.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,4,5]"}
