{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker sale and arrangement**\n\nI'm in a shop with no money to buy anything right now. I could sell some jokers, like Odd Todd, Ancient Joker, and basic Joker, but they might not be worth it. Selling them could give me $1-$4, but I'd lose their strength. I need to move to the next blind, so I’ll check if rearranging the jokers is beneficial since their order affects scoring. Each joker impacts multipliers differently when scored, which I need to consider.\n**Analyzing chip and multiplier effects**\n\nI’m trying to understand how Odd Todd adds chips and if the order matters for scoring. Chips are added first, then modifiers, and scoring happens from left to right. If Odd Todd comes before Ancient Joker, it adds chips before the multiplier kicks in. The global multiplier affects the total hand’s chips, but since chips and multipliers are separate, I think the order won’t ultimately change the final score if they're independent. However, some jokers can tie multipliers to chip values, which adds a bit of nuance.\n**Finalizing actions with jokers**\n\nI’m looking at how Ancient Joker multiplies the multiplier and Odd Todd adds chips. Since multiplying the multiplier is commutative, it won’t matter when I do it—my end result will be the same. Adding chips is also independent of the order. However, if Ancient Joker triggers a multiplier based on spade cards scored, that might affect things. But it seems the order among the cards still doesn't change anything, so I don’t need to rearrange. The next step will be to move on to round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
