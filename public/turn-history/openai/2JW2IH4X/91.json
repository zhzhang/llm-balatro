{"reasoning":"**Evaluating planet selection**\n\nWe're working with PLANET_PACK now that Uranus has been selected. Initially, there were five choices, but after selecting Uranus, we have four left. I need to decide whether to select another planet card or skip. Our current build is a Two Pair, now at level 6. I have several options to consider: Earth for a Full House, Saturn for a Straight, Mercury for a Pair, or Mars for Four of a Kind. While we can't choose again, I'm thinking about what complements our build and helps us raise our potential for the higher blind.\n**Deciding on planet selection**\n\nI'm realizing that choosing a Straight is harder, while a Pair seems unhelpful. Four of a Kind is tough without deck manipulation, so I decide to go with Earth. I’m a bit confused about how planet cards work—are they consumables right away or do they go into my inventory? It looks like in this setup, selecting a planet card adds it to consumables immediately. After selecting Uranus, my Two Pair level increased, confirming it applies instantly. Selecting Earth will help level up my Full House too!\n**Selecting Earth**\n\nI'm ready to make a choice, and I'm going with Earth! It seems like the best option right now to level up my gameplay. I feel confident that this selection will enhance my strategy. Now I just need to make sure everything is set up correctly for the next moves. Let’s see how this plays out once I apply this planet card! It's exciting to think about the possibilities!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
