{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nIn the early game, skipping smaller bets to accumulate money can be beneficial, especially if the tag gives you $5. Then, you can jump straight to the big blind with a manageable starting deck. Skipping the economy tag on the big blind could double money up to 40, which is powerful. However, I wonder if skipping the big blind for the economy tag would leave me under-equipped for the boss. I could still potentially win with some decent hands to reach 600 chips.\n**Evaluating boss mechanics**\n\nThe boss discards 2 random cards each time I play a hand, which reduces my hand size with each round. Starting with an ante of 1, I think I can play about 4 or maybe 5 hands, but in Balatro’s default setting, it’s typically 4 hands with 3 discards. I'm unsure about the specifics—maybe it's actually 4 hands and 2 discards to start. Discarding 2 random cards each play is manageable, but it does impact my future draws.\n**Analyzing playing strategy**\n\nIt seems like playing the small blind first to earn $3 before shopping could be beneficial. After winning each blind, I get the chance to shop, allowing me to buy my first joker, which is crucial for scaling. If I skip the small blind, I miss that early shop opportunity. However, skipping could yield $5, pushing me to $9 without getting the shop until after the big play. I wonder if playing small first and then purchasing a joker might let me still have the option to skip the big blind later for the economy tag.\n**Deciding on gameplay**\n\nOkay, I need to remember that my decisions are made during the blind selection phase. After shopping, I'd move to the big blind with my new cash and jokers. If I choose to skip the big blind, I won't have the chance to shop before facing the boss. Playing small first gives me access to at least one shop to buy jokers or consumables, which will definitely help against the boss. So, my plan is to play the round for small!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
