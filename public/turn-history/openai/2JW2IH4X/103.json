{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop actions**\n\nI need to make a decision about my next move in the shop. Currently, I have a negative balance of -8 but can go to -20 if I use a credit card. I have some items to consider: Cloud 9 for 7, Mega Arcana for 8, and Director's Cut for 10. Since I have 5 jokers already, I can't buy Cloud 9 without selling one. I need to evaluate if selling either Misprint or Smiley is worthwhile.\n**Considering strategies for the boss**\n\nWith my current items, I believe I can defeat the boss. However, Cloud 9 won’t contribute to scoring. Mega Arcana could provide a tarot card that buffs my deck, like Death or Strength, but it costs 8, leading me to -16. It’s risky, but it doesn’t consume a joker slot. Director's Cut costs too much, and I can't reroll the boss right now. Rearranging the jokers is important; their order matters for triggering effects. I think placing Smiley first and then Ancient could be the best strategy.\n**Arranging my cards for maximum effect**\n\nFor the diamond face card, I’ve realized that if Smiley triggers first to add 5, then Ancient will multiply by 1.5, making that combination better than the other way around. I definitely need to place Smiley before Ancient. As for the Credit Card and Misprint, they're independent with Credit Card providing +10 Mult and Misprint offering a random add. I think I want my order to be Smeared, Smiley, Ancient, Misprint, and Credit Card, but since Smeared is passive, I guess its order doesn’t really matter.\n**Understanding scoring and card effects**\n\nI've come to realize that for scoring, only Smiley and Ancient are on-scored, while Misprint and Credit Card are independent. The on-scored jokers affect the multiplier during the card scoring phase. After all the cards are scored, independent jokers add their effects. It seems like the base multiplier is modified step by step. Since Ancient multiplies the total before independent jokers come into play, I should place the independent jokers after any additive effects. I think Misprint likely adds a multiplier too. The Credit Card has its own +10 multiplier and possibly another from the holo edition.\n**Contemplating purchases and strategy**\n\nThe Credit Card has a secondary description of +10 multiplier, and the holographic edition gives another +10, making it a total of +20. This effect could potentially stack with others, but order only matters if there's an independent x-mult. Since I have no purchases yet, I could buy Mega Arcana for 8, pushing me to -16, which may be worth it for the tarots that enhance my deck. But there's a risk of drawing less useful cards. Given my focus on flushes and two pairs, I might buy Mega Arcana to improve my deck, but I’m still concerned about going deeper into debt with future boss encounters. Ultimately, I think purchasing Director's Cut might be more strategic since it could help mitigate the worst effects of the bosses I might face.\n**Deciding on actions and joker arrangement**\n\nI need to think through rerolling; it requires spending $10, and at -18, I wouldn’t be able to afford it. I can only spend down to -20, so I shouldn't buy the voucher yet. My best options now are either Mega Arcana or preserving funds for a future reroll. Currently, I'm at -8, and I could gain money after the boss round.\n\nI’ll rearrange my jokers for optimal scoring: I think I'll place Smeared first, then Smiley, followed by Ancient. Since Misprint is independent, its order with Credit Card doesn’t matter much. I’ll set the order as Smeared, Smiley, Ancient, Credit, and Misprint.\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [4,1,2,5,3]"}
