{"reasoning":"**Estimating scoring potential**\n\nI'm looking at the current scoring, which is modest. My biggest score is 688 from the last round, but with a +4 multiplier and two pairs, there's potential to hit 1200 in a single hand! First, I need to clarify the scoring for two pairs, which is 20 chips, and then understand how card values add up. \n\nFace cards typically have standard values, but odd ranks can add bonuses. I'm making sense of the multipliers and the current spade suit. It seems like skipping the small blind doesn’t change the suit. That’s good!\n**Understanding scoring multipliers**\n\nFor any spade card, the multiplier gets a boost of x1.5 when scored. If I play multiple spades, the multiplier increases significantly. For example, playing 5 spades would give me a multiplier of x1.5 raised to the power of 5, resulting in a big value. \n\nThe base multiplier for two pairs is 2, plus there's the Joker that adds an additional +4 at an independent stage after scoring. So the final formula combines the base multiplier, spades, and any extras. If there are 4 or 5 spades, the final multipliers and chip bonuses add up considerably!\n**Maximizing scoring combinations**\n\nIt looks like if my hand contains two pairs, I could get an independent boost of +80 chips. These chips would be multiplied by my final score. For two pairs, I assume I need four cards, with a fifth being irrelevant for scoring. I want to maximize my scoring cards with spades and odd ranks. \n\nIf I go for pairs like 9s and 5s, I can't pair cards of the same suit multiple times. So, I can have two spades in scored cards while including spade kickers, but only scored cards count for multipliers.\n**Planning for full house and flushes**\n\nFor a full house, I'm looking at needing 5 cards, which means I can include more spades. For a three-of-a-kind, I can only have one spade, but for a straight or flush, I could play with 5 spades! The Ancient multiplier is especially powerful for flushes or straight flushes, so I should aim for a flush when spades are involved. \n\nWith 5 spades, my base multiplier would be 4, and after the Ancient multiplier, it could go up significantly. If I include odd ranks, that could add a lot of chips to my total. Overall, focusing on spade flushes or straight flushes looks promising!\n**Evaluating the suit change and strategy**\n\nIf the Ancient changes to diamonds at the end of the big blind, it would be disastrous since diamond cards receive debuffs. This means they could lose their chip value and abilities, impacting my strategy against the boss. Debuffed cards technically still contribute to the hand but don't trigger joker effects. \n\nSo, if Ancient becomes diamonds, I could lose its main multiplier. I’m weighing the option to skip the big blind to keep playing spades, gaining an Uncommon Tag instead, but it would also mean missing out on potential rewards. I need to be strategic as I evaluate risks and benefits, especially looking for reliable points to achieve the required chips to beat the boss.\n**Weighing options before boss battle**\n\nIf I want to avoid a suit change before facing the boss, I might choose to skip the big blind. This way, I can open slots for potential new jokers, triggering Riff-raff right before the boss selection. Skipping means I automatically move to the boss's blind selection after getting an Uncommon Tag, but I’d miss out on shopping beforehand. While skipping offers benefits, I weigh the risk of the Ancient suit changing to diamonds, which would debuff it. Ultimately, I need to decide if I’ll play or skip the big blind to set myself up for the best chance against the boss.\n**Evaluating options for the boss fight**\n\nI’m weighing whether to skip the big blind to keep spades for the boss, which seems low-risk, or play it for potential money and a shop. Skipping gives me an Uncommon Tag but I lose the chance to earn $4 and shop before facing the boss. However, it allows me to keep my power intact with the Ancient spades. I think maximizing my tags and jokers by skipping is beneficial given my current setup. Selling a joker for cash could open room for Riff-raff, but I need to ensure I have slots available for the next boss selection. It's a balancing act between immediate gains and preparing for the boss.\n**Analyzing strategy for boss encounter**\n\nI’m debating whether to skip the big blind, which might help us keep our jokers intact and still face the boss effectively. Skipping gives me an Uncommon Tag, but I worry that if I do, I won’t have room to generate jokers through Riff-raff later. I could sell a joker now to create space, but I also think it makes sense to keep Riff-raff active for potential new jokers. Ultimately, playing the big blind could earn me money and possibly enable purchases that help without risking a suit change before the boss fight.\n**Evaluating options for boss encounter**\n\nI’m weighing whether to skip the big blind or play it. Skipping might give me a strong Tag, but I could also face the boss without the advantage of buying items in the shop first. If I play big and Ancient turns into diamonds, I can still use other jokers effectively. The likelihood is that I might still win against the boss across multiple hands, if needed. Therefore, playing big seems like the best approach for gaining resources, even with the risk of suit changes.\n**Deciding on big blind strategy**\n\nI'm leaning towards playing big rather than skipping. While the Uncommon tag offers a free joker, I might lose valuable pre-boss money and shop access if I skip. Playing big gives me $4, and with some basic selling, I could buy something useful. Even if Ancient becomes diamonds, I could still score well, especially with leftover hands after the boss.\n\nIf I skip, it will lead to no immediate rewards, but I can still keep some strategic options open. After weighing everything, I think playing big would be beneficial for building my resources.\n**Choosing to skip big round**\n\nI think skipping big is a reasonable choice, especially if I plan to sell some jokers after the boss to make room for the free uncommon. That's a solid plan! I’ll take action and skip the round. \n\nRegarding riff-raff, if I skip big while I'm full, I wonder if it will still trigger its effect when blind is selected. Since it says “when blind is selected,” I believe it does still apply. \n\nI’ll output the action JSON accordingly!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
