{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m in a shop with a -16 balance on my credit card. I can't buy anything unless my card allows me to go to -20. For example, a Cloud 9 costs 7, which would take me to -23, and that’s not allowed. The Director's Cut at 10 and Reroll at 5 would also push me below the limit. I suppose I could sell a joker to gain some money, likely Misprint since it’s not very useful, but I wonder if it has some worth after all!\n**Evaluating finances and purchases**\n\nMy credit card provides a +10 multiplier and a debt option, which I should keep. I’m considering selling Misprint to improve my finances and open up future buys. With a -16 balance, selling it for 2 would only get me to -14, and I still wouldn't be able to purchase Cloud 9 for 7. To buy it, I need to be at least -13. If I sell Smiley and Misprint, I’d get to -12, but am I sure Cloud 9 is worth it? It sounds iffy for my strategy!\n**Considering game strategy**\n\nI’m thinking it might be better not to sell anything and just select the next round to play. I could earn money by winning and accumulating interest, but having a negative balance means I can't earn interest. The end of the round will give me money based on how many hands I have remaining, which could help me climb out of debt. I also need to keep my jokers for potential wins. Rearranging their order for scoring is crucial, with Ancient and Smiley each offering different multipliers. If both trigger, their order matters!\n**Deciding joker order**\n\nI want Smiley to trigger before Ancient so the multiplicative effects can add up. The credit card's +10 multiplier is independent, similar to Misprint, and Smeared is passive. Smiley activates on face cards, while Ancient triggers on diamonds, so it makes sense to arrange them as Smiley first, then Ancient. My current order is Smeared, Smiley, Ancient, Misprint, and Credit Card, which feels solid. I think it’s time to select the next round—so I’ll output JSON with action set to round_select!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
