Then, you can jump straight to the big blind with a manageable starting deck. Skipping the economy tag on the big blind could double money up to 40, which is powerful. However, I wonder if skipping the big blind for the economy tag would leave me under-equipped for the boss. I could still potentially win with some decent hands to reach 600 chips.\\n**Evaluating boss mechanics**\\n\\nThe boss discards 2 random cards each time I play a hand, which reduces my hand size with each round. Starting with an ante of 1, I think I can play about 4 or maybe 5 hands, but in Balatro\\u2019s default setting, it\\u2019s typically 4 hands with 3 discards. I'm unsure about the specifics\\u2014maybe it's actually 4 hands and 2 discards to start. Discarding 2 random cards each play is manageable, but it does impact my future draws.\\n**Analyzing playing strategy**\\n\\nIt seems like playing the small blind first to earn $3 before shopping could be beneficial. After winning each blind, I get the chance to shop, allowing me to buy my first joker, which is crucial for scaling. If I skip the small blind, I miss that early shop opportunity. However, skipping could yield $5, pushing me to $9 without getting the shop until after the big play. I wonder if playing small first and then purchasing a joker might let me still have the option to skip the big blind later for the economy tag.\\n**Deciding on gameplay**\\n\\nOkay, I need to remember that my decisions are made during the blind selection phase. After shopping, I'd move to the big blind with my new cash and jokers. If I choose to skip the big blind, I won't have the chance to shop before facing the boss. Playing small first gives me access to at least one shop to buy jokers or consumables, which will definitely help against the boss. So, my plan is to play the round for small!\\n\\nCommand: play_round\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 2]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: King of Hearts.

If I play five cards, I need a low kicker that doesn't impact my chips, like the 2\\u2663. However, if that kicker isn\\u2019t part of the hand, it won\\u2019t contribute chips. Since I have 8 cards total, I need to pick 5 and keep some hearts for a potential flush later, but I only have 4 hearts. I might also think about going for a full house or three-of-a-kind instead.\\n**Calculating flush probabilities**\\n\\nFor a flush, all 5 cards contribute to the hand's value, and each card adds chips. For instance, if I have 5 hearts with decent ranks, I could get a base of 35 plus the sum of the ranks multiplied by 4. A flush could potentially beat a blind in one hand!\\n\\nNow, I already have 4 hearts, so if I discard non-heart cards and draw new ones, my hand size is 8, and I need one more heart to complete the flush. There are 9 hearts left in a deck of 44 cards, making my chances fairly good! After each hand, I can draw to refill my cards.\\n**Deciding on card strategy**\\n\\nI'm weighing my options: I could discard some non-hearts to try to get a heart for a flush, but playing a solid two pair seems like a safer bet that won\\u2019t waste my discard. The flush could definitely be better, but it\\u2019s not absolutely necessary. Reaching 300 chips might require three hands, but I only have four in total. \\n\\nPlaying two pair now sounds like a good plan. After that, I'll still have three hands left to maximize my winnings. I\\u2019d ideally like to clear the blind in two hands, so if I can make 120 in the first hand, I'll need 180 in the second. That\\u2019s similar to the flush goal, or even three-of-a-kind, which has its own benefits with a base multiplier.\\n**Analyzing hand possibilities**\\n\\nI'm considering making a three-of-a-kind with tens. I need one more 10 from the deck, and there are indeed 2 tens remaining. In my hand, I already have two 10s and two Jacks. For a three-of-a-kind, if I get that missing ten, the score would be a base of 30 plus the 10s gives me 90, multiplied by 3 for 270. \\n\\nHowever, it looks like that might not be enough. For Jacks, it would be similar, but a four-of-a-kind with 10s or Jacks would yield even more chips. Comparing this with a flush, the potential score could be higher at around 300, depending on the sum of the chips. A straight could also work, needing five cards to maximize my score.\\n**Weighing hands and strategies**\\n\\nTo clear in two hands, my second hand needs to be strong\\u2014either a flush, straight, or high two pair. A flush would give a solid score since I'd need chips from five hearts. I'm considering discarding three non-heart cards to increase my chances of getting a flush, which would yield around 300 chips if everything goes well. \\n\\nCalculating chip values shows that even a flush with lower-ranking cards might still fall short of 300 chips. Therefore, it might be better to aim for two pair instead now and set up the second hand for three-of-a-kind or something higher. Playing strategically with my pairs now will help preserve my potential for winning money in future hands.\\n**Considering optimal hands**\\n\\nI'm thinking about my best options for playing two pairs. If I use 2\\u2665 2\\u2663 10\\u2665 10\\u2666 and J\\u2666, I get a base of 20 plus the chip values for a total of 44, leading to 88 chips when multiplied. But, actually, using Jacks as my pair would give me more value because they have higher chip values. \\n\\nIf I can draw another Jack or 10 while keeping my pairs, that could work. I could discard some hearts, like K\\u2665 and 5\\u2665, while keeping 10\\u2665 for the pair. The probability of drawing at least one Jack or 10 from the remaining deck isn\\u2019t great, and might only yield about 32.5%. \\n\\nSo, it seems like playing my immediate best hand\\u2014two pair J and 10\\u2014would be the most straightforward option. I'll adjust my plan based on that and estimate chips for the hand to be around 120. Now I\\u2019ll prepare a JSON action for that.\\n\\nCommand: play 2 5 7 8 6 two pair 120\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 5 of Spades.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers.

You may play up to 5 cards at a time.

Use the results of previous hands played to inform your estimate.\\ndiscard <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Discard the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may discard up to 5 cards at a time.\\nrearrange_hand <card1> <card2> ... <cardN> - Rearrange the hand of cards.
