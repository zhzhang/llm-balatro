{"reasoning":"**Considering joker slots and strategy**\n\nI need to manage the number of jokers I have since I'm currently at four and can hold a maximum of five. To buy more, I could sell one for $2. My choice would be to sell Blue. While losing +104 chips might sting, the multiplier gains from scoring could be significant. Blue's effectiveness scales with the deck size, which is currently 52 cards. However, I could also consider keeping Blue and just buying a standard pack for $4 to expand my deck.\n**Deciding on card purchases and actions**\n\nI’m thinking about buying a strong card from a standard pack, especially since Smeared might disappear after I leave the shop. Selling Blue seems like the best option for synergy with Ancient. I can sell Blue to reach $7, which allows me to buy Smeared. I need to ensure selling Blue gives me $2, leaving me with enough for Smeared. I’ll also keep Smiley, Ancient, and Credit. So, the action will be to sell joker 3. I'll format this in the required JSON.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
