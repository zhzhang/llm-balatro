{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the game mechanics where Odd Todd adds chips while Ancient multiplies. Since both are combined at the end, it seems fine to skip any special effects right now. However, maybe I should consider selling something to gain money before leaving, even though selling might allow for a reroll. \n\nWhat if I sell Joker for some cash to buy the Jumbo buffoon? But wait, I have $0. Selling Turtle Bean gives me $3, still not enough. I wonder if selling Ancient for $4 would help us get to $6? We’d have to sacrifice some strong jokers, though. It’s also risky since we mainly use odd ranks and pairs, but I guess the buffoon could lead to better scaling. Plus, I have the Chariot consumable to use later!\n**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nI'm considering that it’s best to keep my current build and proceed to the boss round. I need to perform a round select, but if I choose blind select, I might accidentally pick the boss. Since the command from the shop is specifically for round select, I’ll need to return it as an Action JSON that reflects that action. I think that approach will keep everything organized and on track!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
