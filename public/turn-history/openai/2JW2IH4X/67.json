{"reasoning":"**Choosing game strategies**\n\nI'm considering different strategies for the game. Saturn offers a big +3 multiplier with +30 chips for straight plays, but we hardly play that way, and it's tougher. Mars is good for four-of-a-kind, but I don't see that happening often. Venus might be decent for three-of-a-kind, but if I had to choose, I'd pick Uranus. I just need to command: select 1, and I don't have any specific targets in mind.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
