{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a purchase**\n\nI'm currently in shop ante2 round3, and I have $4 to spend. I’m looking at my options: I can buy the buffoon pack for $4, but the jumbo standard is $6, which I can't afford. The gift card and overstock options are also out of reach. The reroll costs $5, so that's not happening either. It looks like my best move is to buy the buffoon pack, which will later give me a choice of up to 2 jokers. I'm ready to proceed with the purchase!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
