{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker options**\n\nI’m considering the shop's current ante at 4 and my $6. The jokers I have include the Ancient Joker, which is tied to hearts, and others that may need replacing. I have to compare the Smiley Face Joker, which adds a multiplier and works well with face cards, to the Blue Joker that provides a strong independent chip boost. The Smiley Face could boost scores significantly in multi-card scenarios. Every choice could affect scaling, so it’s crucial to assess their strengths carefully.\n**Analyzing joker effectiveness**\n\nI'm considering the Blue Joker, which gives a huge chip boost and scales with deck size. Currently, the deck has about 42 cards left, so the Blue Joker adds 104 chips per hand, which could mean a significant total if my multiplier is high. On the other hand, the Smiley Face adds a multiplier to my score, which could also provide a big boost. I need to decide which joker to keep, and I might have to sell something to make room, like the Turtle Bean, which helps with hand size but might not be necessary soon.\n**Deciding on jokers**\n\nThe Turtle Bean currently adds +2 to my hand size, making it 10, but it's decreasing each round and could vanish soon. It originally contributed +5, so I may not keep it much longer. Selling the Turtle Bean could allow me to buy the Blue Joker, which would boost my scaling in the long run. The Smiley Face might be better than the plain Joker, but the Blue Joker doesn't offer a multiplier, while others like the Ancient Joker and Clever Joker have their own advantages.\n**Analyzing joker values**\n\nI'm comparing the Clever Joker, which adds +80 chips, with Odd Todd, that offers +31 per odd card, usually yielding 62-93 chips. But the Blue Joker consistently gives 104 chips, making it potentially more valuable. If I'm playing certain cards, Odd Todd could spike to 124 chips occasionally. However, if I focus on face cards with the Smiley Face, Odd Todd's synergy decreases. I have $6 and must choose wisely since the Blue Joker costs $5, which means I need to sell one joker to make space.\n**Planning joker transactions**\n\nI think selling the base Joker might be wise since the Smiley Face offers a better multiplier. However, if I buy the Blue Joker, I might still want to keep that +4 multiplier. Selling the Turtle Bean for $3 will give me enough to buy Blue, allowing me to keep more valuable jokers. My plan is to sell the Turtle Bean first, then buy the Blue Joker, and potentially follow up with another purchase later. For now, I’ll take the action to sell the Turtle Bean.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
