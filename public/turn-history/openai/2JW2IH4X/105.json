{"reasoning":"**Choosing tarot cards**\n\nI'm in this tarot selection phase and need to choose two cards from five options. I’m considering the immediate benefits of each: the Empress can enhance multipliers, while the High Priestess offers random planets. The Hierophant provides bonus chips, and the Hermit doubles money up to a maximum. The Fool seems intriguing because it references the last card used, Uranus, which could give a solid boost. Overall, it looks like the Fool and Empress might offer the best immediate advantages!\n**Evaluating tarot choices**\n\nI just realized that the Hermit card might not be a good choice since it doubles money but could put me at -32, and that’s not ideal as it maxes out at $20. I think I’d rather focus on the Empress or Hierophant to buff my cards. With eight cards in hand, I can boost two: multipliers give an additional boost when scored, and bonus cards grant chips. It turns out the ancient multiplier applies to diamonds, boosting the scoring more effectively!\n**Understanding card enhancements**\n\nOkay, so I need to remember the order of operations for scoring each card: starting with base chips, then enhancements, followed by on-scored jokers. The ancient multiplier kicks in after enhancements; if a suit qualifies, it gives a nice synergy when I add the +4 multiplier from the card. For instance, if I score a heart or diamond face card, I get an additional +5 multiplier before the ancient effect comes in. The Fool creates a planet, which seems like a great choice! I just need to decide on my two cards carefully.\n**Choosing the best cards**\n\nI’ve decided to go with The Fool, which creates Uranus in consumables, and that's perfect since my inventory is currently empty. This card doesn’t use the consumable right away; instead, it gives me flexibility to use it later. For my second choice, I think I’ll pick The Empress. It enhances two cards to multipliers, improving my deck immediately. The High Priestess offers random planets, but I prefer the targeted approach with telescopes later. The Hierophant's bonus chips seem less impactful since I already have strong multipliers. Empress feels like the best bet!\n**Finalizing card enhancements**\n\nI need to enhance the right cards from my hand, specifically focusing on hearts and diamonds. It seems that boosting the King and Ace of Hearts will give great multiplier benefits since they both qualify under my scoring strategy. Even though I considered the Queen of Spades for a boost, my strategy focuses heavily on flushes with hearts and diamonds. Therefore, I think selecting The Fool first is best to create Uranus, followed by the Empress to enhance the Ace and King of Hearts. I’ll choose card 5 for the Fool now!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
