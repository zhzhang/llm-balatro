{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm in a decision about playing or skipping the big blind in a game. If I skip, my money will double, but I’ll lose a $4 reward and miss the chance to shop before facing the boss. It's crucial to think if I can beat the boss with my low resources. With current options like Odd Todd and Hierophant not used, it might be smarter to play the big blind to earn money and position myself better for later.\n**Evaluating card usage**\n\nI’m trying to figure out if I can use Hierophant during the blind select, but it turns out I can't since it requires having cards in hand. I may have the chance to use it during the round if that's allowed. However, the command to use consumables also depends on having card positions in hand, which only works in a round state. So the next step is to play the round and return the action in JSON format.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
