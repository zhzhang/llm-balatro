{"reasoning":"**Evaluating the game strategy**\n\nI’m weighing whether to play or skip the small blind. Skipping gives me a powerful Holographic Tag, but this means I’d miss out on a shop after the blind. If I skip both the small and big blinds, I could get tags, which is tempting because an Ethereal Tag grants a free Spectral Pack. However, skipping risks losing reward money and interest, plus I need to make sure I have enough chips. I’m uncertain about the hands needed and the potential consequences of failing.\n**Weighing the game options**\n\nI’m considering whether to skip to get a strong tag, but if I do that, I’ll still need to play the big blind of 7500 or skip again for the Ethereal Tag. If I skip both blinds, I head straight to the boss round. However, that means no shopping until after the boss, which complicates things since skipping blinds also loses me potential money. In the end, playing through the blinds and winning seems more beneficial for my economy than skipping.\n**Assessing economic choices**\n\nI’m reflecting on our poor economy and minimal interest. We have a Telescope voucher and want celestial packs, so skipping could impact our money negatively. However, the Holographic Tag gives us a huge advantage by offering a free Joker in the next base edition shop. That would boost us significantly, though we have max jokers already. Selling one might be necessary. The Ethereal Tag also offers a free Spectral Pack, but we need to consider if we can clear the small blind of 5000 with our jokers. I need to estimate our scoring potential.\n**Calculating chip values**\n\nI'm evaluating how chips are determined in the game. Each card's value equals its rank, with 10 being the base value for numerics. In Balatro, Aces are 11, Kings are 10, and so on. For a two-pair hand, I’m considering that four cards contribute chips, leading to a total of around 264 chips after adding various bonuses, like from the Blue Joker and Clever tag. The multiplier also varies based on face cards and specific suits, currently being Hearts. It’s all about maximizing that scoring!\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI'm weighing whether to skip the small blind for the Holographic Tag, which could greatly enhance my potential by providing a free, high-multiplier joker. With the right cards, specifically face cards and hearts, my multiplier could grow significantly, leading to huge chip gains. While skipping small means I miss immediate cash, the long-term advantages seem promising, especially with potential celestial packs. I think skipping to take advantage of the Holo tag may be my best bet for future success. However, I need to consider risks of facing the boss later.\n**Evaluating tag strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about how the Holographic Tag works—like it’s applied to the next joker in the shop, becoming free and holo. While it’s consuming, I could decide not to buy it if it’s a dud. I need to focus on consistently playing Two Pair against the upcoming boss, as that’s the easiest hand type to play. Skipping the small blind to secure the tag seems wise, but I might miss out on money and the chance to improve my deck. I need to balance the boss challenge with the value the tag could bring. Overall, it’s about power and survivability.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI believe skipping the small blind is the best move since it only offers a $3 reward, while the tag could provide more than $10 in value with a free joker and holo edition. We can still play big for $4 and have the chance to use the tag in the shop afterward. So, I'll go ahead and skip the small blind. I need to format the action as: {\"action\":\"skip_round\", ...}.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
