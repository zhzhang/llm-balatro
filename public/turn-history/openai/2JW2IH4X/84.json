{"reasoning":"**Deciding on action sequence**\n\nI'm examining the card positions, with Temperance in position 1 and Joker in position 2. I can use the command to buy and use Temperance right away, which costs $3 but will net me $8, moving my balance from -13 to -5. That seems beneficial! After that, I might think about purchasing the Director's Cut or voucher as a potential next step. Understanding the turn limit for actions will help me clarify my choices.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
