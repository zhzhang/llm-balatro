{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI need to decide what to buy at the shop before 3 PM with my $7. Turtle Bean is free but might require selling a joker, which is tricky. It's likely a Joker card that increases hand size, but I'm already at my limit. Selling Riff-raff could free up space and give me $3. This way, I can take Turtle Bean without having to sacrifice too much. Sounds like a solid plan!\n**Evaluating options for cards**\n\nI’m considering Delayed Gratification, which is economic but doesn’t score directly. It might help my money situation, but it requires no discards, and my deck isn’t tuned for that. Turtle Bean could help with hand size, but it's common, and I need to make room for another card. Between my jokers, Ancient and Clever Joker look valuable. However, I might have to sell two jokers to take Delayed Gratification and Turtle Bean, so selling Riff-raff seems like the best option to free up space.\n**Comparing card options**\n\nI’m weighing Delayed Gratification against +4 multiplier and Clever Joker. Ancient and Odd Todd seem essential, while Clever is great for two pairs. My previous big score came from a two-pair hand, and adding Clever could boost chips significantly. +4 multiplier is a solid choice too. Turtle Bean helps find pair and flush but decreases hand size each round. Starting with a base hand size of 8, Turtle Bean could help me for a while. If I sell Riff-raff, I’d have $10 to buy the Telescope voucher, which also costs $10.\n**Considering card purchases**\n\nThis could be a game-changer! Celestial packs usually come with a planet for the most played hand, and since I play Two Pair the most, it’d likely boost my gameplay. The planet for Two Pair is Uranus, not Venus, which is for Three of a Kind — not essential, but useful for leveling up my Two Pair consistently. If I sell Riff-raff for $3, I'd have $10 to buy Telescope. But that leaves me broke, so maybe I should buy Turtle Bean first instead.\n**Planning card actions**\n\nI need to sell Riff-raff and then decide whether to buy Delayed Gratification for $4 and a celestial pack for another $4, leaving me with $2. But Telescope might offer more long-term benefits. If I buy a celestial pack now, it might help level up my Two Pair, but without Telescope, I miss guaranteed growth in the future. I think buying Telescope first is best, despite spending all my money. So, I'll sell Riff-raff first, then decide on my next move.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
