{"reasoning":"I'm considering how to arrange independent jokers in this context. I think if there are multiple jokers, I should apply them left-to-right, since that might influence the outcome. I have a Joker that gives a +4 multiplier, Clever with +80 chips, and Turtle Bean seems to impact hand size. It’s the Joker that changes the hand size, and it doesn’t affect the order. So, I can just focus on playing this round without overcomplicating things!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
