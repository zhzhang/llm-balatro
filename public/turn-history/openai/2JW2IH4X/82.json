{"reasoning":"**Choosing card from tarot pack**\n\nI'm deciding to pick the second card from the Mega Arcana tarot pack. Currently, we don’t have any consumables since I've just used Uranus. I see a few options: The Hanged Man could destroy cards, while the World converts something to spades. The High Priestess, though, can create up to 2 random planet cards, which seems appealing. Since I have some space in my slots, I'll choose the High Priestess to create those planet cards. Let's go with that!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
