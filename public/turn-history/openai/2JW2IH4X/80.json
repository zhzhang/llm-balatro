{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card interface**\n\nI'm looking at the interface for the Fool, which says it \"creates the last Tarot card used during this run,\" showing the card name in smaller text. I see it mentions \"The Fool excluded Uranus,\" which seems to suggest that selecting the Fool will generate a Uranus planet. So, when I choose Fool, it creates a Uranus card immediately. In the Arcana pack, selecting Fool uses it right away, making that created card a consumable too.\n**Considering planet options**\n\nI’m thinking about leveling up my hand using planets. If I choose planet, it will level Two Pair to 5, which seems strong! Then maybe I’ll pick the High Priestess, which can create up to 2 random planet cards. Even though there's limited space for consumables, they’ll be used immediately. This gives me flexibility; I could level other hands or sell the planets for about $1. There's also the option to convert cards to improve the chances of having a flush, which might be beneficial too.\n**Evaluating hand strategies**\n\nMy hand levels with a flush at level 1, but the two pair is stronger. I’m considering pivoting to flush strategies since smeared might make it easier. However, the deck is mostly standard, and converting cards to spades doesn't help much. I could use the Hanged Man to thin the deck by removing low cards, like 2s, 3s, and 4s, which could help me build towards face cards. The Hanged Man will only let me destroy two selected cards, though. Also, Wheel of Fortune has a chance to upgrade a joker, but the odds aren’t great.\n**Exploring upgrade options**\n\nI’m considering upgrading Ancient or Smiley to add multipliers, like x1.5 or +10. Different editions for jokers could provide extra chips and multipliers—Foil gives +50 chips, Holographic adds +10, and Polychrome is x1.5. Applying these to Ancient would be strong. However, I’m also mindful of our debt, which is currently -8 but can go to -20. We need to scale up for the upcoming blinds. Picking the Fool (Uranus) first makes sense, and then I’m leaning towards High Priestess for guaranteed planets, despite the risk with Wheel.\n**Deciding card selection order**\n\nI'm considering using the Hanged Man to thin the deck for long-term benefits. The High Priestess is also strong since it creates two planets, enhancing hand levels and boosting our chips/multipliers. While random, it can still be useful, and I could aim for a flush with Jupiter. If needed, planets can be sold for $1 each to help with debt. To maximize this, I’ll pick the Fool first to create Uranus, then select the High Priestess next. I’ll place the Fool in card position 5.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
