{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop purchases**\n\nI'm at the shop where I've sold 4 Jokers, so now I have 4. There's a free holo Credit Card that gives me a +10 multiplier and allows me to go -$20 in debt. I definitely need to buy that! I’m also considering the $10 Seed Money voucher. I have $9, but with the Credit Card, I can buy it even if I'm short. I should buy the card first, then the voucher. Plus, it’s essential to prioritize adding interest caps for the long run, especially during Ante 4 Round 8. Time to purchase the Credit Card!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
