{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm currently in a BLIND_SELECT at boss and need to play a round. It seems the order of jokers matters, especially for scoring. Odd Todd adds chips when certain cards are scored, while Ancient Joker multiplies the score for clubs. Their effects prioritize left-to-right, but I realize that since chip addition and multiplication are independent, the order of jokers doesn’t actually matter for chip gains and multipliers. Therefore, I don't need to rearrange them.\n**Considering card discards**\n\nIt looks like the boss discards 2 random cards each time a hand is played. This could disrupt any strategies I have involving held cards for the Blackboard, which is a bit inconvenient since we don't have that. So, I guess the best course of action is just to move forward and play the round without worrying about the disruptions caused by those random discards. Let's play round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
