{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m in a shop with $2, but I can't buy packs or vouchers—so I have limited choices like rearranging jokers, selling something, or making a selection. Rearranging jokers seems best to optimize their scoring order. The \"on scored\" jokers Smiley and Ancient have specific multipliers that can significantly impact overall scores. If I place Smiley first, I get a +5 multiplier, and then Ancient multiplies that by 1.5 for each heart played — that seems to enhance my chances!\n**Understanding joker triggers**\n\nI realized the jokers trigger based on each card being scored, working sequentially. For a face card of hearts, Smiley adds +5 first, then Ancient multiplies by 1.5. If I switch their order, I get a weaker effect, so it’s best to place Smiley to the left of Ancient. The Clever Joker and Blue Joker function independently, offering significant chips based on their categories. Blue adds chips to my total before multiplication, likely boosting my score after I play cards. This is really strategic!\n**Clarifying independent effects**\n\nI’m thinking about how the order of jokers affects scoring. It seems that chips adders come before multipliers, but they're separate operations. I realize that the order matters when there’s an interplay between multiplication and addition, like with xmult. However, since I only have +4 multiplier and no xmult involved, arranging Smiley before Ancient is my priority. Smiley and Ancient are both on-scored, so I should keep them on the left. Overall order within categories, such as on-scored versus independent, does influence their effectiveness. Rearranging to [Smiley, Ancient, Clever, Blue, Joker] seems like the best choice!\n**Considering joker placement**\n\nI’m figuring out how the order of jokers affects activations for scoring. Each category works left-to-right, so if I put an independent joker between Smiley and Ancient, it wouldn’t disrupt their order as on-scored jokers. The order would still be Smiley followed by Ancient. Keeping Smiley leftmost is simpler. I might also place the Blue Joker before the Clever Joker since they both add chips. However, if there's any future xmult, I need to keep the +mult before it for optimal scoring. For now, the current order works!\n**Deciding on jokers and actions**\n\nI have $2 and I'm considering selling jokers to afford a booster pack, but I'm still short. Selling some jokers, like the Clever or Blue, could get me to $5 to buy the Arcana pack, which may enhance my deck with immediate tarot. However, I'd be sacrificing strong jokers, and I'm unsure if it's worth it given their value in chips. Ultimately, selling more than one joker feels risky. I think it's best to keep my current lineup and rearrange the jokers for optimal play. I'll go with [Smiley, Ancient, Blue, Clever, Joker].\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [5,1,4,3,2]"}
