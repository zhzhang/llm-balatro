{"reasoning":"**Preparing the action**\n\nI’m thinking about the round selection process. It looks like there's only one action to execute, which is “next.” I’ll convert this into a `use_consumable` command. This means I need to specify the command format correctly as `use_consumable 1` and ensure I don’t include any targets. I also need to format this as JSON for proper action execution. All set to move forward with this!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
