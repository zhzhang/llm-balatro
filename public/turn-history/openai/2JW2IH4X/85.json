{"reasoning":"**Considering consumables usage**\n\nI’m realizing that consumables don’t have a cost and don’t take up a slot, but they do consume. Right now, we can max out at 2 consumables. It might be best to use Pluto to boost my high card baseline in case I need to force it. Plus, using consumables in the shop is allowed through the use of a consumable, which would free up a slot.\n**Evaluating Neptune and Joker**\n\nI’m considering selling Neptune for $1 to ease debt since it's less likely I'll make a rare straight flush, though it gives +40 chips and a +4 multiplier. Selling would help clear slots and address debt. About actions per turn, it seems each assistant response counts as one command, so I need to prioritize. Buying the Joker with a +4 multiplier feels powerful and is low-cost, even if it pushes me deeper into debt at -7. I’ll go for the Joker now!\n**Analyzing joker activation in scoring**\n\nI'm considering how the independent jokers activate after scoring, while \"On scored\" jokers like Smiley and Ancient trigger each time a card is scored, left to right. The Credit Card appears to provide a +10 multiplier as an independent joker, applying after scoring. The order of Smiley and Ancient matters since Smiley adds +5 when face cards score, while Ancient multiplies hearts scored by 1.5. \n\nSo, if I apply Smiley first, it gives a better outcome, like (m+5)*1.5 versus m*1.5+5. I should keep Smiley to the left of Ancient for the best results!\n**Understanding multiplier interactions**\n\nI’m figuring out how the independent +10 multiplier from the Credit Card triggers after scoring the entire hand, adding to the total without being affected by the Ancient multiplier. Ancient activates during scoring, impacting each heart card, but since it applies to each one, it's separate from the independent additions. If I buy the basic Joker with a +4 multiplier, I want those effects to apply after the additive multipliers. \n\nIt seems order among independent multipliers doesn't matter as much. I’ll proceed to buy the Joker at position 1 in the shop.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
