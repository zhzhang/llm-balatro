{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker options**\n\nI need to choose between two jokers from the Buffoon pack: one that gives a +4 multiplier and the Business Card that provides money through played face cards. Currently, I have no money, which limits my options. The +4 multiplier is a straightforward scoring boost, while the Business Card offers economic benefits but isn't useful without funds. Since winning rounds gives potential money, I think I'll go with the +4 multiplier joker for better scoring.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
