{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI’m thinking about the tarot selection I made and how we've returned to the shop with $3. It looks like I can buy The Chariot, which is a consumable. Since Bootstraps and the Buffoon pack are too pricey and I can't reroll, buying The Chariot makes sense. I can purchase it and later use it during hand selection. It seems like I can utilize it immediately from my inventory in the shop.\n**Considering card usage**\n\nIn the shop, it seems like I don’t have my hand displayed, which makes it tricky because using a consumable requires targeting card positions in hand. Since there's no current hand, I can't use the consumable right now, but I could later in the round once I have one. The idea is to buy it now and use it later, ideally on a low-rank card I want to keep. It's important to remember that the steel effect works only when held and can stack with multiple cards.\n**Weighing card decisions**\n\nI just remembered that the Devil turned the 4 of hearts into a gold card, which I need to hold for $3 at the end of the round. So ideally, I also want to hold a steel card. But if I use The Chariot on the gold card, it would replace its enhancement, which isn’t good. I should consider another low card to steel later instead. Buying The Chariot now is a good move, especially since I have empty slots. Even though it leaves me with $0, it's still early, so maybe spending all is okay.\n**Planning card actions**\n\nI’m considering my options: my current card reduces by 1 each round but offers a +3 hand size now, which drops to +2 next round. It can sell for $3, but I think it's still valuable to hold onto the gold and steel cards. Selling the Joker seems unwise, even though it's clever for a two-pair strategy. I might get rid of the Turtle Bean later, but not right now. So, I’ll go ahead and use the \"buy_card\" action to purchase The Chariot. It’s the right choice since it’s a shop card, not a booster.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
