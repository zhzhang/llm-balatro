{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a planet card**\n\nI need to choose one of three planet cards right away. The best option seems to be Uranus since it offers the most common hand: a two pair, which is played the most. The other options, Neptune and Jupiter, provide a straight flush and flush respectively, but they don’t seem as favorable. I noticed the jokers in play support two pairs, so I’m going to select Uranus. I’ll go ahead with that choice now.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
