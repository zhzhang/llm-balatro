{"reasoning":"**Analyzing joker order effects**\n\nI’m considering how the order of joker effects matters for scoring with Smiley and Ancient. The Smiley adds a +5 multiplier, while Ancient multiplies the current multiplier by 1.5 for each card scored. \n\nIt seems like having Smiley before Ancient would be optimal since the +5 would then get multiplied by Ancient’s effect. The independent triggers occur left-to-right, but that order doesn’t affect the category 5 independent bonuses. I’ll keep that in mind!\n**Clarifying Credit Card mechanics**\n\nI’m figuring out the effect of the Credit Card, which gives a +10 multiplier at the independent stage, and it seems its effect isn’t influenced by Ancient since Ancient applies during the on-scored stage. \n\nSo, the Credit Card’s +10 won't be multiplied by Ancient, while Smiley’s +5 could be if it’s applied before Ancient and if the card's suit is correct. Since Smiley applies per card but Ancient evaluates suit when triggered, it looks like keeping Smiley before Ancient is the best choice!\n**Arranging joker order**\n\nI'm working through how Joker effects apply from left-to-right within categories. It seems like adding Smeared before Ancient is a good idea because it checks the suit using Smeared's rules, although passive suit rules are likely always active. \n\nIn the shop, I think we should rearrange the jokers with the order: Smeared, Smiley, Ancient, and Credit Card doesn't need to change. Currently, Smiley is already before Ancient, which is good, but swapping Smeared and Ancient seems necessary to be safe!\n**Exploring buying options**\n\nI'm thinking about whether I should sell something to afford a standard pack for $4, but currently, we have $0. If I sell one joker for $2, it’s not enough for the pack, but selling two would give me $4. I wonder if selling something low-impact like Smiley or Smeared is worth it, but their synergy is good.\n\nHowever, I just realized that the Credit Card allows me to go up to -$20 in debt, so I can actually buy the standard pack or even the mega arcana pack without selling anything!\n**Deciding on booster purchases**\n\nI'm contemplating whether to buy the Mega Arcana pack for $8, which would get me some immediate tarot options for deck improvement. Although the standard pack seems less impactful, it’s still worth considering. Debt is acceptable if it leads to better power, since I can go up to -$20 in debt.\n\nI think the Mega Arcana pack is the best choice to enhance my deck quickly. This gives me two tarot cards immediately, which could provide significant advantages. So, I'll proceed to buy the Mega Arcana pack for -$8!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
