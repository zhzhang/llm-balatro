{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI think it's wise to invest now, targeting two odd rank cards—Ace and either 7 or 3. Ace high is valuable in many scoring situations, but a pair might change that. The bonus card adds +30 chips, and it would be essential for the final hand. I’ll aim for Ace and 7 since 7 can work with pairs and straights. I should enhance my deck long term using Hierophant on Ace♣ and 7♣ to maximize chips.\n**Examining card strategies**\n\nI'm considering playing high card Ace, which would score only 5 chips, but the bonus could elevate it a bit. If I play pairs or trips with odd ranks, I don’t have a pair yet, so forming a straight or flush seems unlikely. For the current blind, I need 450 chips, possibly from multiple hands. Attempting to make a full house again by keeping the pair of 6s might be best. I need to discard excess cards and aim for another pair with four hands and three discards. Playing the pair of 6s with extra cards might not score additional points, though.\n**Calculating card scores**\n\nI’m trying to determine my score with a pair: the base chips for a pair are 10, plus the two cards contribute another 12, bringing me to a total of 22. If I apply a multiplier of 2, that totals to 44, which is still too low. I could play \"high card Ace,\" calculated with a bonus score giving 77, but that’s also low. Since I don’t have pairs or straights, I should discard to improve and chase a full house. With two 6s drawn out, it’s promising since we could still make trips or quads.\n**Planning for a club flush**\n\nI have three clubs already—Ace, 7, and 2—which means I could aim for a flush by drawing two more. However, with a hand size limit of eight, I need to keep two clubs when playing. I could discard non-clubs like Q♠, 6♠, 6♥, J♦, and 3♦, but that's five cards. I think it makes more sense to hold onto the pair of 6s for a full house. The odds of drawing clubs aren't great—there are only 8 left in a 39-card deck, so I might need another discard.\n**Strategizing for card combinations**\n\nI’m considering going for a straight using A, 2, 3, and needing 4 and 5, which could be easier. The odds for drawing a 4 and a 5 aren't great, with only three 4s and four 5s left in a 39-card deck. I might be better off aiming for a full house with my pair of 6s, but the chance of pulling a third 6 is low. \n\nInstead, focusing on pairs seems smarter, especially aiming for Aces or 7s with bonuses using Hierophant. I'll discard cards that aren't beneficial while keeping my boosted cards and discarding others to improve my hand. It's a balance of cards to keep for the best possible combination!\n**Deciding on the next action**\n\nI need to take one action now and it seems like using Hierophant would be the best choice. It upgrades my deck and helps me beat the blind, which is a plus. The only downside is losing this consumable, which isn't too concerning since it sells for just 1. I'll go ahead and use it, so I'll return a JSON action for using the consumable with positions [1, 4, 5]. That should set me up nicely!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,4,5]"}
