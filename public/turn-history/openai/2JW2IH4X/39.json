{"reasoning":"**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m realizing the count reduces by 1 every round, specifically at the end of the blind. We start with the big blind, and Turtle will shrink after that, leaving me with a +3. The boss effect gives me -1, leading to a net of +2, which still seems okay. Currently, last two pairs scored 2030 chips, but I need 3000, which I think I can accumulate in two hands. The score adjustments with jokers and suits also offer helpful boosts, so I believe I can exceed 3000 reliably.\n**Evaluating shop strategy**\n\nI just realized we came from the shop already. I’m wondering if the rare tag will apply after the boss fight. The shop has a free Rare Joker, which we could access if we skip the big blind. If I skip to the boss blind select, I’ll still get the chance to shop afterward and potentially get that rare joker. But skipping the shop before the boss could be risky if I need more power. Still, maybe we’ll be okay.\n**Evaluating strategy for rewards**\n\nI’m realizing that missing the $4 reward and potential hands’ money could limit my future buying power, though the free rare joker might balance that out. I need to compare options: playing the big blind for the chance to shop, then face the boss, or skipping the big blind and going straight to the boss and then shopping with the free rare. Playing looks safer and could enhance my economy, plus I might save up for Earth. I’m wondering if I should rearrange my jokers since scoring triggers from left to right.\n**Clarifying multiplier order**\n\nOkay, I’m thinking about the order of Ancient versus Odd. The Ancient card multiplies by 1.5 each card, so order impacts scaling since it multiplies sequentially, but both are multiplicative. Odd adds chips but doesn’t change multipliers, which seems fine. I wonder if it's better to have a higher base multiplier before Ancient triggers. If Ancient activates early, it multiplies a smaller value, and later cards can multiply again. Each scored club card triggers its own multiplier, so that’s significant! I need to keep in mind that additive multipliers can help before the main multiplication.\n**Deciding on joker usage**\n\nI see that the Joker +4 is independent after scoring and doesn’t get multiplied by Ancient. I’m wondering if I could treat Joker +4 as an “on scored” joker, but it seems like that’s not possible. If I want other multipliers to apply after the +4, it complicates things since Ancient triggers per card during scoring. Since there’s no current shop, perhaps I should sell the basic Joker to make space for something better. For now, I’ll just play a round and remember to output the action in JSON format.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
