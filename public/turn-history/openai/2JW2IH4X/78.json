{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card purchase strategy**\n\nWe're considering buying the Smeared Joker for $7, which would fit perfectly since I already have three jokers and can have a maximum of five. The Smeared Joker synergizes well with the Ancient suit. This synergy can trigger additional effects, effectively doubling the expected triggers when certain suits align. After purchasing it, I'll be back to $0, so I can't make any more buys. I’ll also need to rearrange the order of jokers for optimal scoring, considering how their effects stack together.\n**Analyzing card triggers and order**\n\nOkay, so when a card with the Heart suit is scored, Ancient gives a 1.5 multiplier. Smiley adds a +5 multiplier when a face card is scored, and if it’s the same card, I need to keep Smiley before Ancient in the sequence for the best effect. The Smeared Joker changes suit evaluation passively, but since it's not a scoring trigger, placing it before Ancient should be fine to apply suit equivalence. The Credit Card also offers an independent +10 multiplier, which remains additive regardless of order.\n**Clarifying card multipliers and purchase**\n\nIt seems like Ancient is the only card providing a multiplier when scored, offering a 1.5 increase per card. The Credit Card’s +10 is independent and activates after scoring, meaning it doesn’t affect the per-card multiplier triggered by Ancient. So, I need to remember that arrangements are only relevant for the jokers that benefit from scoring, which keeps Smiley first, followed by Ancient. Alright, I’ll go ahead and buy the Smeared card now.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
