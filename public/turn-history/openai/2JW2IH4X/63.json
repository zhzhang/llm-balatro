{"reasoning":"**Evaluating the credit card details**\n\nSo, I’m at the shop after beating the Big Blind Ante 4. There's a Credit Card Joker holo that costs $0, which is interesting! The credit card allows me to go up to -$20 in debt and adds a +10 multiplier because it's a holographic edition. But I need to sell a joker to make room since I already have five. It seems like the credit card is quite strong, especially compared to the basic Joker’s +4 multiplier.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI'm considering selling a Joker (position 5) to buy a card, but it seems I can only do one action at a time. The command list allows for either selling or buying, but I need to sell the Joker first to free up a slot. I can't buy a card if I’m full. I might also think about buying a booster pack instead. The credit card lets me go into debt, so I could buy a Seed Money voucher eventually. However, I need the credit card first to make that work.\n**Determining actions for purchases**\n\nI need to sell a Joker to buy a credit card and possibly a voucher, but I can’t do it all at once. I think the best first step is to sell the Joker +4, then I can buy the credit card afterward. If I sell it now, I'll gain $1, making my total $9. That’s great because I can buy a booster pack or something else. However, since the credit card is free, should I buy that right after selling? Buying the booster now might help me get planets for my two pair.\n**Analyzing celestial packs and strategy**\n\nI’m looking at our options with the telescope, and I see the most played hands are two pair versus full house. It seems the celestial pack will always include Uranus for two pairs, which is relevant for our strategy. The planets are mapped to hands, like Mercury for pair and Earth for full house. So, if I buy the Jumbo Celestial pack for $6, I might get Uranus and possibly other planets like Earth. However, while Jupiter might help with a flush, we haven’t focused on that yet.\n**Planning credit card strategy**\n\nI’m thinking it's better to get the credit card instead of spending $6 on a pack. However, I need a slot for that, so I’ll have to swap in the Joker +4 first. Once that’s done, I can buy the credit card and potentially use it for Seed Money or another pack. The Seed Money has a strong interest cap. I need to take three actions: sell the Joker, buy the credit card, and then get the voucher. I’ll start by selling the Joker +4 now, as it sets everything up!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
