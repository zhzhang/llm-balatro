{"reasoning":"**Clarifying card selection and scoring**\n\nI’m thinking about the card selection process and how many cards are left after discarding. If I start with 8 cards, but then it seems there are actually 6 to keep. Playing two pairs feels strong, especially with about 300 chips. I’ll confirm the indices of my chosen cards: QH, QD, 10C, 10D, 9S. The scoring seems to be sensitive to order—each card's placement influences how we manage chips and multipliers. I might need to consider triggering my multipliers after adding initial chips.\n**Evaluating scoring and multipliers**\n\nI’m clarifying how the x1.5 multiplier works independently of chips, which makes order less critical. However, I want my 10C to be first for that multiplier advantage. I need to ensure my five selected cards create two pairs instead of a full house—got it! When I calculate, based on the initial 20 chips and the additional chips from my selected cards, I’m estimating a total of 69 chips. With the odd Todd's trigger on 9S, my total climbs to 100, coupled with multipliers for Ancient triggers. Now to respond in JSON format.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,2,5,6,1]"}
