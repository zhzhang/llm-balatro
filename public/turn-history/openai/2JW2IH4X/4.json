If I play five cards, I need a low kicker that doesn't impact my chips, like the 2\\u2663. However, if that kicker isn\\u2019t part of the hand, it won\\u2019t contribute chips. Since I have 8 cards total, I need to pick 5 and keep some hearts for a potential flush later, but I only have 4 hearts. I might also think about going for a full house or three-of-a-kind instead.\\n**Calculating flush probabilities**\\n\\nFor a flush, all 5 cards contribute to the hand's value, and each card adds chips. For instance, if I have 5 hearts with decent ranks, I could get a base of 35 plus the sum of the ranks multiplied by 4. A flush could potentially beat a blind in one hand!\\n\\nNow, I already have 4 hearts, so if I discard non-heart cards and draw new ones, my hand size is 8, and I need one more heart to complete the flush. There are 9 hearts left in a deck of 44 cards, making my chances fairly good! After each hand, I can draw to refill my cards.\\n**Deciding on card strategy**\\n\\nI'm weighing my options: I could discard some non-hearts to try to get a heart for a flush, but playing a solid two pair seems like a safer bet that won\\u2019t waste my discard. The flush could definitely be better, but it\\u2019s not absolutely necessary. Reaching 300 chips might require three hands, but I only have four in total. \\n\\nPlaying two pair now sounds like a good plan. After that, I'll still have three hands left to maximize my winnings. I\\u2019d ideally like to clear the blind in two hands, so if I can make 120 in the first hand, I'll need 180 in the second. That\\u2019s similar to the flush goal, or even three-of-a-kind, which has its own benefits with a base multiplier.\\n**Analyzing hand possibilities**\\n\\nI'm considering making a three-of-a-kind with tens. I need one more 10 from the deck, and there are indeed 2 tens remaining. In my hand, I already have two 10s and two Jacks. For a three-of-a-kind, if I get that missing ten, the score would be a base of 30 plus the 10s gives me 90, multiplied by 3 for 270. \\n\\nHowever, it looks like that might not be enough. For Jacks, it would be similar, but a four-of-a-kind with 10s or Jacks would yield even more chips. Comparing this with a flush, the potential score could be higher at around 300, depending on the sum of the chips. A straight could also work, needing five cards to maximize my score.\\n**Weighing hands and strategies**\\n\\nTo clear in two hands, my second hand needs to be strong\\u2014either a flush, straight, or high two pair. A flush would give a solid score since I'd need chips from five hearts. I'm considering discarding three non-heart cards to increase my chances of getting a flush, which would yield around 300 chips if everything goes well. \\n\\nCalculating chip values shows that even a flush with lower-ranking cards might still fall short of 300 chips. Therefore, it might be better to aim for two pair instead now and set up the second hand for three-of-a-kind or something higher. Playing strategically with my pairs now will help preserve my potential for winning money in future hands.\\n**Considering optimal hands**\\n\\nI'm thinking about my best options for playing two pairs. If I use 2\\u2665 2\\u2663 10\\u2665 10\\u2666 and J\\u2666, I get a base of 20 plus the chip values for a total of 44, leading to 88 chips when multiplied. But, actually, using Jacks as my pair would give me more value because they have higher chip values. \\n\\nIf I can draw another Jack or 10 while keeping my pairs, that could work. I could discard some hearts, like K\\u2665 and 5\\u2665, while keeping 10\\u2665 for the pair. The probability of drawing at least one Jack or 10 from the remaining deck isn\\u2019t great, and might only yield about 32.5%. \\n\\nSo, it seems like playing my immediate best hand\\u2014two pair J and 10\\u2014would be the most straightforward option. I'll adjust my plan based on that and estimate chips for the hand to be around 120. Now I\\u2019ll prepare a JSON action for that.\\n\\nCommand: play 2 5 7 8 6 two pair 120\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 3]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 5 of Spades.

It looks like we need to estimate our chips for the game: if we play big blind, we need 450 chips. I'll calculate how much we might earn from winning rounds, and how interest works with our total at the end of the round. I think if we start with 9 chips and manage the rounds well, we could finish around 17.\\n**Evaluating strategy for vouchers**\\n\\nI'm thinking about how much we need to save to buy a $10 voucher after playing big blind. If we skip buying now, our money could double to 18, but we won't be able to buy the voucher before facing the boss. That voucher is important since it gives an extra hand each round. I believe the best option could be to play big blind first and then buy the voucher. There's also the possibility of buying Drunkard for $4 now to boost our strategy, leaving enough to possibly buy Grabber later!\\n**Analyzing purchase options**\\n\\nI'm considering whether to buy the buffoon pack for $4, but if I do, I might not have enough for the voucher later. If I only get Drunkard, I can save money for the voucher after the big blind. Another strategy could be to buy the buffoon pack and skip the big blind to preserve funds, but that doesn't seem like a solid plan. Buying Drunkard now while keeping enough money for future purchases, like Grabber, seems to be the best approach! Alternatively, I could also buy Hierophant for $3 and still have a viable path to get the voucher later.\\n**Deciding on purchases**\\n\\nI'm trying to choose between options. Drunkard looks appealing since the boss discards cards each hand played. Wait, the boss actually discards 2 random cards from your hand, which makes saving cards harder. Still, Drunkard could help later. Hierophant seems good too since it gives a permanent bonus to two cards, increasing chips. The buffoon pack is a gamble, but scoring a joker early could help a lot. Ultimately, if I buy the celestial pack for 4, I might still afford the voucher later!\\n**Choosing the celestial or buffoon pack**\\n\\nI'm considering buying a pack, and the celestial pack levels up a hand type immediately, which could be really helpful. For example, I could choose the Full House planet, Earth. But I'm unsure about the options in the buffoon pack. While the celestial pack seems strong early, the buffoon pack has its merits too, especially with the potential for jokers. Since I can buy either and still have enough for the voucher later, I'm leaning towards the buffoon pack as my priority. I'll go ahead and buy the buffoon pack!\\n\\nCommand: buy_booster 1\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: BUFFOON_PACK\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $5\\n## Pack Choices\\nBooster Pack Choices:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nselect <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> <hand_card_position2> ... <hand_card_positionN> - Select a card from the booster pack. The hand card positions may be required depending on if the booster pack card selected needs targets. In 'Mega' booster packs that say 'choose 2 of N', make the selections one at a time. If you intend to select cards 1 and 3 for example, issue a 'select 1' command, then a 'select 2' command, because the 3rd card position will become the second position after selecting the first card.\\nskip_booster - Skip the remaining selections in the current booster pack.\\n\\n#Task\\nAnalyze the total game state and context above, and respond with the appropriate action to take next.\"}",
