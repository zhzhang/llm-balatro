{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm considering whether to sell the Joker and Blue card. Selling two then gaining a third seems beneficial, but since Blue sells for two, I could end up losing a significant chip. Maybe I should just save my money and skip the shop, but then I miss opportunities. The tarot cards could be advantageous in Balatro, though which joker is the least critical? Losing one might reduce my multiplier; I should evaluate if it's worth it.\n**Assessing card selling strategies**\n\nI need to reach $4, which means I might need to sell a couple of cards. If I sell the Joker, it gives me $3. But to buy the pack, I'd need $4. I could consider selling Clever to hit that target, but what about Blue, Smiley, or Ancient? They seem too valuable. Selling Joker and Clever might seem like a bad trade-off because it gives me tarot effects, but maybe selling only Clever to buy the Arcana is worth it if I get some useful cards.\n**Considering card strategies**\n\nClever gives a reliable +80 chips on a two pair, which is quite valuable. But I could sell it to buy a Standard pack, which would give me an extra card that might enhance my strategy. Though the Standard packs offer just a choice of three cards, the chance of getting something useful like a steel or bonus card intrigues me. Since my build focuses on two pairs and capitalizes on suits with Ancient changing each round, I might need to lean more into face cards for versatility and opportunities.\n**Exploring scoring options**\n\nI'm focused on the two pair strategy, but with only four scoring cards, I wonder if I should shift to a full house or straight for better scoring. The joker triggers for each card in that suit, but it only counts cards in my hand. If I aim for a full house, all five cards would score, making the Ancient suit's multiplier very impactful. Selling Clever might be worth it to invest in Arcana and tarot cards like Death or Strength that could help me build those combinations.\n**Deciding on card strategies**\n\nI have a Telescope voucher for celestial packs, but they're not available in the shop. So, I’m leaning towards keeping all my jokers for now. I could sell Clever to buy a Standard pack and pick a strong card, but I need consistent points at ante4, especially since I might need around 4000 to beat the next blind. Clever's contribution of +80 chips could mean a significant boost, so maybe it's better to hold onto it. Ultimately, I should proceed with round_select for now.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
