{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a purchase**\n\nI’m currently at a shop with $0, and Turtle Bean is available for $0, so it makes sense to buy it to fill my last joker slot. It adds +5 to my hand size, decreasing by 1 each round, which is substantial early on. The only downside is occupying a slot, but since it's free and can be sold later, I’ll go for it. After that, I won’t be able to buy anything else due to having no money left. So, I'll buy Turtle Bean now!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
