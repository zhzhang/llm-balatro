{"reasoning":"**Choosing tarot cards**\n\nI need to select a tarot card from the Arcana pack, and I'm dealing with a debt of -13. My options include the Hermit, which can double my money, but since it's capped at $20, it won't help much if I'm already negative. I wonder if Temperance might give me some value by selling jokers for +12, which could bring me closer to breaking even. Wheel of Fortune offers a risky chance of adding an edition to a random joker, while Strength only slightly increases my card ranks. Death could transform a card, possibly duplicating a valuable card.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI could duplicate a Gold card worth $3, which might boost my economy over rounds. However, creating pairs seems more powerful since my main scoring comes from Two Pair and Full House. Duplicating a face card for the Ancient Joker could trigger a multiplier for scoring. I can use Death to turn a card into Jack of Clubs to form a pair and trigger Smiley—it's not huge but helpful. Temperance gives me immediate cash of $12, which gets me closer to clearing my debt, so I should choose that from the Arcana pack.\n**Making a card choice**\n\nChoosing Temperance seems like the best option for recovery right now. I could use Death to duplicate a Gold card for $3 each round, but that would take four rounds to break even, while Temperance gives me cash immediately. Since I need that quick recovery, I’ll go for Temperance. Plus, selecting it doesn’t require any targets, which makes it simpler. This feels like the right move to make in this situation!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
