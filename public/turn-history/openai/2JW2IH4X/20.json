{"reasoning":"**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m evaluating the Buffoon pack for its potential high scoring due to strong jokers, even though it’s high variance. An alternative could be buying a Gift Card to help scale sell values, but I only have two jokers right now, which makes it less attractive for immediate scoring. I don't want to buy Jupiter. I'm thinking of getting the Venus pack first, then the Buffoon pack. So I'll choose to buy card position 2 now. I'll format this as JSON with the action \"buy_card\" and position [2].\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
