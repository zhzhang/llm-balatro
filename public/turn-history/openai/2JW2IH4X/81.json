{"reasoning":"**Deciding on tarot choice**\n\nI need to choose a second tarot card from my mega arcana pack after already selecting the Fool. We’re left with choices 1-4, but I previously planned to go with the High Priestess. However, I must consider consumable slots, as I can only have two. Since one slot is occupied by Uranus, I realize I might benefit from using it now to free up space. Using Uranus first could level my two pair and then allow for High Priestess to create two planets. I'll make my move accordingly!\n**Determining next action**\n\nI need to figure out the next appropriate action, which might be using a consumable first. The user had planned to select the High Priestess second. Using Uranus doesn’t require a target, so I could go ahead and use it to free up a slot before selecting the High Priestess. However, I’m also considering the Wheel of Fortune for a potential upgrade, but it feels uncertain compared to the guaranteed planets from the Priestess. I'll go with using Uranus first and rearranging the jokers too!\n**Understanding card triggers**\n\nFor per-card triggers, I see that Smiley gives a +5 multiplier and Ancient offers a x1.5 multiplier. I should trigger Smiley before Ancient; this order seems to maximize the output since Smiley first results in a higher multiplier overall. Smeared is passive, so its placement isn’t urgent right now. I’m planning to use the consumable to level my two pair up to level 5, which boosts my chips to 100. I'll execute that action now!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
