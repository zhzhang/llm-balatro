{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop with $7, considering the possible purchases, including tarot and various jokers. The Chariot costs $3, Joker Bootstraps is $7, and there are boosters like jumbo buffoon for $6 and arcana pack for $4. I need to decide on the best long-term strategy for ante 3/8, looking at our current build. I realize Bootstraps gives only +2 multiplier for $5, which isn't as good as Joker with its +4. Evaluating money management is crucial!\n**Maximizing Bootstraps and Chariot**\n\nTo get the most out of Bootstraps, I need to keep my money high and avoid spending, which isn't suitable right now. The Chariot offers a strong x1.5 multiplier when held, and with Turtle Bean's larger hand size, it supports better scaling. Buying The Chariot makes it a consumable. I could use buy_and_use for that, but I might waste a slot since I have two empty. Alternatively, I could consider the Arcana pack for immediate tarot options to maximize value!\n**Considering budget options**\n\nThe Jumbo Buffoon pack for $6 offers a new Joker choice, but I’d need to sell an existing one since I’m at max capacity. While I might find something better, it’s still a risk. With just $7, if I buy that pack, I’ll only have $1 left, so no Chariot or reroll possibilities. \n\nA better option seems to be buying the Arcana Pack for $4 and the Chariot for $3. That way, I can create steel cards or improve my strategy! I might get cards like The Hermit or Death for interesting effects, even if there’s no guarantee.\n**Strategizing card value**\n\nI’m considering the benefits of creating steel cards, but I’m wondering if turning a high-rank card could reduce chip value when played. Holding a low-rank card, like a 2, could be useful since they won't be played. Since I need to hold steel cards for larger multipliers, I think my hand size plays a key role. Buying both options leaves me with no money left, which could hinder my interest next round, so I might hold off on selling Turtle Bean for now. Clever Joker’s bonus on Two Pair helps, especially as it’s my most played hand!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m considering whether to open the Jumbo Buffoon pack for a better Joker, but I'd need to drop an existing one, and that feels risky. Instead, it might be safer to invest in steel cards since they're more reliable. I think buying the Chariot for $3 is a good move. \n\nWith $4 left, I could buy the Arcana pack too! It requires immediate use, so my plan is to buy the Arcana pack first, check my options, and then decide if I need to get the Chariot later. Let's go for buy_booster 2!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
