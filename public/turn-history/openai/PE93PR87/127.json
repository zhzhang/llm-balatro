{"reasoning":"**Weighing card options**\n\nI'm at the shop with $6 and 5 jokers, looking to buy Even Steven for $4, which I had planned. There's Jumbo Arcana for $6, but then I can't get Even Steven. I think Even Steven is strong with Splash and the two-pair style; plus, it would work well with even ranks. Arcana could provide benefits for constellation scaling, though. However, Even Steven offers immediate improvement with +4 multiplier per even card scored, which is very tempting!\n**Considering card purchases**\n\nI have some options to consider now! I can buy the Standard pack for $4, or the Wily Joker for the same price. However, if I get Even Steven for $4, I’ll have 6 jokers but only $2 left, which isn’t enough for the Standard pack. I’m contemplating if I should buy Even Steven and then sell something for the pack. Or I could just opt for the arcana pack for $6. Still, Even Steven seems like a more consistent choice, so I think I'll go for it!\n**Analyzing jokers' scoring order**\n\nThe order of scoring with on-scored jokers is important because it can affect the +4 multiplier applied. This additive multiplier changes how other functions apply later, like Luchador and Constellation, which add independent multipliers of x1.5 and x1.6, respectively. Spare Trousers offers a +2 bonus if the played hand contains two pairs, so it seems independent too. Supernova adds a count independently, and Splash modifies scoring without affecting order. Even Steven's effect will occur while scoring each card, improving the overall multiplier. I might consider placing Even Steven early to maximize this.\n**Evaluating scoring order**\n\nIf I have multiple on-scored jokers, the order may impact the outcome of subsequent jokers. For example, one could add a multiplier while another applies a different multiplier. Right now, only Even Steven is on-scored, while the others are independent, meaning the order doesn't matter. On-scored jokers are executed during scoring, and independent ones apply later. Therefore, since they're in different categories, I don’t need to rearrange them. I think my next action will be to buy card 1!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
