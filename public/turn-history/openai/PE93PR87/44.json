{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a situation where I have $2, which isn’t enough to buy any boosters since they cost more. I could sell something to afford one, but if I sell Sly, I'd only have $3, still not enough. Selling Mystic Summit gets me to $4, but it's a strong card that gives a good multiplier. Selling the Certificate for $5 would let me buy a booster, but it also clutters my deck with new cards. I need to weigh these options carefully. Also, I realized I misunderstood how full house works in the game; it actually contains two pairs.\n**Clarifying game mechanics**\n\nI’ve realized that a full house consists of 3+2, while two pairs can be formed from four cards. The rules mention that in Balatro, a scored hand might contain another type, like how a full house contains a two pair. This means I should focus on playing full houses, which will help with Spare Trousers scaling. I’m considering using Justice on a key card, but I can’t target it since I can't see my hand in the shop. Selling it for $1 is an option, but it’s useful for bosses. Maybe it’s best to leave the shop and move on to the next round.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’ve learned that use_consumable targets need cards in hand, but since I'm in the shop, I can't access my hand. Some tarot cards might target in the deck, but I can't use that command either. My best option seems to be round_select. Now, selling the Certificate could fund an Arcana pack, which might give me a Planet card to boost my Constellation; that'd be helpful. However, I need $4 to do this, and selling the Certificate yields $3, leaving me with only $1 afterward. I’m weighing if that’s worth it. The Arcana pack provides tarot cards, but it doesn't improve hand levels like Planets do.\n**Considering card choices**\n\nThe Arcana pack might give me tarot cards useful for full house or glass, but I already have Justice. A standard pack could add a helpful card with a seal, although I'm not sure about its value since the Certificate provides a random sealed card each round. That’s quite strong for generating seals, but it’s random. It might be better to keep the Certificate and save my $2 for the future since I can’t earn interest now. However, if I sold the Certificate for $5, I could earn $1 interest each round. Losing the Certificate seems significant.\n**Weighing options in the shop**\n\nI’m considering selling the Certificate while keeping the $5 to start earning interest, which seems smart. Selling Sly or Mystic Summit would still leave me without interest, so selling the Certificate looks like the best path. However, the Certificate adds a sealed card to my hand each round, which could be valuable, despite potentially bloating my deck and causing inconsistency. It seems I would rather keep it for the seals. \n\nSince I'm not seeing anything beneficial in the shop, it looks like my best option is to choose round_select and move forward.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
