{"reasoning":"**Analyzing boss mechanics**\n\nI'm considering the current boss mechanics, where \"all face cards are drawn face down.\" This means I can't see the rank or suit, making it tricky to build two pair or a full house since identification is limited. My build relies on Scary Face, which uses face cards, but if the cards are face down, I can't tell which are which. Still, they likely count for scoring, given Splash affects every played card. I could reroll using Director's Cut if needed.\n**Evaluating scoring strategy**\n\nWith a 70k threshold, I see that our two pair scores around 30-36k, so we probably need about three hands to reach that. Using a grabber gives us an additional hand each round, so we're likely looking at five hands total. \n\nIt seems challenging but doable if we can make those two pairs or even a full house. If face cards are hidden, I can still try to create two pairs with non-face cards. Rerolling could lead to worse outcomes, but I think I'd prefer to take that chance to avoid uncertainty.\n**Assessing hand strategy**\n\nI think it might be manageable to play hands with known numbers (2-10) to make two pairs, while face cards could still serve as unknown fillers. With Splash, using five cards guarantees scoring, even if they aren’t in hand; a high card can score around 15-17k, and two pairs can hit 30k. I need 70k total, so if I get two two-pairs and a high card, that might work. \n\nHowever, hidden face cards may complicate forming those two pairs since I might accidentally include a face card. Since hand ranking depends on the best among played cards, it’s crucial to intentionally pick cards to form those pairs, which is easier when I can see the ranks.\n**Exploring chip strategy**\n\nIf some of my hand cards are face down, I can’t select them, so I'd stick to visible cards. However, if too many are face down, it might complicate things. I think the deck will still have enough number cards to work with. My main strategy relies on face cards to earn Scary Face chips, which add +30 each. Losing the selection ability might lower chips, but not significantly since I'm multiplying with trousers, popcorn, and the constellation bonuses. \n\nSo, with trousers giving +28 and popcorn +20, my base multiplier for two pair is 5. Adding these seems to give me 53, then multiplying by 2.1 gets me around 111.3. Plus, base chips would give me 80. With Splash, all five cards contribute chips, so I could be looking at over 80 plus the added card chips. It’s tricky!\n**Determining hand requirements**\n\nPreviously, my two pairs scored 36k, which seems close to hitting the 70k target with just two hands. Adding another possible hand, I realized I actually need a minimum of three hands to reach the goal, and with five hands available, that should work. I think I can still make two pairs even if some face cards are hidden. \n\nI'm leaning towards not rerolling since the current boss isn’t too challenging. Rerolling could introduce risky effects, like debuffing all clubs. Plus, while I need to manage my money for shop items later, keeping $10 for interest could also be wise. Thus, avoiding the reroll appears to be the best choice. I’ll focus on playing the round according to my strategy.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
