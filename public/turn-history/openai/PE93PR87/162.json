{"reasoning":"**Evaluating boss mechanics**\n\nI’m looking at the mechanics of different game bosses and their card interactions. For instance, “The Tooth” causes a loss of $1 per played card, while “The Club” debuffs all club cards. Then there’s “The Fish,” which draws all face cards face down. This creates a huge challenge since with Pareidolia, it seems all cards are treated as face cards. If all are drawn face down, it'll be tough to see values. I need to think about how this actually plays out in practice.\n**Assessing card mechanics**\n\nIn Balatro, Pareidolia alters what cards are considered face, which should also affect all game mechanics, including those of bosses. The joker suggests all cards drawn are treated as face cards, so if the boss's effect applies, my entire hand could end up face down, making it impossible to know card values. This could be disastrous unless I have a strong build for random cards. I can reroll the boss with Director's Cut, but I currently don't have enough money. I shouldn't skip the big blind; winning could help fund the reroll.\n**Planning for chips**\n\nI need 70,000 chips to face the boss, and I think my current build might handle it, but the face-down effect leaves me uncertain. It seems wiser to play the big blind first and then aim to gather money or a voucher in the shop to prepare better. Skipping the big blind for a free uncommon joker could help, but without the shop access beforehand, it won't benefit me against the boss. I think I'll go ahead and play the round. Also, I should consider the order of jokers for scoring, especially since it might matter!\n**Analyzing scoring triggers**\n\nI need to figure out how the order of jokers affects scoring. Supernova adds its multiplier based on hands played, while Constellation does the same as an independent joker. Scary Face triggers after scoring for face cards, and Pareidolia alters the face card property. It seems that Scary Face activates for each face card, providing chips when scored. Pareidolia should apply before Scary Face because it alters face detection; however, its effect is static and might not depend on order. Constellation's multiplier activates after scoring, suggesting it should come last among the independents.\n**Maximizing multiplier order**\n\nTo maximize the xmult, the order of multiplication doesn't impact results except when it comes to additive ones. If I have both a +mult and xmult, the addition needs to happen before the multiplication for the best outcome. I should ensure that Constellation's xmult happens after any additive jokers like Spare Trousers and Supernova. Since my current order has them set correctly, I think I'm good. Now, I need to focus on playing the big blind to build up my funds for later. Even aiming for a quick win can help me reach the $10 needed for a boss reroll!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
