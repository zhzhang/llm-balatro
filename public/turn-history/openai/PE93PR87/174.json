{"reasoning":"**Evaluating the Moon sell-off**\n\nI’m considering selling the Moon to have $11 for interest, but then I realize interest doesn’t matter before the boss round? If I keep the $11, I get $2 in interest, just like with $10. Selling the Moon might not be worth it. However, I wonder if it can help with certain bosses, especially if they debuff specific suits like \"The Club.\" It seems like Moon could be beneficial in creating a flush for some bosses.\n**Analyzing boss debuffs**\n\nI realize there are several bosses that debuff different suits: The Window for diamonds, The Head for hearts, The Arm decreases hand level, and The Club debuffs clubs. Moon can turn cards to clubs, which could be risky if clubs are debuffed. Selling Moon gives me $1, but keeping it allows for flexibility to convert cards, possibly avoiding debuffs. If hearts are debuffed, converting to clubs could be a good strategy. So, I think I’ll keep it. Now I need to output this in Action JSON.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
