{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shopping decision**\n\nI'm considering whether to buy the spectral pack for $4 since it's the only option available. It could provide powerful cards like Ankh and Hex, but it might also harm my deck. The pack can be used immediately without taking up a slot. My current build relies on stacking with components like Spare Trousers and Splash foil, but I need stronger scaling for the ante 4 boss. I could risk losing all my money now, but if I win the round, I’ll earn back my investment.\n**Deciding on spectral pack purchase**\n\nI'm realizing that spending all my money is risky, but survival is more important. The spectral pack could provide immediate benefits, possibly upgrading cards or adding a joker slot. Sure, there’s a risk it might destroy a random card, but I think I can manage that. We have glass and steel tarots already, and the pack could include beneficial cards like \"Cryptid\" or \"Trance.\" Considering the upcoming boss, it might be worth the investment, so I'll decide to buy the spectral pack.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
