{"reasoning":"**Calculating poker scoring**\n\nI'm at a small blind Ante of 7, needing 35k with 14,103 chips after one hand. I've got four hands left to gain 20,897 more chips. A decent hand could help, maybe two pairs or a full house. Right now, I have four hearts, so I could go for a flush. Also, I can make a high card with the Ace and face cards for extra chip value, considering scoring multipliers too. It looks like every played card counts in scoring, which is interesting!\n**Analyzing poker scoring with Splash**\n\nOkay, I realize that with Splash, every played card counts in scoring, even those not part of the \"poker hand.\" This means I should focus on the best scoring effects rather than just building a strong hand. Currently, I have a high-card base of 25 chips with a multiplier of 3. I can't make a flush since I only have four hearts. A straight isn’t possible either. It looks like the best hand type I can play will still be a high card, so I should include the Ace for the best outcome.\n**Calculating poker hand scoring**\n\nI’m considering playing an Ace along with the four cards that create the best synergy: a King, Queen, and two even cards, 10 and 4. My hand type will be a high card with Ace as the high card. I calculate a base of 25 chips and a multiplier of 3. With Splash, all cards contribute their chips and effects. I’ve got a potential total of 130 chips factoring in enhancements and multipliers, plus an extra 50 chips from Splash foil. This could be quite a strong play!\n**Examining Splash effects on scoring**\n\nI’m realizing that Splash has a secondary effect that adds +50 chips, which seems to be an independent boost, similar to foil editions. So, if I include that, my total could rise to 180 chips. My base multiplier is 3, but Even Steven adds +4 multiplier twice, bringing my multiplier up to 15. It seems that Spare Trousers and Supernova are separate scoring factors, with Supernova counting how many times a high card has been played in this current run. This gets a bit complicated, but it could have a significant impact on my final score!\n**Optimizing poker strategy with discards**\n\nI’m evaluating my potential play strategies. Spare Trousers grants a +22 multiplier, and along with Supernova, I can boost my multiplier significantly. If I include the additional +50 chips from Splash, I might reach a total of 18,742 chips. It seems better to focus on creating a Two Pair, given its synergy with my enhancements. I have discards available, and it could be safer to discard non-heart cards for a better chance at developing a strong hand. I believe that playing a high card first would still yield good results while leaving room for flexibility in subsequent hands.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [7,6,2,3,4]"}
