{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI'm in a bind here with the decision about skipping the small blind. Skipping gives me a free meteor tag and a celestial pack, which could be valuable. The celestial pack adds planets, enhancing my Constellation scaling. But I'll lose $3, and I wouldn't get to shop, which is a missed opportunity. Skipping means I won't play the round and won't shop either. It's tricky because if I skip, I’ll be stuck in the blind select phase for the big blind decision.\n**Analyzing blind play options**\n\nIf I follow the normal sequence, I would play the blind, then go to the shop before the next blind select. Skipping the small blind means I'd miss that shop, but maybe it’s not a big deal since the shop offerings aren’t great. However, I could get a Meteor Tag that provides a Mega Celestial Pack in the next shop after beating the big blind. I wonder if I can beat the big boss effectively without that small blind $3. I believe I can handle the big blind; after all, I scored around 13-15k against the ante5 boss.\n**Assessing blind strategy for rewards**\n\nI need to gather 20k, 30k, or 40k. With my build improved thanks to Even Steven, I feel confident. If I play the small blind, I’d gain $3, plus potential interest from leftover hands. This could be enough to buy planets or tarot, but I might want to prioritize the tag. If I play the small blind, I might need just two hands to reach my goal, potentially ending with around $9 after interest for the shop. Skipping the small blind would allow me to keep my $2, but I'd get a meteor tag instead.\n**Weighing options in blind play**\n\nI’m considering how much money I’ll have after playing. If I skip the small blind, I miss the $3 and the chance to shop in between, which could hurt. Skipping means I won’t be able to fully scale my Spare Trousers either. However, the meteor tag gives me the opportunity for a valuable mega celestial pack, which lets me choose 2 out of 3 options. It might be worth skipping the small blind to set up for the big blind. But then, there's the holographic tag with its own potential benefits, so I have to weigh that too.\n**Weighing boss battle strategy**\n\nSkipping the big blind leads directly to facing the boss, but missing out on potential rewards like $3 and $4 could hurt my funding. However, the meteor and holographic tags might yield amazing opportunities like a mega celestial pack and a powerful joker. It's a trade-off: if I play small or big, I can scale my strategy better, but skipping might give me the tags I need too. I must evaluate my hand strength and potential multipliers to decide the most efficient way to win against the boss.\n**Evaluating strategy for boss fight**\n\nI’m considering how to optimize my hand for the boss encounter. Using Justice to create a glass card could double my multiplier, which is tempting, but I risk destroying a key card like a king in my two pair. However, focusing on long-term scaling from planets and the celestial pack might be more valuable. If I skip the small blind, I can secure the meteor tag for a mega celestial pack, which boosts my strategy. But playing small first allows for a shop opportunity that might improve my chances against the boss. Ultimately, strengthening my build seems essential for victory.\n**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nI'm calculating my total points: around 33k from previous hands, but I need more for the boss. To improve my scoring potential, I could use Justice to create a glass card that doubles my multiplier. This card can be highly beneficial when scored, especially with splash. However, I have to decide whether to skip the small blind for the meteor tag or play it to gain more money and access a shop. I'm leaning towards skipping the small blind to secure a significant scaling advantage.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
