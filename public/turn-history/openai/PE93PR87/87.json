{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m at the shop, preparing for the boss, with five jokers and one slot open. I've got $18. The shop offers Supernova for $5, Chariot tarot for $3, and some boosters. We initially planned to sell Gluttonous and get Supernova, which still seems like the best choice. Jumbo Celestial could also be worth it for improving my constellation. The most immediate action is to buy Supernova to use up one joker slot. I'm going for it!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
