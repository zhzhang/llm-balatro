{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI can play 5 cards that have scoring effects, which means Scary Face will score a lot since face cards yield +30 chips each. Our deck is full of face cards. The High Priestess can create up to 2 random planet cards that will boost our hand levels and trigger Constellation effects. However, we currently have no consumables and can only hold 2. The High Priestess is a consumable tarot card from the shop, costing $3, so buying it adds to our consumables, allowing for strategic play later on.\n**Evaluating consumable strategies**\n\nI’m considering buying and using a consumable card like High Priestess, which can create planets right away since it doesn’t require targets. But wait, it generates planets directly in consumables, meaning I won’t choose their types. That could be strong! With only $7 available, if I purchase Scary Face for $4, I'd have $3 left to get High Priestess. However, I can take just one action now, so I think I should buy Scary Face first, then plan to get High Priestess later.\n**Deciding action order**\n\nI need to determine the best action now since I can only take one. With $7, I can get Scary Face now, leaving me with $3 for High Priestess next. Alternatively, if I buy and use High Priestess first for $3, I'd have $4 for Scary Face later. Both options are viable, but I wonder if it matters which I do first. The shop state won't change unless I reroll or leave. So, maybe I should go with High Priestess first to get planets, even if it fills my consumables, since I can still buy Scary Face later.\n**Considering action efficiency**\n\nI need to think about my actions carefully. Buying and using the High Priestess to create planet cards seems efficient, but if it fills my max of 2 consumables, I could be blocked from buying more later. However, that's okay because Scary Face is likely valuable for upcoming blinds. I wonder if adding to the joker slots could cause conflicts. Since Constellation and the negative edition both give additional slots, it appears that adding to my jokers won't be an issue, as they won’t take up space.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nIt looks like the negative edition does increase the joker limit by 1, but the card itself takes up a slot—interesting! In the game, negative jokers don’t occupy a slot, effectively raising my max by 1. With 6 joker slots stated and already having 5, I have room. However, rerolling the shop for $5 wouldn’t be wise since that leaves me with only $2. \n\nBuying Scary Face seems straightforward and beneficial, especially with the synergy I have. So, I’ll prioritize that purchase and also consider High Priestess for future planning. Now, I’ll take action and buy Scary Face.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
