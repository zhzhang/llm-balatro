{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchases in-game**\n\nI’m considering using consumables right away since that seems to be the best option. There’s also a voucher for Tarot Merchant that costs $10 and boosts tarot drops, which might be useful. However, we already have Constellation scaling, not tarot. More tarot could enhance our strategy, but we have Justice and other resources.\n\nI’m also thinking about getting boosters. An Arcana pack gives immediate tarot cards, while a standard pack adds a playing card. Rerolling costs $5, so I need to assess that as well. We've got Uranus in consumables, which we could level up for Constellation. Using items now might be smart, but it would take up a slot.\n**Considering Uranus and card strategies**\n\nI’m thinking we should use Uranus to enhance Two Pair's base chips and scale Constellation to x1.6. That feels like the obvious choice! I’ll use Uranus now since planets don’t require targets.\n\nOnce I do that, we can buy Wheel of Fortune and use it right away, or open an Arcana pack. Justice can wait for a card later.\n\nIn the shop, I need to evaluate whether Vampire is better than our current joker. We have plenty of chips and multipliers, so I’m weighing the pros and cons of adding Vampire, but it may strip key enhancements we already have.\n**Evaluating Wheel of Fortune effects**\n\nWith the Wheel of Fortune, I’m thinking it could add an edition to a random joker. But if that joker already has an edition, I’m not sure what happens. Normally, if it has none, it would add one, but if it does have an edition, it might not change anything.\n\nIn Balatro, the Wheel upgrades a random joker. It might reroll to a new edition, but I'm uncertain. To boost my chances, I should aim for non-edition jokers like Ice Cream, Spare Trousers, and Supernova. Currently, I have a 1 in 4 chance of success overall.\n**Planning purchase strategy**\n\nIf I succeed with the Wheel of Fortune, the edition chosen is random among three options: foil, holo, or poly, which have varying benefits. Foil gives +50 chips, holo provides +10 multipliers, and poly has a 1.5x multiplier. Calculating the expected value at 25% leads me to think it's worth around $3.\n\nI have a $10 Tarot Merchant voucher in mind, but I'm leaning more towards the Planet merchant. With $22 available, I can buy the $10 voucher and still have $12 left. I might buy an Arcana pack, a standard pack, and the Wheel, but I need to use actions in order. First, I’ll use Uranus, then buy and use the Wheel, followed by the Tarot Merchant voucher, and lastly, the Arcana pack to fill the consumable slot.\n**Evaluating Arcana and upgrades**\n\nThe Arcana pack allows me to choose one out of three Tarot cards to use immediately, which is fantastic since there's no space issue! Then there's the standard pack that can add a card, but I’m also considering rerolling in the shop for new jokers, though my current inventory is full. \n\nIce Cream is diminishing by 5 per hand, but it still gives +90 chips. However, as antes increase, the chip contributions become less relevant; multipliers are what I need. I already have supernova, spare trousers, constellation, and a polychrome x1.5, so I’m aiming for more multipliers. The shop doesn't offer much besides the vampire.\n\nBuying the voucher and Arcana pack seems wise to maintain some bankroll for future purchases. I also have Luchador as an emergency option to disable a boss. Using Uranus might push Two Pair to level 4, which will give me a base of 80 chips and a 5x multiplier, plus constellation x1.6. \n\nI think the first action should be to use consumable 2.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
