{"reasoning":"**Deciding on a purchase**\n\nI'm thinking about the value of buying an arcana booster since we have spare cash and no other purchases right now. I realize interest mechanics are at play; if I hold onto my cash, I gain interest, but surviving is the priority. Arcana can double my money, so it feels random yet useful. I can’t buy the mega buffoon, and risking my limited queens isn't worth it. I should buy the arcana pack and proceed with that.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
