{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm considering the next move in the shop, where I have $5 to spend. The Tower is $3, and the Buffoon pack is $4, but there's a Wasteful for $10 that's out of reach. I could reroll for $5, but that resets my money. I already have jokers that boost my multiplier, which is a good start. Buying the Buffoon pack for an extra joker seems beneficial for power and economy. However, it might mean I lose interest if I go below $5. The Tower is cheaper but offers less power. I'm torn!\n**Reassessing strategy**\n\nI realized that rerolling for $5 would leave me with no money, which isn't great since I want to keep some cash for interest. I'm considering upcoming blinds, but I don't have that info. Given my strong scoring capabilities from Mystic and Luchador, I can likely clear early rounds. I think I'll go for the Buffoon pack, as it might enhance my economy and scaling. I'll use the buy_booster command to get more jokers. Mystic should be prioritized before Luchador, but it seems they work independently from left to right. I'm curious about how that plays out!\n**Clarifying multiplier order**\n\nI realized that Smiley Face triggers when something is scored, while Luchador gives a 1.5x multiplier independently. The order of operations is important: I'd rather add 15 before multiplying by 1.5. If I started with a base multiplier of 4, I’d be better off adding 15 first, making it 19, and then applying the 1.5x multiplier for 28.5 instead of hitting the 21. So, I’ll prioritize Mystic Summit before Luchador. I’ll go ahead with the buy_booster action and set that up in JSON format.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
