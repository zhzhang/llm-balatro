{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card selection**\n\nI’m considering which high-value cards to apply since we tend to play full house often. For this, we select 5 cards and possibly include 2 bonus cards for extra chips, which adds significantly to our score. We currently have two aces, which is promising. I’ll pick the Hierophant card and target both aces. The command to use will be \"select pack_card_position\" with selected positions [2,1,3]. Sounds like that will work!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,3]"}
