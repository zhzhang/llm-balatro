{"reasoning":"**Clarifying poker card rules**\n\nI’ve noticed how the 9 of diamonds certificate could be significant because it adds extra detail with a seal. It seems this card may create a \"planet\" for the final poker hand if it's held at the start of the round, likely indicated by a blue seal. I need to make sure that if we win that hand, it counts. I wonder if \"held in hand\" means cards must stay with us until the round is scored.\n**Planning card strategies**\n\nI should make sure the sealed 9 remains unplayed during the game. After each hand, the game will draw new cards to refill our hand size, which means the sealed 9 will still be there. During scoring, only the unplayed cards count, so that triggers at the end of the round when there's a final hand. \n\nI need to aim for a win in one shot to generate a planet card, probably \"Earth,\" if I have room for it. I also wonder about using Justice for a glass card to increase multiplier, but maybe I should save it for later since I don't need it yet.\n**Considering discard strategies**\n\nI need to think about discards. The Mystic Summit is most effective with zero discards, but getting there might waste a lot since we’d have to discard four times. Discards don't carry over between rounds, so using them now wouldn't help later. \n\nIt might be worth discarding down to zero for big scoring, especially against a boss. However, with this big blind and no boss, I think I can just play a full house. Mystic Summit only triggers with zero discards, so I could discard four times before playing if I want that scaling and multiplier. But that could consume discards that might be needed later.\n**Evaluating discards and scoring**\n\nIf we win on the first hand, unused discards won’t give us any money, so there’s no point in keeping them other than for flexibility. We could discard four times and still have four hands left, but that might not be necessary and could risk losing the sealed 9. \n\nWait, since discards select cards from hand, we can avoid discarding the sealed 9. Discarding may even set us up for a stronger hand, but we already have a full house. To activate Mystic Summit, we’d need to spend all four discards, which adds a significant multiplier that could help if our current hand is close to winning.\n**Analyzing discards and scoring strategy**\n\nDiscarding four times costs nothing since the discards wouldn't give money anyway. However, it risks affecting our full house unless we keep our key cards, like the sealed 9. I think we can discard non-essential cards while preserving the important ones. If we go down to zero discards, we might activate Mystic Summit, improving our multiplier significantly, but it might take longer to finish in one hand. \n\nSince we have a chance to score big with our current hand after playing, we should just play the full house now instead of risking too much. However, I need to remember that without Mystic Summit active, we might not reach our goal, especially if our valuable cards change.\n**Planning discard strategy for scoring**\n\nWe need to reach 3000 to win, and without Mystic Summit, our full house might not be enough. Using spare trousers could raise our multiplier, but even with that, we'd still fall short. It makes sense to use all four discards to activate Mystic Summit for a bigger multiplier before playing our full house.\n\nHowever, discarding could change our hand, potentially losing the full house. We’ll discard irrelevant cards while ensuring our key cards remain. Discarding the 4 of Hearts seems safest to maintain the full house, and then we'll move forward with our play to maximize our score. Discarding irrelevant cards won't affect our scoring directly, but they could help build a higher multiplier. Also, we might consider using Justice later if needed.\n**Deciding on discard action**\n\nFirst, I'll discard the 4 of Hearts from position 3 since it's a low card. The action to discard will be formatted as JSON, including only the position [3]. After I discard four times, I should have zero discards left, but I’m hoping to draw new cards, keeping the sealed 9 safe.\n\nAlso, I’m considering the order of jokers to maximize multipliers. It seems like I won’t need to rearrange them since the current setup allows Mystic Summit and Spare Trousers to apply before the others. Now, I just need to execute the discard!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3]"}
