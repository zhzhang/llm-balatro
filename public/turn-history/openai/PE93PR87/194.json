{"reasoning":"**Evaluating hand strategy**\n\nI'm considering keeping J, Q, and the gold 2♣. I need around 75k, possibly two hands at about 37k each from previous two pair. I'm aiming for two pair and thinking about discarding 10♠, 4♠, 3♣, 8♦, and 6♦, which might mean choosing to keep just J, Q, and 2♣. Discard positions 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8 look good. I’ve also noted about using consumables later or during the round for thinning the deck.\n**Considering card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking it might be better to evaluate any junk or duplicates before proceeding. Destroying selected cards from my hand is permanent, so I need to be cautious about removing low ranks like 3 and 4. But, I also wonder if I should hold off on too many discards before facing the boss. The last boss needs a joker to be sold, but that's for later. First, I need to focus on the discard action in the required JSON format.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,7,8]"}
