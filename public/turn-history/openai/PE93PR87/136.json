{"reasoning":"**Analyzing gameplay strategy**\n\nI typically consider playing five cards, but maybe four with the Splash mechanic? Splash makes all played cards count but you still need to select cards deliberately. Playing exactly four can work since you need four for two pairs anyway. I could also consider using the Square Joker for scaling chips, but I've only got two antes left, and I'd have to replace a joker, which doesn't seem worth it. \n\nAlright, finding Uranus could enhance my Two Pair while boosting chip gains and multipliers!\n**Evaluating planet packs purchase**\n\nBuying planet packs seems like a solid strategy! Each pack offers a choice of one from three cards, and I can opt for Uranus if it's available, or go for Pluto or similar options. While we might still enhance other hands, our main focus is on boosting our two pair’s base chips and multiplier.\n\nI have $9 to spend, which lets me buy two packs for $8, leaving me with $1. Since I have only one consumable slot and planet cards are used immediately, I should definitely grab at least one pack, maybe even both! However, keeping some funds for the boss fight could be wise since we might want to reroll for a joker synergy. But with the boss approaching, immediate power from planets and Constellation scaling seems more essential! Each planet used increases the multiplier by x0.1; buying both packs could lead to an 11.8% multiplier boost!\n**Planning actions with booster packs**\n\nIt seems I can actually level up two pairs if I manage to get Uranus both times, which would be a significant boost. While it's random, I'm likely to get something beneficial. \n\nI could also consider using Justice to glass a card, but that's not relevant right now since I'm in the shop without a hand to target. The command suggests it enhances a selected card in hand, and since there's no hand here, I can’t use it. \n\nSo, the best action is to buy the first booster pack (celestial). I'll make sure to evaluate the planets I receive afterward. Since I have enough money for both packs, I should buy the first, choose, and then consider getting the second. I'll proceed with the action to buy_booster 1 and respond in JSON format.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
