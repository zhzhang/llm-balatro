{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nI'm considering the impact of the big blind effect. With Mystic Summit providing a +15 multiplier and encouraging early discards, using all my discards each round seems optimal. Although Wasteful might complicate reaching zero discards, I can still discard multiple times. However, having limited discards could create issues. I’m weighing whether to purchase a booster or Tower, as the Tower offers +50 chips, but it also risks losing card rank/suit. Still, that chip boost is significant!\n**Evaluating card contributions**\n\nI'm thinking about a card that gets played often but isn't essential for a hand, like an off-suit card. However, it only counts if it’s part of the scoring hand. A stone card has no rank or suit, so it can’t help form hands. It might barely be included if allowed by certain hand types, but for pairs or three of a kind, only those specific cards score. For straights and flushes, all five cards would contribute, but the stone card won’t help with scoring. So, playing it with a pair likely means it won’t score at all.\n**Assessing stone card value**\n\nThe stone card is only useful when playing 5-card hands where all cards contribute, but since it has no rank or suit, it can't actually help form a hand. If I select it alongside four other cards, it doesn’t count toward that hand. However, in Balatro, I can play fewer than five cards. To score with the stone card, I would need to play it alone as a high card. It seems it offers +50 chips and can't be debuffed, which could add some strategic value!\n**Clarifying stone card usage**\n\nThe stone card can’t contribute to hand formation, but if played alone, it acts as a high card. In Balatro, it counts as a high card and gives +50 chips. Typically, stone cards are used to boost chips, even when not part of a hand, but they seem to only score if played as a high card hand. However, high card hands need a rank, and since the stone card lacks one, that makes it tricky. I think they score in actual play when played, despite not being counted in a standard poker hand.\n**Deciding on purchases and strategy**\n\nThe stone card gives +50 chips when played, but it doesn’t contribute to forming poker hands. Although the system prompt suggests it doesn’t score unless part of a highest hand, I think it overrides that, still providing chip benefits when played. Now, I'm considering purchasing either a Celestial pack to level up hands or a Buffoon pack to get jokers, which could create some interesting synergies. With our current funds at $9, I need to balance spending while keeping at least $5 for interest. Buying the Wasteful card seems strategic but requires more planning; selling the Smiley Face for $2 could get us there. I just need to weigh the benefits of keeping high multipliers versus expanding my options.\n**Deciding on upgrades and purchases**\n\nThe Wasteful card adds +1 discard each round, which can help maintain strong hands and support Summit. However, selling Smiley may hurt my multipliers in face-heavy hands. While I want to preserve my money and economy, early spending is also okay. Selling Mystic Summit isn't a solid option, so I’m leaning toward selling Smiley to fund Wasteful. Since vouchers are permanent and potent, I wonder if I should go for one now. I believe I’ll sell Smiley for $2, gaining $11, then buy the voucher, leaving me with just $1. This allows flexibility. Ultimately, I’ll buy the Celestial pack for a potential upgrade while keeping my funds stable. So, the action is to buy the booster!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
