{"reasoning":"**Evaluating big blind options**\n\nI’m considering whether to play big blind or skip to get the D6 tag. Right now, the investment tag gives me $25 after defeating the boss, but skipping means I lose a reward of $4 and potential earnings from other hands. The D6 tag gives me free rerolls in the next shop, which is enticing. However, I currently have only $2, so I’d need to weigh how to best utilize my resources. I’m overthinking it!\n**Considering joker strategy**\n\nWith just $2 right now, I need to weigh my options. Jokers might cost around $4, and I’ll need money from playing big to buy them. If I skip the big blind, I’ll head to the boss with only $2, earning a $5 reward if I win. Playing big could yield $4, plus potential from leftover hands. I think I can win, especially with a full house. Playing big seems better for earning money, so I can still access the shop after.\n**Deciding strategy for the round**\n\nIf I skip the big blind, I can't access the shop, and I would head straight to the boss with only my current funds. Playing big allows me to visit the shop before facing the boss, which could be beneficial for preparing. Even though I have just $2 now, winning with the big blind can give me enough to help buy items afterward. So, it looks like the best option is to play the round. I'll proceed with that!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
