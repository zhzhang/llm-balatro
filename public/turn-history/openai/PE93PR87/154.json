{"reasoning":"**Rearranging jokers order**\n\nI'm considering the order of jokers in a game while I don’t have money or cards right now. I thought about using additive before multiplication to see if that maximizes the outcome. For example, in Balatro, the independent jokers work left to right, and I think multiplication should follow addition. The order does matter, as seen when comparing (base + add) * x versus base * x + add. I'm trying to figure out if some jokers, like Spare Trousers, truly operate independently or not. That might affect my strategy!\n**Analyzing jokers and scoring**\n\nI'm thinking about how independent jokers affect scores and multipliers in the game. It seems likely that they trigger after scoring. For example, Supernova modifies the multiplier based on how many times a hand is played. Meanwhile, Even Steven adds points for each even card scored, which I recognize as happening \"upon scoring.\" So, I should place the +mult jokers first and save the x mult for last. However, I’m unsure if the order of on-scored jokers matters—but it might not, since they are both additive. Rearranging could be beneficial!\n**Reassessing joker order**\n\nI’m realizing that, within the independent stage, the order of jokers matters a lot, especially if we’re looking at x mult per card. I think the best move is to place Constellation last among independent jokers, currently placed fifth. Scary Face, being on-scored, triggers earlier and isn’t independent. Splash might be independent since it affects the whole game and adds +50 chips. So, for the independent stage, the order should be: Splash, Spare Trousers, Supernova, and then Constellation. Their order will influence how they trigger in different categories!\n**Finalizing joker arrangement**\n\nWhen I'm scoring, on-scored jokers like Even Steven and Scary Face are reviewed from left to right, but they won't trigger during the independent stage. In that stage, I need to focus on arranging the independent jokers for maximum effect. The order should be: Splash for +chips, then Spare Trousers, followed by Supernova, and finally Constellation for x mult. Currently, that's how it stands, and it looks correct since Even Steven and Scary Face are ignored. Now I’m wondering if we should go to round select for Ante 7 Round 13!\nI'm considering whether I should sell jokers for money. We’re at a shop after beating the ante 6 boss, and now it seems we’re in ante 7, round 13. I can’t buy anything right now, but selling Even Steven and Scary Face for $4 could help me buy a booster. However, those jokers are key to my strategy. With Two Pair and various multipliers, I might be better off keeping them. Plus, I can earn money from bets in upcoming hands, which feels safer. I think I’ll hold off on sales for now!\nI’m thinking about the order of adding chips and multipliers. It seems that since the final multiplier is what matters, the order I add chips doesn’t really change the outcome. Even if the multiplier increases later, it won’t retroactively affect the chips already added—though it does affect the final score. There’s some complexity with jokers that add to the current multiplier, but I don’t think I need to rearrange anything. My next step should be to proceed with the round select and format that as a JSON action.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
