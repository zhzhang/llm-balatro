{"reasoning":"**Considering strategy for spending**\n\nI'm weighing the options for spending money wisely. I have $5 and can reroll to find planet cards, which could strengthen my base and enhance my constellation. However, I could only reroll once and potentially buy a different card for $3. It seems keeping the $5 is better since I’ll earn interest at the end of the round, especially as I’m about to face a boss. Spending down to $1 wouldn’t yield interest, so I think it's wise to hold onto my money for now.\n**Deciding on actions with money**\n\nIt seems best to keep my $5, potentially for rerolling or buying something later. The immediate action needs to be round_select. I could buy a standard pack, but that would leave me with little—maybe $1 left. Selling Ice Cream might sound tempting for extra cash, but it only gives me $2, and I think keeping those chips for the boss battle is more crucial. Therefore, I'll go with round_select now and prepare to provide the necessary action JSON for that.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
