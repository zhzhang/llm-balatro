{"reasoning":"**Analyzing joker slots**\n\nAlright, so if the hand contains Two Pair, it indeed triggers a Full House, which is great since it gains a +2 multiplier each time. That’s potentially strong for the long term. However, I need to consider which joker to sell to free up a slot. The current jokers include Mystic Summit, Luchador Polychrome, and Constellation. It seems Constellation provides a +1 Joker slot due to its negative edition. If I sell it, it would reduce the max by 1, causing an overflow.\n**Evaluating joker strategies**\n\nOkay, so if I remove the negative joker, the max decreases to 5, but I’d still have 5 jokers after selling it. Constellation currently has a scaling of x1.1, which isn’t huge but it’s something. The Certificate adds a random sealed card each round, which might be useful but unpredictable. The Sly Joker offers +50 chips for pairs, and the Half Joker gives a multiplier for up to 3-card hands. I’m considering if selling the Certificate for $3 would allow me to buy Spare Trousers for $6 without a net cost.\n**Planning joker sales and upgrades**\n\nI realized I have $6, so if I sell a joker, I can buy Spare Trousers. Selling the Certificate gives $3, bringing my total to $9, which allows me to buy the Trousers for $6. However, we don’t necessarily need more money; the real priority is freeing up a slot. Selling the Certificate might be the best option since it doesn’t directly improve scoring. Spare Trousers offer a +2 multiplier for two pairs, which could be beneficial since we often make Full Houses. Buying a booster pack could also help find more planet cards.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI have $6, and I noticed that buying a booster pack for $4 wouldn’t require me to free up a slot, since consumables might go to inventory. However, I’m weighing the options between improving my deck with an Arcana pack or investing in Spare Trousers. If I sell the Certificate, I’ll have $3 left, losing out on interest. But I could also consider selling the Sly Joker instead. I need to figure out the best strategy moving forward!\n**Deciding on joker changes**\n\nSly gives +50 chips, which is nice, but in later rounds, scaling multipliers become more important. Mystic Summit offers a massive +15 multiplier, while the Half Joker provides +20 for 3-card hands. However, I'm mostly playing 5-card Full Houses, so the Half Joker might not trigger often. Since Spare Trousers give a multiplier bonus from accumulated scores, I’m thinking it’s better to swap out the Half Joker for Spare Trousers. I'll sell the Half Joker for $2 and then buy Spare Trousers to enhance my scoring strategy. Let's proceed with that!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [6]"}
