{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card mechanics**\n\nI'm brainstorming about vampire mechanics in relation to scoring enhanced cards. It seems like it removes enhancements only when played, not for those just held. If we leave enhanced cards unplayed, we won't lose the bonuses, but the temptation to play them is strong, especially with Splash in play. Wait, is \"The Wheel of Fortune\" a consumable? It costs $3, adds an edition to a random Joker, and can be played immediately. I've got to consider if we can buy and use consumables from the card section.\n**Considering card purchases**\n\nI'm thinking about using consumables like tarot or planets, and it seems I can use the buy_and_use_consumable command for something that doesn't require targets. The Wheel of Fortune is in the Shop Cards section, so maybe I can buy it as my second consumable. It might be beneficial to purchase it first since it can upgrade a Joker and improve scaling. I have a few Jokers that could use some enhancements. The cost is low, so it feels worth it to try!\n**Evaluating tarot purchases**\n\nI’m considering adding a Tarot Merchant to increase tarot frequency, which might help with Justice and deck modifications. With $22 on hand, after buying the Wheel, I’ll have $19 left. I could buy a voucher for $10, leaving me with $9; an Arcana pack for $4 would drop that to $5, and a Standard pack for $4 would leave just $1. I’m weighing whether to reroll or save for the next shop visit. The Tarot Merchant isn't essential, but it's a decent option. Using these packs could help strengthen my hand build.\n**Planning card strategies**\n\nI’m considering whether to stick with playing two pair for scaling Spare Trousers and enhancing Supernova through times played. This would mean focusing on leveling two pair with planets, which Constellations could also enhance. However, the Tarot Merchant won’t help me with planets, and it seems wise to reroll for planet cards instead. Although the shop doesn't currently have any planet options, I can use Standard and Arcana packs for potential gains. My next step is to execute the buy_and_use_consumable command for the Wheel, so I’ll set that up now.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
