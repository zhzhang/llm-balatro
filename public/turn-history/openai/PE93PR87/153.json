{"reasoning":"**Deciding on consumable usage**\n\nWe're at the shop with no money left and just one consumable, Pluto, to consider. I need to decide whether to use it now or save it. Using Pluto now gives a significant upgrade to my High Card and triggers a bonus even if small. Planets are generally better used right away unless I have a voucher. In this case, it looks beneficial to use Pluto, so I'll go ahead and use it.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
