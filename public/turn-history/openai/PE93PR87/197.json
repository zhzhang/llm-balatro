{"reasoning":"**Maximizing hand potential**\n\nTo maximize our hand, we want to play two pairs, ideally with many face cards. The Splash rule counts all played cards towards scoring, so we're always playing 5 cards. Each face card played gives us a bonus of +30 chips when scored—great news! We need to make sure we form two pairs, preferably with face cards. I'm considering if our deck could be heavy on face cards, but I'm not entirely certain.\n**Analyzing hand scoring**\n\nI've determined that having a two pair is already at level 6, with a base of 120 chips and a multiplier of 7, which is pretty good. While a Full House is at level 5, we typically play two pairs more than trips, so improving three of a kind might not be worth it. For the boss, we might need around 150k, and our two pair scores about 37k. We’ll likely need 3-4 hands, especially considering we have 5 hands due to the Grabber.\n**Planning for the boss encounter**\n\nFor the boss, it looks like we might have 5 hands, which should be enough if we can get each to score around 40k, totaling 200k. However, I'm concerned if the boss might debuff face cards, though that’s unknown. We do have the Director's Cut option to reroll the boss for $10, which we can afford once. \n\nAs for purchases, the Arcana pack at $4 could enhance our scoring with tarot cards like Empress or Justice. But it takes up no inventory, and we can choose from 1 out of 3 cards immediately. The Jumbo Standard adds a playing card, but that's random. The Hone voucher for $10 might be better for the long term, but it may not help right now since we're at the final boss.\n**Evaluating shop purchases**\n\nIt seems that if we beat the boss, we win, so the Hone voucher may not be worth it unless we can reroll the shop to get editioned jokers. But since only specific shop cards are visible, that's a bit tricky. The Hone does increase the chance of finding editioned cards in the shop, but I’m uncertain if that’s a good strategy. \n\nI think the best move is to buy the Arcana pack for a shot at powerful tarot cards, even though it costs $14. We might need to save $10 for a boss reroll, leaving us with just $4. Buying the Lovers or Venus cards could work too, but we’d need to replace a consumable since we don't have room for more.\n**Deciding on consumables and purchases**\n\nSince I already have 2 consumables, I can't buy new cards unless I use or sell one. I'm considering whether to use the Moon or Hanged Man for the boss. Hanged Man can destroy low-value cards, but I can't target hand cards in the shop. It seems that even though I might be able to use tarots in the shop, targeting isn't possible without showing my hand.\n\nGiven the final boss ahead, it might be better to sell a consumable to buy Venus instead, as it doesn’t require a target. Venus will enhance Three of a Kind, which seems beneficial for my strategy. I’m leaning towards buying the Arcana pack for more powerful options, which will leave me with enough for a boss reroll. Thus, I’ll go ahead and buy the Arcana pack.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
