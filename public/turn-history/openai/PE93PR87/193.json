{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nIf we defeat the boss, we win the game, so money might not be a priority. However, if there's something in the shop that can help us beat the boss, we might want to buy it first. Skipping big purchases could mean less power against the boss. The interesting part is that all cards are debuffed until we sell a joker, and it seems we might need to do this in the shop, not during the boss round.\n**Analyzing boss strategy**\n\nThe boss states we must sell a joker to nullify its effect. I realize that even during a blind select, the command to sell a joker is available. So, it seems strategically smart to sell a weak joker before facing the boss to avoid debuffs. We can earn $4 in the current blind round, but with consumables full and no funds, I wonder about the investment tag. Even if the game allows continued play after beating 8 bosses, our goal remains to win before that point, so I’m not sure the investment is necessary.\n**Planning round strategy**\n\nI think it’s smarter to play big blind to earn money before facing the boss, allowing me to shop for a better joker or planet. I need to remember that using Popcorn decreases the multiplier by -4 per round played, which affects my strategy. After the ante 8 round, my multiplier might drop to +8 from a starting +12. Luckily, I have strong chips like two pair at level 6 with a scaling multiplier. Each played card contributes to scoring, even the kickers, which is an exciting feature!\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m considering whether all played cards factor into the scoring hand, even though the best 5 cards determine the base hand. It seems likely this could amplify face chips and multipliers, allowing for significant scoring. I need to accumulate 75k in big blind, which might take 2-3 hands, but my last two pair hand got me 37k. For the boss, I’ll need 100k. However, if my cards are debuffed, they won't add their chip values or enhancements, but I think jokers could still trigger due to face cards played.\n**Considering strategy before boss battle**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how debuffed cards will behave. They seem to lose their chip value and abilities, but face cards may still count toward scoring, even when debuffed. Since we need to sell a joker to lift the debuff, I think it makes sense to sell the weakest joker before facing the boss. I could also play big blind first to earn money and possibly buy other items for the boss fight, avoiding skipping the hand to keep Popcorn's value higher. However, skipping the big blind could keep Popcorn steady at +12, which might also be vital!\n**Deciding on blind strategy**\n\nIf I skip the big blind, I won’t be able to use the Hanged Man to thin for the boss. But I can use consumables during the boss round, so that’s not a significant issue. Playing the big blind might help scale my Spare Trousers, currently adding +32 multipliers when I play two pairs. However, skipping would keep my Popcorn at +12, which could be valuable. I should probably play the big blind for the extra cash, even if it means a minor Popcorn reduction. It seems I’ll also have a chance to buy a replacement joker before facing the boss, which is a solid strategy.\n**Evaluating the selling strategy**\n\nI’m not certain if I can sell during the boss round. The sell_joker command is available in my current state, and it might still be accessible during the boss fight. If I sell Popcorn at the start of the boss round, I’d lose its multiplier anyway, so its preservation doesn’t matter. I think playing big is the better choice, as it gives me the option to go to the shop to buy a replacement joker after selling. So I’ll proceed with playing big!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
