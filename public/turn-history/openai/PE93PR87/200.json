{"reasoning":"**Evaluating final boss mechanics**\n\nI’m facing the final boss, and all cards are debuffed until a Joker is sold. This raises the question: can we navigate a round without selling one? Sure, we could play, but the debuffed cards lose chip values, enhancements, and seals. However, jokers seem unaffected by the debuff. But my engine relies on card chips and face card triggers, which may complicate things. If face cards are debuffed, do they still function normally? Their abilities might be disabled, yet they remain designated as face cards.\n**Analyzing joker mechanics**\n\nI’m considering how triggers linked to scoring face cards might be seen as the joker's ability rather than the card itself. Even though the card is debuffed, it could still theoretically score. The rules state that debuffed card abilities and chip values are disabled, but I think the card can still participate and contribute to hand types. While its chip value would be 0, jokers likely still trigger effects based on scored cards. It's puzzling, especially under the boss's rule that all cards stay debuffed until one joker is sold.\n**Evaluating boss mechanics and strategies**\n\nI’m realizing I’m dealing with \"The Psychic\" boss, which debuffs all cards until one Joker is sold. But there are other bosses too, like \"The Arm\" that reduces levels and \"The Mouth\" that plays only one hand type. The goal is to sell a Joker beforehand, which I think can happen during the blind select. We need to reach 100,000 chips, and our previous hands were around 37,000 with cards not debuffed. Selling a less useful joker might be the best move to enable normal play. Selling does lower scoring potential, but it’s necessary to reach our goal.\n**Calculating baseline chip values**\n\nI want to compute a baseline with all jokers included. For two pairs, I'm looking at a base of 120 chips with a multiplier of 7 at level 6. The Spare Trousers give an extra +32 multiplier and gains +2 for each two-pair combination. There's also the Popcorn effect, which starts at +8 but decays by -4 each round. If we're currently in round 18, Popcorn's effect might have reduced. I need to check the current multiplier information. For Splash effects, the foil edition provides an additional +50 chips, while the base effect is none. It's important to clarify these details!\n**Assessing joker contributions and strategy**\n\nI’m evaluating the contributions of my jokers, noting that contributions are independent. Scary Face adds +30 chips per face card scored, while Smiley Face gives +5 multiplier for every face card. Popcorn offers +8 but decays over rounds. With the current boss debuffing all cards until we sell a joker, we need to choose wisely. Selling Popcorn might seem to make sense since it has the lowest contribution, but I’m considering the trade-offs regarding our overall scoring potential for the final boss.\n**Evaluating joker effects and scoring**\n\nI’m assessing the contributions of my jokers towards chip totals. For example, Splash and Smiley foil both add +50 chips. Scary Face contributes +30 chips per face card, so if I have around 4 or 5 face cards, that could add up nicely. However, it seems my preliminary calculations might be off—recorded scores indicate lower multiplier or chips than expected. I’m leaning toward selling Popcorn, as it has the least impact overall, to lift the debuff and allow normal play. Following that, I need to consider the best arrangement of my remaining jokers to maximize scoring, though I can't change their order during the current round.\n**Deciding on card order and actions**\n\nI'm thinking through how to maximize the impact of my joker cards. With multiple glass cards, the later ones can double the multipliers set by earlier cards like Smiley. I really need to get the play order right! Right now, I should sell Popcorn since it seems less valuable, and after that, I can rearrange my jokers for optimal scoring. So, my next action is to sell Joker position 4, and I will set that up in my JSON.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
