{"reasoning":"**Analyzing joker options**\n\nI’m considering the Wasteful joker, which can discard a card each round, valuable for creating two pairs or a full house. With an ante of 6, we have $14, and buying Wasteful for $10 leaves us with $4. That feels strong. \n\nThen there's Even Steven, boosting odds with +4 multipliers for even-ranked cards. We play five cards each hand, so focusing on even ranks could be big. However, this would require selling a joker, possibly Ice Cream, which currently gives +80 chips. But Even Steven’s multiplier might be better long-term. \n\nLastly, Wily Joker seems less useful since we mainly play two pairs, not three of a kind.\n**Evaluating Even Steven's benefits**\n\nI’m considering that Even Steven could be beneficial since we already have many even ranks, but I need to check the deck composition first. I could incorporate 10s, 8s, 6s, 4s, and 2s. If I get a two pair with even ranks, I might have all five cards be even, resulting in a +20 multiplier, which is a big deal! \n\nWith Splash, it seems that all played cards count for scoring, even those not part of the best hand. So, Even Steven would trigger modifiers for all even cards played, regardless of how they’re used in the hand.\n**Considering hand strategies**\n\nIt's clear that having the ability to play any hand, with even kickers for multipliers, is strong. However, I still need the best hand for base chips. With two pairs, I can use five cards, possibly even using odd ranks with even kickers. Two pairs require four cards, leaving just one kicker.\n\nWith Splash, that kicker would still score and activate Even Steven. Alternatively, I could play a pair with three even kickers to get a multiplier, but the base hand would be lower. Selling Splash is an option, but it has the benefit of counting all played cards. Ice Cream is independent and adds +chips too, which complicates the decision!\n**Evaluating Splash and Supernova**\n\nThe Splash foil gives +50 chips independently, which is great since the main ability allows all played cards to count, enhancing chip accumulation and scoring with multipliers. I've already got the King of Clubs for a multiplier boost. Keeping Splash makes sense since its kicker triggers multipliers.\n\nAs for Supernova, it adds the number of times a poker hand is played to the multiplier. Since we often play two pairs, it currently adds +5, which isn’t huge but can scale. It’s nice, but perhaps not worth keeping if bigger boosts are available!\n**Planning card purchases**\n\nAlright, I see that the Spare Trousers give +14 and scaling with two pairs. With Luchador, the secondary multiplier adds to its effectiveness. Keeping these makes sense. Ice Cream's +80 chips will decay over time, and it’s valuable now but might not last.\n\nSelling Supernova to fund Even Steven sounds attractive, especially since it could yield +8. However, Supernova scales with usage, which is nice. \n\nMaybe I should buy the Wasteful voucher first, then consider the Jumbo Arcana pack to enhance my deck, even if it requires selling Supernova. That could give me solid improvements!\n**Deciding on the first action**\n\nI see that I'll need to select one of five tarots after purchasing, but I won't know the pack contents until after I buy it. Since I can only take one action at a time, I think the best step is to buy the Wasteful voucher now. It feels like a safe choice that will set me up for the next decision in this game. So, my action is: buy_voucher 1 (Wasteful).\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
