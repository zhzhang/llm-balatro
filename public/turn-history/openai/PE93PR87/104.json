{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI need to decide what to do at the shop. We've sold Mystic, leaving us with 5 jokers and $11. The options are: Shoot the Moon for $5, Ice Cream for $5, Mega Buffoon for $8, Arcana for $4, and a Tarot Merchant voucher for $10. I’m noticing that Ice Cream provides a consistent +100 chips, which seems strong. Shoot the Moon has a risky multiplier and could be less reliable compared to Ice Cream.\n**Deciding on shop purchases**\n\nI need to consider my shop options carefully. Buying the Tarot Merchant voucher would leave me with just $1, preventing me from getting Ice Cream. The voucher might synergize well with Justice for deck improvement, but I’m at Ante 5/8 and need to boost my chips quickly. I think buying Ice Cream for $5 first is best, leaving $6 for an Arcana pack for $4. That way, I can focus on scaling my chips effectively without exceeding my joker limit.\n**Analyzing purchase options**\n\nIce Cream is a solid choice, and the Arcana pack could potentially offer powerful cards like The Hermit or Death, which wouldn't take up a slot. With $6 left after buying Ice Cream, I could grab the Arcana and possibly reroll, although that costs $5. \n\nI’m considering the Tarot Merchant for long-term benefits, but with only $11, I’d have to sell Justice for $1 to afford it. So many moving parts! I need to ensure I score above 10k soon to keep up.\n**Considering Ice Cream benefits**\n\nIce Cream offers an incredible +100 chips each hand, which, combined with our multipliers, could yield thousands. The decay is manageable since it only reduces by 5 chips with each hand played, and we often win in one hand. So, my action will be to buy Ice Cream. \n\nNext, I should think about arranging the jokers since the order matters for independent multipliers. Spare Trousers and Supernova seem to trigger different effects, and I believe they contribute to my overall chip gain!\n**Setting up scoring order**\n\nI realize that every played card affects scoring and determines which cards trigger, so the order is essential. The +50 chips from Splash is independent, but I need to arrange my additive and multiplicative jokers correctly for the best results. The optimal order will be: Splash, Ice Cream, Spare Trousers, Supernova, then Constellation and Luchador last. Since I’ll have 6 jokers after the purchase, I can rearrange them next turn. For now, my action is to buy Ice Cream. Let's go ahead with that!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
