I have $10 and no jokers yet. The upcoming big blind is $450, and I could skip it to get the Polychrome Tag. Our plan was to play small but skipping the big blind might lead to a loss of shopping options later. I'll still have the chance to shop after the boss, but I'll need jokers for that boss round since the boss discards two random cards each hand.\\n**Analyzing purchasing options**\\n\\nShould I buy something now to help against the boss? It seems like a good idea! Mystic Summit offers a +15 multiplier when no discards remain, which is strong if I need to burn discards. Since the boss discards two cards per hand without consuming my discards, I should use them effectively. Another option is leveling Two Pair with Uranus, but enhancing my hand could be beneficial early on. However, buying booster packs for jokers might be smarter, like the Buffoon pack for jokers or the Celestial pack for planets, plus I could use a voucher for the Magic Trick to buy cards.\\n**Considering the purchase strategy**\\n\\nIt might not be crucial to spend all my money early since I wouldn't have any left for jokers, but it could pay off in the long run. I'm focused on surviving the boss first and grabbing that Polychrome Tag for a free base joker later. Buying a joker now seems smart, but I also need to think about interest, which is tricky since skipping the big blind means I wouldn't earn rewards. I think I should buy the Buffoon pack for jokers and consider Mystic Summit as well. With $10, I can purchase both for $9 and still have $1 left.\\n**Evaluating Mystic Synergy**\\n\\nMystic Synergy seems like a powerful option since it offers a +15 multiplier after using all my discards, which is huge early on. The only catch is that I have to spend all my discards each round. Even though I might need discards for the boss, I could discard four cards right away to hunt for a strong hand. Sure, random discards after each hand could disrupt my strategy, but if I can win quickly with Mystic and jokers, it could really pay off. Alternatively, I could buy the Celestial Pack for a planet, but I think jokers are a better choice for now.\\n**Planning purchases**\\n\\nI could buy Uranus to enhance my Two Pair, but I think I\\u2019ll focus on getting Jokers first. Mystic Summit seems like a solid buy, along with the Buffoon pack. I need to choose one action at a time; Mystic Summit for a Joker might be best, but opening Buffoon first could offer an even better Joker option. Since I'm dealing with slots, I should definitely prioritize Buffoon, which can show two Jokers for me to pick from. After buying Mystic for $5, I\\u2019ll have $5 left, allowing me to still get Buffoon for $4 and have $1 remaining. This also helps keep some money for future rerolls. Buying Mystic now seems worthwhile, so I\\u2019ll go ahead and do that.\\n\\nCommand: buy_card 1\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SHOP\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Mystic Summit.

Mystic Summit can help if I use all discards. The boss discards two random cards per hand, which complicates planning. However, I can still win with a basic full house. Given a $5 budget, buying the Buffoon pack seems best to get another joker for future challenges. While skipping big buys may seem risky, buying Buffoon now feels like a solid decision. Levels from early runs could help too.\\n**Deciding on card packs**\\n\\nThe Celestial pack offers immediate planet options, like a full house, but the Buffoon pack might provide better scaling. With $5, I can either buy one $4 booster or go for Uranus at $3, leaving $2. Buying Buffoon for $4 leaves me with $1, which means low interest at the end of the next round. Survival is the priority here, so I\\u2019ll buy the Buffoon pack. After that, I can choose from up to two jokers.
