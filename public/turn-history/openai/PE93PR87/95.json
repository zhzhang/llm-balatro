{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI’m considering if the draw allows for a full house first hand; if not, we could use alternatives like two pair or three of a kind, but those likely won't score enough. A full house is really what we want. Factors like the boss effect prevent repeating hand types, which matters only if we need multiple hands. I could enhance the full house with Justice glass for a multiplier, but I need to think about timing on using these consumables.\n**Deciding on gameplay strategy**\n\nI'm weighing my options and deciding to play a round. I could consider selling Luchador to disable the boss effect, trading that x1.5 multiplier for the chance to repeat a full house if multiple hands are needed. Currently, I think I have up to six hands because of the grabber, but I need to verify. It might be worth disabling the boss effect to safely aim for multiple full houses, especially if the first hand doesn’t score high enough. But losing the multiplier could hurt my overall score too.\n**Evaluating full house potential**\n\nLet’s estimate: previously, I scored 10,358.4 with Luchador's x1.5 multiplier. If I sell Luchador, my score would drop to 6,905.6, which is below the 10k threshold. However, I could do two full houses and potentially exceed 10k. Disabling the boss lets me play full house multiple times, and even with a score of 6,905 for each, I'd easily surpass 10k. I’m weighing the trade-off between losing the multiplier and the chance for repeated plays. Keeping Luchador might be safer if I can draw a full house quickly.\n**Exploring discarding strategy**\n\nThe boss restricts repeats but allows the first try, which is good for attempting a full house with discards. If I fail and need to play something like three of a kind, I might waste a hand type and not score much. However, I can discard heavily to assemble a full house without playing other types since discarding doesn’t count as a hand type in a boss round. I don’t think I need to disable the boss; using discards effectively can help me beat the round with a strong multiplier!\n**Planning for Mystic Summit**\n\nI’m realizing that Mystic Summit activates when there are zero discards, so it might be wise to use all discards before playing to gain that +15 multiplier, which is typically the strategy I follow. With that in mind, the best course of action is to play the round now. I need to respond with a JSON action: \"play_round,\" and I’ll leave positions as null for this move. Time to execute the plan!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
