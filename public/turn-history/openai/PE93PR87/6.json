{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy against the boss**\n\nI'm questioning whether skipping could put me at a disadvantage against the boss. The boss requires 600 chips and discards two random cards each hand, likely before play. Without the big blind reward and only having $1 and two jokers, I'm considering if I can still win. It seems possible to beat the boss in four hands if I strategize right. Skipping might let me go straight to the boss, but it may limit my next shop's options.\n**Considering risks and benefits**\n\nI think skipping the shop before the boss could have some benefits, but I'd miss out on $4 and potential upgrades. The ante1 boss seems manageable with my base deck and current jokers. I previously scored 368 with a full house in the small blind, but I’m not sure if I used discards then. To reach 600 chips, I might need two hands at 368 each, and I'll aim to manage the random discard effect by focusing on pairs or three of a kind. Plus, I can trigger Mystic Summit by using all my discards early.\n**Analyzing boss strategies**\n\nI realize that the boss discards random cards per hand, which complicates planning. However, I might just focus on playing the strongest cards available while using discards to trigger Mystic Summit. Skipping the big blind means we lose out on that extra $4, but the strong tag could outweigh that loss. It's likely safer to skip, as the tag could prove more valuable than immediate shop opportunities. I could buy a joker with just $5 after playing big blind, but skipping could lead to a more beneficial polychrome joker later.\n**Deciding on the ante1 strategy**\n\nI'm considering the situation at ante1 where the boss requires 600 chips, which seems quite manageable. Plus, having two scoring jokers definitely helps. Therefore, my decision is clear: I should skip the round to optimize my chances. By doing so, I can focus on building my strategy without risking unnecessary losses. Skipping feels like the right action here!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
