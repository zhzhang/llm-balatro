{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nI need to choose my next shop action with $4. The options are to buy Even Steven, Wily Joker, or the Standard Pack. I can't afford the arcana at $6. With 6 jokers, I need to sell one before buying. Even Steven seems good for scaling with even cards, while Wily Joker only helps with a Three of a Kind. Overall, Even Steven looks like a better choice, but I’ll need to decide which joker to sell first!\n**Evaluating core cards**\n\nRight now, my core includes Spare Trousers for scaling and the Constellation for a multiplier and extra slot. Luchador helps by giving a nice multiplier and can disable a boss if needed, so I’ll keep it. Splash is key for scoring and boosting chips, especially with Even Steven. Ice Cream offers decent chips but decays; it might be better to sell it for Even Steven and focus on that potential multiplier with even cards. Supernova adds scaling based on played hands, which could be useful too!\n**Considering even cards and multipliers**\n\nI’m averaging 2-3 even cards per hand, which could lead to a +8 to +12 multiplier, pretty strong for scaling! Scoring comes into play for each even card, and the multiplier adds up with our existing multipliers. I definitely want Even Steven. For that, I need to sell a joker; I’m leaning towards Ice Cream or Supernova. Supernova grows with hand type, which is nice, but with my spare trousers already giving a solid +14, Supernova's contribution seems less impactful. Ice Cream does add base chips, though.\n**Deciding on selling Ice Cream**\n\nI’m thinking of selling Ice Cream since its value is diminishing. It does help when I have low base chips, but I already have a strong overall multiplier. Let’s estimate: in a typical hand, I could start with 80 base chips, plus around 50 from Splash and potentially 80 from Ice Cream, giving me 160 chips. With a multiplier of about 24, that would mean roughly 9216 chips total. However, if I switch to Even Steven, I might lose those additional 80 chips from Ice Cream. I’ll have to recalculate how all that stacks up!\n**Finalizing my strategy**\n\nI'm calculating multipliers with and without Even Steven: without it, I have a mult of 24, but adding Even Steven bumps it to 36. The chip totals show that Even Steven would likely perform as well or better than Ice Cream. I think I should sell Ice Cream and buy Even Steven. \n\nHowever, I could also consider the Standard Pack for $4 to add a card to my deck. But since Even Steven is currently available, it'll be my priority. I'll execute the action to sell Ice Cream first. \n\nSo, let’s go with {\"action\":\"sell_joker\",\"positions\":[2]}!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
