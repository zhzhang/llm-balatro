{"reasoning":"**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI'm considering my shop budget of $7. I've sold the Even Steven, leaving me with 5 jokers and one slot available. The available items include The Sun tarot for $3 and the Pareidolia joker for $5, along with boosters like arcana at $4 and a jumbo at $6.\n\nMy build focuses on maximizing synergy with cards like Splash and Pareidolia, which would grant significant chip bonuses when used together. I decide that I must buy Pareidolia for $5, leaving me with $2. The Sun tarot isn't necessary since it doesn’t fit my strategy.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m weighing my options for spending the $7. I considered buying the jumbo arcana for $6, which might be useful, but I realize a tarot really only offers temporary benefits. \n\nPareidolia, on the other hand, seems like a more permanent and advantageous buy, so I decide to purchase it for $5.\n\nWith my remaining $2, I can't buy The Sun for $3, and I can't reroll. So, I’ll firmly go with my plan to buy Pareidolia.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
