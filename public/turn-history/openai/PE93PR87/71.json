{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m leaning towards choosing The Devil for its continuous economic benefit. I need to decide which card to turn into gold—ideally, one we keep in hand. We often play all five cards in a full house, but maybe we could focus on a low-ranking card. I realize a gold card gives $3 if it's unplayed in hand at the end of the round. So, I should aim for a card like the 2 of spades or something random, while balancing our discards for Mystic Summit.\n**Deciding on card strategies**\n\nI want to eventually use all discards, and keeping one card unplayed is fine. Converting cards like Sun/World could help with flushes, but they’re not very effective. I’m thinking about using The Devil and targeting the lowest value card to convert into gold, perhaps the 2 of spades, since it gives +2 chips. The gold card doesn’t add extra chips; it seems like it keeps the base chips of rank but replaces enhancements. Losing low chips with the 2 of spades won't matter much since we won’t play it often. By the way, the Ace of Clubs can create tarot when discarded, provided we have room.\n**Deciding on card discards**\n\nI think we might want to discard certain cards to gain more tarot, but making a card gold could reduce the need to discard it. The gold card gives $3 if held at the end of the round, which is tempting but not as beneficial as the tarot gain from discarding. The King of Clubs is valuable, so I won’t convert that. Instead, I’ll use The Devil on the 2 of spades. Now it's time to proceed with selecting the card in the specified format. I'll select it as my target!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1]"}
