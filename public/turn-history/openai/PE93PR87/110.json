{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to play or skip the big blind ante. I have $10 after skipping the small blind. If I skip the big, I get a free uncommon joker, but then I head straight to the boss without a shop in between. The boss battle will be tough since all Diamonds are debuffed. If I decide to play the big blind, I could earn a $4 reward and access the shop before the boss. It’s a tough decision about the risk of free resources.\n**Assessing purchase options**\n\nI have $10 and can buy items in the shop if I play the big blind, which seems like a good strategy. But currently, we're at blind select, so the shop isn't open until after the round. If I play big, I might earn more money, but the ice cream decays with each hand. To reach 16,500, I might need to play two hands. I'm weighing multipliers like splash chips and others, but skipping the big isn't reducing the threshold, and the boss still needs 22,000. It feels complex!\n**Considering strategy for boss fight**\n\nI have the option to sell Luchador to disable the boss's blind effect, which weakens Diamonds. However, reaching 22,000 requires a strong hand. I think I should play big to access the shop before facing the boss so I can buy planets to enhance Constellation and possibly get a good joker. If I play big and win, I'd gain a $4 reward, likely enough to prepare. However, skipping gives a chance at a free uncommon joker but risks failing the boss without upgrades. It's a tricky situation!\n**Calculating multiplier effects**\n\nIce Cream adds chips but doesn’t contribute to my multiplier scaling, which I really need. My spare trousers give a +8 multiplier, activating permanently when I hit a two pair. The Supernova increases its bonus based on how many hands I've played, so that’s a +7 for a full house and +2 for two pair played. Constellation and Luchador both provide a 1.5x bonus. The base multiplier for a full house at level 3 starts at 8, but does it get that +2 from the spare trousers if my winning hand contains a two pair? Yes, a full house does include two pairs!\n**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nSo, it looks like the spare trousers activate and provide +8 multiplier, which increases by +2 when I have a two pair. This means it can help reach +10. Four of a kind can indeed form two pairs, so that counts too! I need to maximize my chips by playing five cards since every played card contributes to scoring, enhancing my overall gain. I'm calculating potential chips from various bonuses, and playing big blind seems crucial. Skipping could risk missing useful upgrades, but it might save me from ice cream decay too. I need to be strategic!\n**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nI need to reach that 22k threshold, and I could use Justice to make a glass card for a x2 multiplier, which might help. However, playing big seems essential to ensure I can defeat the boss. If I win with one hand, I'll have $21 afterward due to the rewards and interest. But skipping the big blind would mean going to the boss with just $10 and risking a loss. \n\nConsidering the value of a shop before the boss, it seems better to play the big blind. So, I’ll respond with play_round and set my intended hand type to a full house!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
