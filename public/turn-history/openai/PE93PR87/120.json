{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card editions and strategies**\n\nI'm looking at at least three eligible joker editions—Splash foil, Constellation negative, and Luchador polychrome. The ice cream base, spare trousers base, and supernova base are also considered. With a 25% success rate for getting a random edition, the expected value seems modest, although there are good multipliers for polychrome, holo, and foil cards. The Hanged Man card can thin out the deck but might not be needed right now. I'll need to scale powers for Ante 5 onwards and consider how best to utilize the Empress for additional multipliers.\n**Selecting card enhancements**\n\nI'm examining the card enhancement process, where I can enhance two selected cards from my hand. I should choose wisely to maximize multiplier effects. For instance, I'd pick the Ace♦, as its high chip value of 11 and discard-create tarot make it a great choice without interfering with the multiplier. The Queen♠ or an 8 could be alternatives if focusing on chips. However, I need to be cautious about cards like Steel 5♦ since enhancing it would replace its beneficial multiplier, which isn't ideal. So, I'll avoid that option.\n**Evaluating card abilities and choices**\n\nThe Ace♦ has a special ability to create a Tarot when discarded, and I’m curious if enhancing it to a multiplier keeps that ability. The enhancements shouldn’t remove seals or editions and might be more like overriding effects. Since creating a Tarot seems to function as a seal, rather than an enhancement, I'm thinking it will stay intact when enhanced. I’ll choose Ace♦, and I’m considering pairing it with Queen♠ or one of the 8s, which could help with pairs. I want multipliers on cards I can play consistently, but improving my odds with card thinning later could also help.\n**Considering card selection strategies**\n\nI’m weighing my options: I could focus on high card frequency or choose the Fool to gain another Wheel of Fortune. This could potentially upgrade cards like Supernova or Spare Trousers to Holographic or Polychrome, which would offer significant scaling. The Empress adds +4 multipliers for each mult card played, but that requires drawing and playing them first. Polychrome's effect on Supernova could boost my final multiplier significantly, but it's a risky 25% success chance. The expected value really hinges on these probabilities, especially when choosing among the editions.\n**Deciding card choices for enhancement**\n\nI'm considering how the Wheel of Fortune can randomly choose a joker, like Ice Cream, but that’s temporary and will be sold eventually, which is fine. The Empress is deterministic and can stack with Splash, so I’m leaning toward selecting her. For targets, I’ll likely pick the Ace♦ and Queen♠ for their high base chips. I need to ensure I have consumable slots since selected tarot will be used immediately. I’ll command to enhance Queen♠ and Ace♦ by selecting their positions in my hand. Let’s confirm: select positions 1 and 6. That should enhance the right cards to multipliers!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1,6]"}
