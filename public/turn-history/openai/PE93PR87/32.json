{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nI’m considering selling various items to increase my total, but the money isn't quite enough. Selling Mystic Summit, Smiley, and the certificate could net some cash, but the certificate seems valuable. Alternatively, I could sell Sly, Smiley, and Mystic, which might help me purchase a booster and an egg. However, I might weaken my position. The best move might be to keep things as they are for now and select an approach that supports the next boss challenge.\n**Assessing discard strategy**\n\nI'm wondering how often I can discard. Perhaps I can do it twice each round? Discarding seems precious for building up a full house. The certificate provides random cards, which I might still use while aiming to keep it. Smiley faces work well with face cards, but it’s not guaranteed to get what I want. The Sly Joker seems beneficial for chips, especially early in the game. Selling the certificate for $3 to buy an Egg might be a good move, considering it can yield $3 in sell value later.\n**Analyzing egg purchase decisions**\n\nIf I buy the Egg for $4 now, its sell value might start at around $2 after one round. However, since the sell value increases by $3 each end of the round, it could be worth $5 after the first round. If I sell then, I'd make a $1 profit. After two rounds, it could go up to $8, yielding a $4 profit. But it takes a joker slot, and I have to decide if I want to drop the certificate for this egg option.\n**Weighing economic options**\n\nI’m considering our current financial situation. We're at $1, and while the economy is low, buying an Egg could help. The certificate might generate sealed cards for better scoring, but I think in early rounds, we’re managing okay, even hitting 5940 with a full house. For future rounds, I might need to buy more planets. Selling the certificate for an Egg could pay off later by improving the economy. Alternatively, I could sell Smiley or Mystic to afford a celestial pack for $4, but I'd lose card generation, making it a tough choice.\n**Deciding on purchases and strategy**\n\nI’m weighing whether to buy an Egg for immediate scaling or a celestial pack for long-term power. At $4, I need to consider the boss round coming up. If I hold off on buying for now, I might gain more money later, but I need to decide if shopping after the next blind select is worthwhile. I think keeping the certificate for card generation might be safer, especially with the strong scoring I’ll need for the upcoming boss fight. I really want to optimize my jokers' order for their effects too!\n**Rearranging joker strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about optimizing the order of my jokers. I want Mystic Summit to be first since it adds +15 before Luchador and Constellation multiply my score. The current order is Mystic, Smiley, Luchador, Constellation, Certificate, and Sly. I’m glad Mystic is already first! Luchador will multiply after Mystic adds its effect, followed by Constellation. Sly adds chips, but it won't interfere with the multiplication. Now, I’ll move on to the round select screen and prepare for the boss. I should keep an eye on my money for interest too!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
