{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nIf I skip the big move, I won’t shop, but after defeating the boss, I'll still have a chance to shop. Skipping big means a polychrome tag applies to my next shop, which seems significant. Yet playing small allows me to shop now and buy something useful against the boss, who discards two cards per hand, making it harder. It seems optimal to play small first and then skip big to get that tag. I'll output play_round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
