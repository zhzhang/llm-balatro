{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI see that I need 4000 points, and using Mystic could clear the way if I play it right. To trigger Mystic, I’ll need to have discarded four cards first. But discarding can also help improve my hand, so my plan is to use discards to aim for a full house or four of a kind with aces. I have the Ace of Diamonds in my discard pile, which I might want to hold onto until later to create a Tarot card. However, discarding it reduces my chances of forming that full house. I wonder if using Justice to create the Glass card might be worth it for the score multiplier, even though there's a risk involved. Reliability is key for that high score against the boss.\n**Exploring card scoring strategy**\n\nI can use Justice on a high-value card for my final scoring hand. With Splash, it seems like every played card counts for scoring, which means any card played contributes chips, regardless of whether it's part of my main hand. This is interesting because I can include extra high cards without negatively impacting my hand. I can actually play five cards, and all will score, maximizing my chip count even while making a simple pair of aces. I'm wondering if this strategy could exceed 4000 points with Mystic. Let’s do some estimating!\n**Calculating potential scores**\n\nIf I play A♣, A♦, K♣, J♣, and 10♥, I have a pair of aces. The base chips for a Level 1 Pair are 10 chips with a base multiplier of 2. Since Splash allows all five cards to contribute to the score, I can expect 62 chips total from card values. Adding 50 chips from Splash brings me to 112 chips total. \n\nWith a multiplier of 19, my estimate results in a score of around 3830, which is still under 4000. I need to consider enhancements or cards with seals that could potentially increase my chips. Upgrading to a two pair might trigger additional bonuses, making that a more strategic choice.\n**Clarifying Spare Trousers mechanics**\n\nWhen I have a hand with Two Pair, Spare Trousers gets a permanent +2 multiplier. I'm trying to figure out how this impacts scoring for my current hand. It seems likely that the +2 would trigger before scoring, especially since it mentions it gains that bonus if played. The mechanics seem similar to how other scaling jokers work, which activate before the scoring process. So, if I confirm that Spare Trousers is in the \"on played\" category, I could indeed add that multiplier before calculating my score!\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nSo, I realize that using Justice will give me a +2 multiplier if I play a Two Pair hand, but I’m not going that route right now. A full house might actually score better with a base multiplier of 8 and chips totaling 90, plus extra from Splash. Discarding can help me aim for that full house, but it’s also possible to score high with just a pair and using Glass for a multiplier. I want to time my discarding and maximize my hand's potential while keeping the unknown card in mind, as it can change the dynamic. The ideal plan is to use Justice on a card I plan to keep, perhaps one of the aces, and discard others to create my strongest hand.\n**Strategizing for the boss fight**\n\nBeating the boss is my priority, especially since I’ll earn $30 afterward, which is great for upgrades! I’ll use the Ace of Diamonds to create a tarot, but I don't want to sell Luchador, just in case it's needed. The plan is to discard lower-synergy cards while keeping my pair of aces. I have a hand limit of 9 cards, and I can discard up to 5, so I'll focus on achieving a full house by drawing new cards that can complete my hand while also ensuring I maximize my scoring for the boss. I'll need to decide on the best aces to keep for my final play, using discards wisely to activate Mystic. I’ll strategize by keeping A♣ and A♦, and maybe I’ll discard the unknown and some low-value cards to try for higher ranks!\n**Planning card discards**\n\nI need to manage my discards carefully. Discards replace discarded cards, and since I can only discard up to 5 at a time, my goal is to keep both aces and fill the rest of my hand. I plan to discard the unknown and low-synergy cards, like 8♠, 10♥, 6♥, and 9♦, while keeping A♣, K♣, J♣, and A♦. After discarding, I’ll draw 5 new cards and then reassess my hand before using Justice on a key card. Let's proceed with that plan!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,9]"}
