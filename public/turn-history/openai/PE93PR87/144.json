{"reasoning":"**Clarifying Splash scoring**\n\nI’m realizing that in Splash, every played card counts toward scoring, even those not in the poker hand. This means chips, enhancements, and jokers trigger as well, but the hand type still depends on the best hand. So, we can always play five cards to maximize triggers and use multiple cards effectively. The previous limitation about non-hand cards doesn't apply anymore, which opens up great scoring opportunities. In the current hand, we have a mix including K spades, 6 spades, and others, with even ranks being 6 and 4.\n**Evaluating hand options**\n\nSo, the Ace mult card gives a +4 multiplier when scored, and with Splash, it counts even if it's not in hand. I might want to play all 5 cards, including the ace and even cards. Now, I need to decide on the best hand type from the selected cards. I could play three spades to aim for a flush, but it looks like that's not possible. Since I don't have pairs, a high card seems likely. However, I have five hands and five discards to work with, so discarding could help me find pairs!\n**Deciding on discards for scoring**\n\nIt seems better to discard some cards in order to fish for pairs to aim for two pair or a full house. Typically, two pair can score around 22k, but without Luchador, that’s about 10k. I want to hit 40k within five hands. High cards would score much lower, so discarding now seems essential. As for which cards to keep, I might hold on to the Ace mult card since it boosts multipliers with Splash. But I also need to weigh the risk of using Justice on it for potential benefits.\n**Considering card strategies**\n\nI realize we can include the glass card in the five played cards each time, which is great! Although, it seems we don’t keep it between hands—it gets played and then discarded but can be redrawn later since it stays in the deck. I could create glass on the Ace mult card since it gives a +4 multiplier, and glass doubles that. I wonder if they stack? If the Ace gets destroyed, I would lose that enhanced card, but it could be worth it. Alternatively, I could make glass on the 4 clubs to trigger Even Steven’s +4 multiplier instead.\n**Strategizing card plays for scoring**\n\nPlaying the 6 and 4 gives a +8 multiplier, so focusing on even cards is key. I could use Justice on the 4 or 6 to create glass, maximizing multipliers over chips. Making the 4 glass could yield substantial benefits since it scores every time due to Splash. However, glass cards can be destroyed after scoring, which is risky, especially going into the boss round. \n\nTo reach 40k, I might need two pair hands, aiming for 10k each. If I include glass, I could potentially double my multipliers. We should discard and try to draw for pairs. I want to keep the Ace and the pair of 3s, then discard the others. For maximizing chances, I’ll discard to draw new cards while maintaining a focus on finding that second pair.\n**Analyzing card strategy for optimal play**\n\nIt looks like using the Ace as a filler for +4 multiplier is optimal since making it glass would replace its enhancement, which isn’t ideal. Instead, I should focus on creating glass from one of the 3s, as they form a pair and will be in play. If I turn one of the 3s into glass, I get a +2 multiplier without losing anything. \n\nHowever, keeping the Ace for its multiplier is tempting. I could opt to discard the Ace to generate a tarot card, which could help, but ultimately I want to focus on scoring. I plan to discard the other cards while keeping the Ace and both 3s, allowing for potential two pair draws. I’ll also want to consider how the boss might affect my hand.\n**Calculating optimal strategy for two pair**\n\nI'm thinking about forming the best hand, which would be a pair with 3s if I play 3♠, 3♦, A♦, 6♠, and 4♣. This gives a low multiplier, so I might need to discard. I could use Justice on 3♦ to create a glass card, though there's a 25% chance it could be destroyed when scored. \n\nIf I choose to wait, using glass on one of the 3s makes sense since it can still contribute to a strong two pair. I’m considering how my jokers like Splash, Even Steven, and Spare Trousers can boost my chips and multipliers. But I'm seeing potential discrepancies in my earlier calculations, especially around how Luchador affects my overall score, so I need to clarify those figures to ensure my strategy is solid.\n**Estimating final hand strategy**\n\nI’m analyzing how the secondary x1.5 multiplier and polychrome work; they both multiply the total independently. My earlier hand scoring around 22k suggests I might have miscalculated base chips or multipliers. It looks like, with all bonuses included, my chips would be around 150, and the base multiplier lower, like 40. I’m checking how the Splash joker contributes to the total chips and the impact of played cards in scoring. \n\nI need to ensure my strategy focuses on creating two pairs quickly, considering potential multipliers to optimize scoring.\n**Planning strategy for chip scoring**\n\nI’m strategizing to create two big hands of 20k each. If I make one of the 3s a glass card, it’ll double the multiplier when scoring. My plan is to use Justice on the 3♦ to make it glass, then discard cards while drawing five new ones. \n\nKeeping the 3s gives me a pair, and I’ll evaluate the new hand once I draw. It seems wise to focus on forming a strong hand quickly, aiming to achieve at least a pair. Discarding five cards seems the best move for potential success.\n**Deciding on discard action**\n\nI’ve decided to discard first before using Justice. The plan is to discard cards in positions [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]. This way, I can evaluate the new hand I get afterward. Once I've drawn the new cards, I can decide on my next move. I’ll prepare a JSON response for this action without specifying any intended hand type. Let's get started on the discard!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
