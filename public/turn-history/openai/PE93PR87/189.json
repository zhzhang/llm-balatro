{"reasoning":"**Maximizing card pack choices**\n\nI have $7, and there are tarot packs like the Hanged Man, joker Seance, and booster packs available. I want to maximize my scaling for two pair, maybe adding planets for better hand levels and a Constellation multiplier. The Celestial pack costs $4 and will boost my Constellation multiplier from x2.2 to x2.3 while improving some hand types. Since I aim for two pair often, leveling it helps, but I should focus on planets. The Hanged Man could thin my deck, but I’m unsure if it's necessary.\n**Deciding on a booster pack**\n\nI’ve decided to buy the celestial booster pack for $4. After I open it, I’ll choose the best planet from three options, but I can only execute one command for now. The Seance pack is tempting at $6, but it takes a slot, and I’ll need to sell it later anyway, which doesn’t seem worth it. The Hanged Man could help me discard cards to improve the chances of drawing pairs, but with limited money, I'd prefer the celestial pack. So, I'll go ahead and buy that!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
