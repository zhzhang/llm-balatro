{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop actions**\n\nI need to pick my next move in the shop with only $1. The items available are Lusty for $5, Arcana for $6, a voucher for $10, and a reroll for $5. I can't afford any of them right now. Options include selling something to buy Lusty or saving. After that, it's time for round selection. I also need to rearrange joker orders strategically to maximize their effects, ensuring that additive multipliers come before multiplicative ones.\n**Analyzing jokers’ effects**\n\nI’m trying to figure out the mechanics of jokers in the game. The text states that \"This Joker gains +2 Mult if played hand contains a Two Pair,\" which means it scales and its current multiplier is independent. Spare Trousers starts at +0 mult but increases by +2 when two pair is played, and it applies as an independent multiplier at stage 5. \n\nI think the order of jokers is important for independent triggers, so I'd place them left-to-right: Spare Trousers, Mystic Summit, then the multiplicative jokers like Constellation and Luchador.\n**Evaluating joker order and chips**\n\nI'm trying to make sense of how Splash adds +50 chips, likely at stage 5 where independent jokers contribute chips or multipliers. It seems chips come before multipliers, and their effects aren't influenced by multiplication, which allows me to rearrange the order for maximum benefit. \n\nMy proposed order would be: Spare, Mystic, Splash, Certificate, Constellation, and Luchador. I also need to consider that Constellation gives an extra joker slot, which means I can have a total of six jokers, including that negative effect.\n**Considering buying Lusty**\n\nTo buy Lusty, I’d need $5 and an available slot, which means selling something. Selling would give me money and free up space, but Lusty only adds +3 mult per heart scored. With a full house containing hearts, I might get 2-5 hearts, but that's inconsistent. While Lusty could potentially add +15 mult if all hearts are scored with Splash, it seems Mystic’s +15 is stronger overall. Selling Justice is another option, but I can’t use it if it requires a target in hand, and selling only gives $1.\n**Deciding next actions in the shop**\n\nIf I sell, I'd get $2, which isn't enough for Lusty or Arcana. Selling a joker might help—like Certificate for $3 and Justice for $1, totaling $5, but I'd lose the ability to draw a random sealed card each round. Selling Mystic or Splash doesn't get me enough either. Selling Luchador for $5 could let me buy Arcana, but he provides significant multipliers. \n\nSelling Constellation isn’t wise either, so it seems best to rearrange jokers and then proceed to round selection since buying isn’t an option right now. I think it’s best to optimize joker order and exit the shop.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
