{"reasoning":"**Calculating poker strategy**\n\nI'm in a tricky poker situation with a mid-boss and I need 22,000 chips, but currently, I have only 14,760, so I need an additional 7,240 chips. I have 4 hands and 4 discards to work with, but my hand mainly consists of debuffed diamonds. I need to figure out how to play a hand that scores at least 7,240 chips. Using the jokers and considering their effects is essential, especially since boss debuffs affect my diamonds.\n**Analyzing poker hand options**\n\nI’ve got a current hand with 8♥, Q♣, and 6♣, plus some debuffed diamonds like A♦ and Q♦. The non-diamonds give me 8 chips for 8♥, 10 for Q♣, and 6 for 6♣. I could form a pair of Aces or a pair of Queens, but I can only score with Q♣. However, Splash allows every played card to score, so I'd like to utilize all five played cards—even the debuffed ones, since they just score zero. I’ll consider how to maximize my options with the available non-diamonds.\n**Formulating a Two Pair strategy**\n\nI think my best option for this hand is to go for a Two Pair with A♦, A♦, Q♣, and Q♦, plus either 8♥ or 6♣ as the fifth card. That will trigger bonuses from Spare Trousers and Supernova, giving me a nice chip boost. The base for this Two Pair is 80 chips with a multiplier of 5. Since I can only include one extra card, I’ll go with the highest chip non-diamond, which is 8♥, to add more value to my hand.\n**Calculating total chip score**\n\nI'm looking at my scoring options for the hand. I have a base of 80 chips for Two Pair, plus additional chips from Q♣ and 8♥, which give me 10 and 8 chips respectively. Debuffed cards score zero, but thanks to Splash and Ice Cream, I can add more chips, with Ice Cream giving me another 85. So, my total comes to 233 chips before multiplying. The base multiplier is 5, and considering the Spare Trousers and Supernova effects, I think my final multiplier will be boosted by an additional 4. This should give me a solid score!\n**Finalizing chip calculations**\n\nLooking at my multipliers, it seems only A♦ had a multiplier enhancement, which is now debuffed, so I won't count that. My additive multiplier totals to 21. Then, factoring in Constellation and Luchador gives me some strong multipliers. The final calculation shows that my total multiplier is about 50.4. With my chips at 233, I’m looking at a potential score of around 11,700, which exceeds the 7,240 I need. I'll go for the Two Pair with my planned hand!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
