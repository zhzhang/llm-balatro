{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game options**\n\nI’m considering buying Lusty Joker for $5 but would need to sell one joker to make space. I'm thinking about replacing either Certificate or Spare Trousers. My current build is a full house, which has two pairs. Spare Trousers should indeed trigger here, since it gains a +2 multiplier each time I play a full house. Mystic Summit adds +15 when I don’t discard, and I need to manage discards before big hands. Constellation scales with planets used, and I’m curious about Luchador's scaling effects too.\n**Calculating multipliers**\n\nI’m figuring out the multipliers for the Polychrome edition, which gives a x1.5 boost independently. The Luchador also provides a x1.5 multiplier. So, if I stack them, I think that means a total of x2.25. Both editions apply multiplicatively post-normal multipliers, which is great! Luchador's huge benefit also includes the option to sell it to disable a nasty boss. The Certificate gives a sealed card each round, leading to more scoring later, while Splash rewards +50 chips with every card played. It's fascinating how every played card counts in scoring!\n**Understanding card mechanics**\n\nI’m realizing that I can play up to 5 cards. If I use all 5 for a full house, they’re all in play. If I play fewer than 5, like with a pair, extra cards can score due to Splash. But then, a full house utilizes all cards anyway. Still, I can aim for a pair with three kickers, where Splash makes all 5 cards score. My main strategy is to aim for a full house using Mystic Summit for a big multiplier. With the Lusty Joker adding +3 multipliers for hearts, each heart in the full house scores well, but it’s not always consistent.\n**Assessing strategy for the boss**\n\nFor the boss, I think I might just need one strong hand, especially since my build can already earn over 6,000 chips. I estimate the ante 3 boss might be around 12k to 14k, but I'm not entirely sure. With my current build and a full house at level 3, I could potentially earn over 10k per hand. I’m considering whether it’s worth spending on a standard pack to improve my odds of getting a full house, since it adds a playing card. However, it’s still random, and I can’t reroll for a planet card. I need to keep that in mind!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m considering that rerolling might reveal a planet card to help grow Constellation or level up my full house. However, if I spend my $5 reroll, I won’t be able to buy anything afterward. Buying a Standard pack for $4 leaves me a bit short for interest, which isn't ideal for the boss fight. \n\nI’m wondering if I should just buy the Lusty Joker instead, but its multiplier might not be as beneficial as the Certificate, which generates sealed random cards each round. I think I’ll stick to the Standard pack, which could provide a helpful playing card and possibly duplicates to improve my deck. Even if there's a risk of getting something useless, it could still aid in achieving my full house! I’ll go ahead and buy the Standard Pack.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
