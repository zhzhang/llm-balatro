{"reasoning":"**Evaluating tarot pack options**\n\nI’m looking at the TAROT_PACK, and the Charm tag is giving me a free Mega Arcana. However, it only lists five tarot cards, and I’m unsure if that implies I must choose two. Normally, with Mega packs, I would select two out of N, but the game state is unclear. I see Justice in my consumables, limited to two. I need to select a tarot that has an immediate effect and is usable later.\n**Understanding tarot selection mechanics**\n\nI'm considering how the select command works in this game. It looks like selecting a tarot from the pack gives it to the consumable slot, and in this interface, I might need to choose targets immediately. From what I remember, selecting tarot in an Arcana pack triggers its effect right away and then disappears, rather than being stored. Since I can also buy tarot, I may need to pick two if it's Mega, applying effects to my current hand cards.\n**Choosing the best tarot options**\n\nI’m deciding on the best choices for my tarot cards. The Chariot (steel) looks strong for mystic summit with its scaling potential. Keeping the steel card in hand provides a 1.5x multiplier, which is significant. Since I need this card but it doesn’t depend on rank, I should attach it to a high-value card that I can leave unplayed. Even though I might have to play all cards for a flush, I can still keep some in hand. So, strategic choices are key!\n**Analyzing hand size and card choices**\n\nI’m figuring out how the hand size works in this game. Normally, I thought there'd be a max of 5 cards, but my hand shows 8, suggesting the hand size is higher than expected—defaulting to 8. This means I can keep 3 cards unplayed, which is great if I want to boost my multiplier with a steel card. I think I'll pick the Chariot and attach it to a less frequently used card, like the 5 of Diamonds, since I'm aiming for a full house instead of a flush.\n**Choosing cards for optimal strategy**\n\nI'm weighing my card options here. The 5 of Diamonds is a candidate for steel. For my second pick, the Hierophant adds +30 chips when scored, and since all played cards score in Splash, this bonus is significant. Playing Ace cards often will benefit from this bonus, so I'll go for the Aces. However, the Hanged Man could help thin my deck by destroying low-value cards. Ultimately, I think I'll pick the Chariot and then the Hierophant for benefits, selecting them one at a time as per the rules.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4,8]"}
