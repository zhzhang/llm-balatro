{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nIn the final round, we need to figure out the boss's conditions. It looks like cards are debuffed until one joker is sold, and we've sold Popcorn, giving us five jokers. This should meet the boss's condition, but I wonder if the selling has to happen during the blind. Since we've already sold, it should be fine. Next, I have to decide whether to play the round or reroll the boss. Rerolling would change things, but the current boss seems manageable. I need to think about reaching 100k chips.\n**Clarifying boss mechanics**\n\nI need to clarify the boss's description, which says, \"All cards debuffed until one joker is sold.\" I'm trying to recall if this is usually associated with \"The Pillar\" or perhaps \"The Needle,\" but I'm not sure. There’s also \"The Fish,\" which seems to fit this mechanic. I think I can sell a joker in blind select, and this should clear the debuff since selling can happen before the round starts. But I want to ensure we rearrange the jokers properly to maximize our advantage before proceeding to play.\n**Considering scoring order**\n\nI realize that the order in scoring really matters here, especially with triggers that occur from left to right. I have a few jokers to consider: Splash, Scary Face, Spare Trousers, Constellation, and Smiley Face. Scary Face and Smiley Face are both tied to on-scored triggers. Spare Trousers gains a multiplier if the played hand contains two pairs, adding an independent bonus. I need to ensure that I position Constellation to the right of the +mult jokers to maximize our score effectively.\n**Analyzing scoring effects**\n\nSo, Splash gives +50 chips and affects scoring by making every played card count, and I think it's independent. The edition foil also provides +50 chips as an independent factor. Even though the addition is commutative, I need to consider the order of on-scored jokers. In step 3, Scary adds chips while Smiley adds multipliers, so their order could matter. The Jack of Clubs might have a glass effect from the Justice pack, but I can't see the current hand in blind select, which is a bit confusing.\n**Finalizing scoring strategy**\n\nIf glass is scored, it multiplies the multiplier by 2 at step 3, which happens before on-scored jokers. The proper order is base chips, then enhancements, and finally the on-scored jokers. Since Smiley adds a multiplier after glass, I can't double Smiley's effect with glass. I may want to rearrange the jokers for optimal scoring. The order should be Splash, Scary Face, Spare Trousers, and Constellation to the right. Since both Smiley and Constellation are independent, their order won't interact negatively. I’m concluding by choosing to play the round.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
