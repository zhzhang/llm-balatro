{"reasoning":"**Assessing poker strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about the impact of selling and whether to disable the boss. Selling results in losing x2.25 multiplier, but if we don’t disable the boss, our hand levels could drop permanently, which is really concerning. The boss effect might just be temporary, but the Arm permanently decreases the poker hand level, which could undermine our scaling strategy. Selling Luchador now seems like a safer bet. I might also consider playing a hand type we don’t mind losing, like high card, to manage levels.\n**Analyzing hand multiplier strategy**\n\nI’m trying to figure out how the increments work. The spare trousers give a +18 multiplier, but it can also become weaker if not careful. The supernova effect depends on the hand type, and switching to another hand type will change how it's counted. For two pair, it’s played seven times, adding a +7 multiplier. The spare trousers seem to gain a +2 multiplier whenever a two pair is played. Overall, it can provide a decent boost, even if I switch hand types.\n**Evaluating card scoring impact**\n\nWith Splash, every played card counts toward scoring, which is significant! It also gives a +50 chip boost. I’m considering the multipliers: Constellation adds a x1.9, while Luchador gives a x1.5, and then there's the polychrome edition, which also provides a x1.5 multiplier. It seems Luchador’s effect and polychrome might not stack. If I sell Luchador, I’ll lose the x2.25 scoring benefit, but disabling the boss could keep the current score. I think I can estimate that scoring without Luchador would drop down to around 10-12k.\n**Considering hand strategy**\n\nI'm not sure how many hands we have per round—maybe default is 4? With the Grabber, we could get 5 hands, which seems sufficient. Alternatively, I could keep Luchador and play a hand type I don't mind losing, like dropping High Card level from 3 to 1. To reach that 40k goal, we’d need some robust hands. If I play two pairs, it might lower the level by 2, but it's manageable. Still, it’s better to disable the boss for scoring, so selling Luchador seems necessary. I can confirm I can sell him during the blind select to achieve this.\n**Deciding on Luchador sale**\n\nI’m considering whether to sell Luchador now to disable the current Boss Blind effect. Selling during the blind select seems essential before I play, but it means losing that big multiplier, which I prefer to avoid. I could hold on to Luchador, hoping to win quickly and accept a level loss later. However, each hand played decreases its type, so I might just play two pairs and accept a significant drop from level 6 to level 4. It seems selling now is the best option, so I'll go ahead with selling Luchador.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [6]"}
