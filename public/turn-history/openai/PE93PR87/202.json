{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI'm in a boss round where all cards are debuffed until one Joker is sold. We sold a Joker in a previous blind select, but it seems the debuff condition continues until we sell during the boss round itself. I must sell one now to remove the debuff, targeting the least valuable card. We need to reach 100k points, but losing one card will reduce our scoring. Debuffed cards score 0 chips, although jokers might still trigger.\n**Evaluating card effects**\n\nI'm noticing that Scary and Smiley depend on face cards for scoring, but I'm unsure if a debuffed card still counts as a face card. It says all abilities are disabled, leading to zero chip scores. However, Jokers might still trigger from played face cards, even when scoring is null. I need to remove the debuff quickly. I'll sell a Joker now, but I have to choose wisely to maintain scoring potential. Splash is critical because it ensures every card counts in scoring, plus it adds 50 chips.\n**Evaluating card values**\n\nI’m assessing the value of different cards. Scary adds +30 chips per face card scored, which is good but not critical. Smiley provides +5 multiplier per face card scored plus an extra 50 chips, making it likely strong. Spare Trousers offers a +32 multiplier, and Constellation gives a solid x2.3 multiplier along with an extra joker slot. Scary Face seems the most expendable since it only adds chips. Splash is crucial for triggering other face cards, but if I play a full hand, its value may diminish. However, it becomes essential for making Two Pair meaningful.\n**Assessing hand value and strategy**\n\nOur best scoring hand is a two pair at level 6, base 120x7, with additional multipliers from Spare Trousers (+32), Smiley, and Constellation (x2.3). I estimate we might reach around 37k points, but we need 100k in about three hands. If I sell Scary, I’ll lose 30 chips per face card, possibly totaling a loss of 3000-8000 chips, which seems manageable. Selling Splash could result in a more significant loss due to the impact on the fifth card. So, I’ll go ahead and sell the Scary face to clear the debuff and keep the others. We’ll ensure this happens during the selecting hand phase.\n**Planning next actions**\n\nI’m considering if I can play a hand right after selling. Since I can only take one action per turn, I need to prioritize. I should sell the Joker first. Once that’s done, the prompt will show the undebuffed cards, allowing me to decide whether to play or discard. So my immediate action is to sell the Joker. I'll prepare to return the JSON with the action to sell the Joker at position [2].\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
