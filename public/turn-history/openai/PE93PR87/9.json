{"reasoning":"**Evaluating next actions**\n\nI need to decide on my next move with three discards remaining and four hands. The boss will discard two random cards per hand due to \"The Hook.\" My goal is to reach a total of 600 chips, and I'm starting at zero. With my current hand, I have the potential for a full house using the three 5s and two 6s, which might already exceed 600 chips. But I might want to discard to get the bonus multiplier from Mystic Summit.\n**Calculating full house score**\n\nTo defeat the boss, I only need 600 chips, so the safest move might be to play an immediate full house to protect my cards from the boss's discards. If I play it now, I could gain a significant amount of chips and possibly beat the blind in just one hand. For the full house, I’ll calculate the score: starting with 40 base chips at level 1 and a multiplier of 4. The cards give me an additional 27 chips total, making it 67 chips with the multiplier in play.\n**Analyzing joker multipliers**\n\nSo, I’m considering how the jokers affect my score. Smiley only kicks in when face cards are scored, and since I have no face cards now, my multiplier stays at 4. That gives a final score of 67 times 4, equaling 268 chips, which isn’t enough to reach 600 in one hand. However, I remember scoring 368 chips earlier, likely due to playing face cards like Kings and possibly using Mystic Summit. If I explore those earlier moves further, I might find a clearer understanding of how the multipliers impact my score.\n**Clarifying joker multipliers**\n\nIt looks like I misunderstood how the multipliers work with face cards. Each face card adds +5 separately to the multiplier rather than multiplying together. So, if I play three face cards, that would give me a total of +15 to my multiplier. Now, regarding my earlier score of 368, it seems that the calculation should be based on chips rather than multiple bonuses. For my full house, if the card chips sum to 52, perhaps I could make that work with a combination of ranks.\n**Finalizing discard strategy**\n\nI'm considering how to use discards to maximize my strategy. Since I need to get to 0 discards for Mystic Summit, I could discard three non-essential cards while preserving my full house. I’m realizing that with my current hand, I can safely discard cards that aren’t part of the three 5s or two 6s. Using all three discards now will activate Mystic Summit, boosting my multiplier significantly. This helps me reach my goal of 600 chips in a hand with a full house and increased multiplier. Keeping the core cards intact while discarding carefully seems to be the best move.\n**Planning discard actions**\n\nI need to focus on my next immediate action, which is to discard cards not part of the full house. The first cards I'll discard are in positions 2 (3S), 3 (AH), and 5 (2H). With two discards remaining, I’ll remove those off cards now. After I draw new cards, I'll continue discarding any that aren't 5s or 6s until I reach 0 discards. This will set me up well to play my full house later! So, I’ll return a JSON output with the discard positions [2, 3, 5].\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,5]"}
