{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game mechanics**\n\nI’m looking at how Square Joker scales chips with exactly 4 cards but also how Splash counts every played card for scoring. This makes using 5 cards attractive, but we need to hit exactly 4 cards for Square. Can I make Two Pair with 4 cards? Yes! With Splash in play, I would want a 5th card for Even Steven, but that could lose Square scaling. Square starts at 0 chips, gaining +4 chips each time I play a hand with 4 cards.\n**Evaluating strategy options**\n\nI’m considering how to manage 3 bosses, along with small and big, and needing strong cards. Square scaling might be limited since we want to focus on playing 4-card Two Pair. However, playing 4 cards reduces total chip contributions with Splash, though it’s still effective. The Ceremonial Dagger could destroy a joker and double its sell value, but we’re already at max jokers. Selling Luchador provides $5, which I need to buy the Dagger, but I’d lose significant multipliers. Instead, I could sell Supernova and Splash, but I still need at least $3 more.\n**Considering selling options**\n\nI’m weighing selling Supernova and Even Steven for $5 to buy Square, but I’d end up with only $1 left and lose my multipliers. It might be more beneficial to keep my current setup. I can’t reroll, so I’ll probably just go to round_select. I could sell Justice for $1 to reach $2, but the shop feels virtually useless. I might want to save Justice for a glass card for the final boss. Since the shop doesn’t have hand cards anyway, that’s not an option. Selling something could boost my money for future shops, but each joker sells for so little—maybe I should consider selling Splash?\n**Evaluating gameplay synergy**\n\nSplash adds +50 chips and enhances scoring in Balatro since every played card counts, which means more chips from non-hand cards. It also triggers Even Steven more frequently. So there's clearly great synergy there—definitely keeping it! Spare Trousers, with its scaling of +18 and an increase of +2 per two pair, is essential. Supernova adds +7, and Constellation at x1.9 gives an extra joker slot, though I’m at max. I realize I shouldn’t sell anything and just proceed to the next round. It seems like we’re in Round 12 after the big blind.\n**Planning next action**\n\nAfter the big blind, I need to head to the shop, followed by the boss blind of ante 6. It looks like I can cancel the current boss by selling Luchador during the boss round, which also gives a x1.5 multiplier. I think I should hold onto Luchador until we face a tough boss. For now, my action will be to go to round_select. I need to respond in the required JSON format with the action specified.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
