{"reasoning":"**Choosing the best planet for build**\n\nI need to decide on the best planet for my build, which focuses on two pairs. I'm considering features like spare trousers and supernova scales depending on playtime, plus an Even Steven multiplier for even ranks. Each planet affects the Constellation scale, currently at x1.6, increasing it by 0.1 per planet used. Jupiter boosts flushes, Black Hole upgrades hands, Mercury focuses on pairs, Pluto offers high cards, and Uranus potentially levels up my hand type. I'm leaning towards Black Hole for its comprehensive upgrades.\n**Selecting strategies for upcoming challenges**\n\nI'm focusing on my strategy since we usually play two pairs and sometimes full houses. The Black Hole would boost my full house, which could really help against a boss that decreases hand levels after each play. The boss's effect means our hands drop in level. Black Hole strengthens all levels. If I can pick a second option, I might choose Uranus for further boosting two pairs. I’ll go with Black Hole first and see how things progress.
