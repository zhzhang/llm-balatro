The boss will discard two random cards per hand due to \\\"The Hook.\\\" My goal is to reach a total of 600 chips, and I'm starting at zero. With my current hand, I have the potential for a full house using the three 5s and two 6s, which might already exceed 600 chips. But I might want to discard to get the bonus multiplier from Mystic Summit.\\n**Calculating full house score**\\n\\nTo defeat the boss, I only need 600 chips, so the safest move might be to play an immediate full house to protect my cards from the boss's discards. If I play it now, I could gain a significant amount of chips and possibly beat the blind in just one hand. For the full house, I\\u2019ll calculate the score: starting with 40 base chips at level 1 and a multiplier of 4. The cards give me an additional 27 chips total, making it 67 chips with the multiplier in play.\\n**Analyzing joker multipliers**\\n\\nSo, I\\u2019m considering how the jokers affect my score. Smiley only kicks in when face cards are scored, and since I have no face cards now, my multiplier stays at 4. That gives a final score of 67 times 4, equaling 268 chips, which isn\\u2019t enough to reach 600 in one hand. However, I remember scoring 368 chips earlier, likely due to playing face cards like Kings and possibly using Mystic Summit. If I explore those earlier moves further, I might find a clearer understanding of how the multipliers impact my score.\\n**Clarifying joker multipliers**\\n\\nIt looks like I misunderstood how the multipliers work with face cards. Each face card adds +5 separately to the multiplier rather than multiplying together. So, if I play three face cards, that would give me a total of +15 to my multiplier. Now, regarding my earlier score of 368, it seems that the calculation should be based on chips rather than multiple bonuses. For my full house, if the card chips sum to 52, perhaps I could make that work with a combination of ranks.\\n**Finalizing discard strategy**\\n\\nI'm considering how to use discards to maximize my strategy. Since I need to get to 0 discards for Mystic Summit, I could discard three non-essential cards while preserving my full house. I\\u2019m realizing that with my current hand, I can safely discard cards that aren\\u2019t part of the three 5s or two 6s. Using all three discards now will activate Mystic Summit, boosting my multiplier significantly. This helps me reach my goal of 600 chips in a hand with a full house and increased multiplier. Keeping the core cards intact while discarding carefully seems to be the best move.\\n**Planning discard actions**\\n\\nI need to focus on my next immediate action, which is to discard cards not part of the full house. The first cards I'll discard are in positions 2 (3S), 3 (AH), and 5 (2H). With two discards remaining, I\\u2019ll remove those off cards now. After I draw new cards, I'll continue discarding any that aren't 5s or 6s until I reach 0 discards. This will set me up well to play my full house later! So, I\\u2019ll return a JSON output with the discard positions [2, 3, 5].\\n\\nCommand: discard 2 3 5\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 11]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Mystic Summit.

I need to hit 0 discards for the mystic bonus. Discarding twice and playing the full house will give me enough chips, but I must keep core cards intact while discarding. I can discard a Jack and a 9 or a 4 and a 9. The risk is that new cards might disrupt the full house, so I need to be careful!\\n**Choosing discard strategy**\\n\\nAfter discarding, my hand refills to 8 cards, but I still want to go for the full house. I need to be cautious because discarding could remove necessary cards. I\\u2019ve decided to discard positions 1 and 7, which are the Jack and the 9, to keep my options safe. I could play the full house now, but the boss discards 2 random cards afterward, which might risk losing key cards. So, discarding now seems best to reach 0 discards!\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 12]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Mystic Summit.

We need 600 chips, and with our current hand, we\\u2019ve got a strong possibility for a full house with the threes fives and two sixes. I\\u2019ll use the last discard to activate Mystic Summit for a big multiplier. I can discard the King of Diamonds without risking our full house potential. After that, I\\u2019ll draw a new card.\\n**Calculating scoring options**\\n\\nSince I have 0 discards left, Mystic Summit is active, and I\\u2019ll play for a full house with my fives and sixes. I could also play a full house without Mystic, but I might not reach 600 chips that way. Let\\u2019s break down the scoring: for a full house, the base chips are 40 with a multiplier of 4. The cards in hand add 27 chips. Mystic Summit boosts my multiplier by 15 when I have no discards, which adds to my total score.\\n**Deciding on discards**\\n\\nI\\u2019ve calculated my multiplier with Mystic Summit, giving me a total of 19, which leads to a score of 1,273 chips! That exceeds 600, which is excellent. Without Mystic, I\\u2019d only score 268, so I definitely want to activate it. Discarding the King of Diamonds won\\u2019t hurt my full house potential. After discarding, I\\u2019ll still have my fives and sixes. I\\u2019ll discard position 7, ensuring I can play the full house next. Keeping it simple seems best here!\\n\\nCommand: discard 7\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Mystic Summit.

You may play up to 5 cards at a time.

  "reasoning": "**Clarifying scoring and boss effects**\n\nI need to double-check some earlier calculations. In the previous full house, I scored 368 without Mystic, likely due to a face card bonus. The formula seems correct: base chips of 40 plus a sum of 52 leads to 368. Here it’s 68 multiplied by 19 for a total of 1292. Now, regarding the boss effect, it activates first and discards two random cards after a hand is played, not affecting the scoring for the hand I just played. I’ll proceed with the full house to maximize chips!\n**Choosing the best hand**\n\nI’m looking at the alternative hand options, where three 5s give a total of 27. So I’ll go with trips of 6s and a pair of 5s. My played cards will be positions 1, 2, and 5 as 6s, while 3 and 6 are the 5s. I can discard one 5 later, which won’t affect my hand. I’ll play cards 1, 2, 5, 3, and 6, aiming for a full house and estimating 1292. I'll format this in a JSON output with the play positions.\n"
