{"reasoning":"**Analyzing deck strategies**\n\nI'm considering the Arcana pack, which is intriguing since it doesn’t require a slot and could strengthen my deck with cards like Death, Hanged Man, and Justice. However, I'm thinking about how Mega Standard adds risk to my deck. I should prioritize buying the Popcorn before the Arcana pack, especially since leaving enough for rerolling the boss is important. If the boss is tough, I'll need that strategy to mitigate risks, especially since we’re approaching ante 7/8.\n**Planning ante strategies**\n\nI'm mapping out tactics for ante 7, covering rounds 13-15. It seems wise to save $10 for a reroll against the boss. I've got $13 now—if I buy Popcorn for $5, I’d only have $8 left and wouldn't be able to reroll. I'm wondering if it's safer to keep that backup unless I'm really confident. Some bosses, like \"The Plant,\" can debuff face cards crucial to my strategy with Scary Face and Pareidolia. This could severely impact my game!\n**Considering boss strategies**\n\nI realize that facing \"The Pillar\" could drastically reduce my chip count since it debuffs after cards are played. It's crucial to keep $10 for a boss reroll, especially since I can only reroll once per ante due to the director's cut. I should hold off on spending until I see the boss. With $13, I can only spend $3 without losing my reroll option, making purchases tricky. Maybe I should skip buying altogether to preserve that safety net, since I can't raise funds after selecting the boss.\n**Deciding on resources**\n\nI'm weighing the options for how to manage my chips. Selling items could help reach $10; for example, I can sell the Moon for $1 or jokers for $2-5. However, I wonder if spending on Popcorn now could be beneficial after selling items like Constellation for $5. Ultimately, I think a boss reroll is more valuable, especially with the threat of \"The Plant.\" Keeping $10 seems wise, even if I can't buy anything now. My best move might be to proceed with blind selection with my current $13.\n**Weighing boss reroll options**\n\nI'm currently in the shop after the big blind at ante 7, knowing there's no shop before the boss. While Popcorn could boost my power, I need to be cautious. The boss threshold might be around 80-100k, and my current best hand is only 36k. That creates a challenge since I might need multiple hands to surpass the threshold. \n\nIf I keep $10 for a reroll, I can't buy anything. Should I invest in Popcorn or preserve the reroll? Given the bosses I might face, including those that debuff face cards, it's crucial to keep that reroll option.\n**Evaluating joker arrangements**\n\nI'm considering the best arrangement for my jokers, especially since I may need to optimize for a boss that might debuff. I think I should keep Pareidolia on the left, as it's passive. As I look at my options, I realize that maintaining $10 for the reroll is essential given the potential threats from the boss. \n\nI’m debating whether to buy Popcorn now or sell one of my jokers. Selling Pareidolia or Scary Face could be a smart move to keep the reroll alive. I need to decide if the mult from Popcorn is worth losing those synergies. It's crucial to balance chip accumulation with the risks of facing the boss.\n**Deciding on joker sales**\n\nI'm thinking about selling Pareidolia to fund purchasing Popcorn while still keeping $10 for a boss reroll. Although losing Pareidolia might slightly reduce my scoring with two pairs, Popcorn's boost is worth it. Rearranging the order to maximize scoring with Popcorn is essential.\n\nSo, I think my next action should be to sell Pareidolia first, allowing room for Popcorn. My idea is that keeping that $10 for a reroll is crucial, and it looks like this plan balances everything well!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
