{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card effects in gameplay**\n\nI noticed that certain cards played in this Ante get debuffed during the boss fight, which could impact our strategy by turning off enhancements and chip values. It raises the question: should we avoid using cards played in previous hands to prevent debuffs? But I realized that if we skip a blind, no cards are played then, so they wouldn’t be debuffed at the boss fight. Still, I wonder if the boss's effect tracks cards played earlier in this Ante.\n**Evaluating boss fight strategy**\n\nDuring the boss fight, I realized that cards used in the first hand haven’t been played previously this Ante, so they won’t be debuffed. However, in the second hand, any card used from the first will be debuffed. I could reduce this risk by using different cards or aiming to win in one hand. If our build is strong enough, we’ll win quickly. But if we skip small and big blinds, we lose the chance to shop between them, which is tricky!\n**Weighing boss strategy and rewards**\n\nIt might be beneficial to beat the boss without visiting the shop while still gaining tags. But if I play the small and big blinds, I earn rewards of $3 and $4, in addition to two shops after winning rounds. That's pretty valuable! However, the boss effect could debuff previously played cards, but I can manage that by using unique cards or potentially defeating the boss in one hand. Since I have limited funds, visiting the shop would help get useful items! So, let's consider playing the small blind rather than skipping.\n**Assessing tag rewards and strategies**\n\nSo, I think the Garbage tag gives $1 per unused discard, which could total $4. I wonder if you gain money at the start when you skip. It seems that the Garbage tag offers immediate cash based on unused discards for the current round. I believe this payout happens after defeating a blind, which could mean that skipping the small blind gives $4, plus the potential for big rewards. However, skipping both blinds means I miss out on earning $3 and the chance for two shops. So, that’s a tricky decision!\n**Strategizing around tags and scoring**\n\nPlaying the small blind gives $3 plus a shop, while skipping gives $4, making skipping a net gain of $1 but without access to a shop, which is crucial. While the big blind offers an Ethereal tag with a free spectral pack, skipping loses both a shop and a $4 reward. I’m leaning towards playing both blinds to maximize my chances for useful items. Additionally, I need to manage discards to trigger Mystic Summit, allowing for better scoring, especially since we want to avoid debuffing cards at the boss fight. Balancing tag effects with the scoring potential is key here!\n**Planning the optimal play order**\n\nI think I’ve got a solid plan for approaching the game for each blind. By playing to beat each blind in one hand, I can minimize debuffed cards for the boss. I should prioritize the order of my jokers, making sure Mystic is played before Luchador and Constellation, as the order of their effects matters. Given their properties, I’ll go with Smiley, Mystic, Constellation, and Luchador. For the action, I’ll set the intended hand type to a full house and play the round, leaving estimated chips null for now.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
