{"reasoning":"**Deciding next actions in the shop**\n\nI need to figure out my next moves in the shop with my $10 and 5 jokers. I can buy Popcorn, Crazy Joker, or maybe go for a reroll. Currently, I'm in Round 15 shopping. The next boss blind is at ante 7. I can reroll the boss for $10, but I’m not sure if I should do it now. I want to maximize my chances against the boss, particularly at ante 7 and 8. My jokers provide strong chips that could help.\n**Analyzing shop options**\n\nIn the shop, I see that Popcorn offers a +20 multiplier initially, but it decays by -4 each round played. This is great for the boss round and the remaining two antes (7 and 8). If I buy it now, it starts at +20, then drops to +16 after facing the boss and decreases further with each round. Crazy Joker seems less reliable since we often play two pair or full house. The Arcana Pack could give me strong tarot cards, which sounds promising. I could also consider the Mega Standard Pack for potential enhancements.\n**Considering pack options**\n\nThe Standard Pack offers random cards, but it might dilute my deck, so it isn't the best choice unless I'm looking for specific cards. I think I'll prioritize buying Popcorn first since it costs $5, leaving me with $5 for other actions. After that, I can use Judgement, which creates a random Joker if I have space. Currently, I have 5 jokers, but what happens if I use Judgement? It consumes a slot but might be worth it; I can sell the Joker later if it's not synergistic.\n**Deciding on the action sequence**\n\nIf I buy Popcorn first, I won't have room for Judgement, so using Judgement first seems like a better plan. This gives me a chance to get a random Joker for free, which I can then decide to keep or sell. I currently have 5 out of 6 slots filled, so if I use Judgement now, it might help with my decision about Popcorn later. If I get a useful Joker, I might even skip Popcorn. The best move is to use Judgement first.\n**Setting up for action in the shop**\n\nSince I have room, it’s time to use Judgement! I also need to think about rearranging my jokers because the order does matter for their triggering effects. I should place additive multipliers, like Splash and Scary Face, before multiplicative ones like Constellation to maximize my benefits. Scary Face triggers on-scored effects and is independent. Pareidolia is also global, so order might not matter for it. For now, my focus will be on using Judgement.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
