{"reasoning":"**Assessing card decisions**\n\nI need to buy Sun, which costs $3, but I currently have $2. I could sell a joker for $2, but that still leaves me short. If I sell Supernova for $2, I’d have $4 and could buy Sun, but I'd be giving up a powerful card. Selling Splash also isn’t an option since it’s vital. I’m considering other cards too, like Pareidolia, which I just bought, or Scary Face, which has synergy. Sun might help with converting cards to hearts, but it could be costly to give up Supernova.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nWith Pareidolia, all cards act as face cards, which influences scoring but not the hand type. Using Splash means all played cards count, so playing five cards would trigger extra chips from Scary Face. Each card contributes chips based on its rank, so I want to ensure I always play five cards. The hand type affects the base multiplier and chips, with a full house providing a better multiplier than a two pair. A full house is preferred, but I’m wondering if using Sun to set hearts would benefit a flush house instead.\n**Thinking about flush house possibilities**\n\nIf I can create a flush house, it could lead to a big score. But I need a full house where all cards are the same suit, which is tricky without suit manipulation. Sun can convert three cards to hearts, so if I have heart pairs or trips, that could help. I'll need two other hearts to complete the five of the same suit. The only challenge is that I can only use one Sun. I’m also trying to remember how the tarot interacts with the cards in my hand versus the deck.\n**Considering tarot strategies**\n\nI can’t use tarot cards like Sun immediately after buying them. If I buy Sun, it becomes consumable, which I can later use during a round to turn cards in my hand into hearts. This could help me create a flush house or full house later. The challenge is that I need to draw the cards I want to convert randomly. I’m debating whether to sacrifice Supernova or sell Pareidolia, but Pareidolia combined with Scary Face is strong, triggering chip gains for all cards. So, I think I should keep it for now.\n**Optimizing card strategy**\n\nI have $2 and can’t make any purchases right now, so I’m thinking about round selecting instead. Selling Supernova could bring in $4 and help with interest, but it might reduce my chances later. I consider the order of jokers to maximize triggers and scores, especially since Scary Face depends on scores. With Spare Trousers, I'm realizing it gains plus multipliers based on Two Pair, so I’ll want to keep that before Constellation for the best effect. Ultimately, I believe I should round select and plan my next moves wisely.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
