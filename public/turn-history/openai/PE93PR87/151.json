{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card purchase**\n\nI’m considering a $3 High Priestess tarot card in the shop. It can create up to 2 random planet cards, but I need to make sure I have space in my consumable slots since I have 2 empty. If I buy and use it immediately, it'll create those planets to occupy the slots right away. This looks like it could increase my hand levels and Constellation scaling, but I should be careful, as using the planets seems to trigger the boss earlier, which might not be the wisest move right now.\n**Deciding consumable strategy**\n\nIn Balatro, I can use consumables in the shop anytime, except during blind select. If I create planets now, I could potentially use them immediately since it only requires one action. After making them, I might be able to use them before leaving the shop. I need to decide next—should I buy and use the High Priestess for $3, or opt for a round_select to preserve interest? Keeping $3 means I earn no interest, but spending it might yield better scoring later. So, I think it's best to go ahead and buy the High Priestess now.\n**Choosing action for High Priestess**\n\nI'm considering the best approach here. Buying is an action, and I could use the High Priestess immediately to create planets. Buying and using right away seems more beneficial since I can then see those planets and maybe take more actions afterwards. I can only issue one action now, but I can act again once the state updates. I confirm that using High Priestess doesn't require a target, so I’ll go ahead with the action: \"buy_and_use_consumable\" for that card. Let's do this!\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
