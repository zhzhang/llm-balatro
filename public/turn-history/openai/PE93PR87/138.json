{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card game strategy**\n\nI’m considering playing 5 cards due to Splash, but I wonder if switching to 4 for two pair might be beneficial. Playing 4 would mean fewer card chip contributions, yet there’s still potential for scoring big with additional cards. Square joker scales chips, but at ante 6-8, the focus might shift from chips to multipliers. I think a second celestial pack for $4 seems like a good buy, especially since each planet increases Constellation. We want to prioritize Uranus for leveling up!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm considering buying the Ceremonial Dagger for $6, but I can't afford it without selling something first. It requires using a joker for each blind selection, which feels risky. Instead, I think it makes more sense to buy the celestial pack, as it’s the only one available. This will help me get another planet and improve Constellation scaling. So, I'm leaning towards doing the buy_booster for one!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
