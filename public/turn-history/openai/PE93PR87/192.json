{"reasoning":"**Considering shop strategy**\n\nI'm currently in a situation where I have $0, so I can't buy anything. I need to decide whether to sell consumables or jokers to get some cash. For the upcoming rounds, I need to beat the big blind and evaluate if I should sell items like the Moon or Hanged Man to buy a Standard pack that costs $4. However, selling items like the Constellation offers better value, but I'd lose some joker slots. Let's check those sell values carefully.\n**Evaluating round strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how each blind counts per round, with a -4 for each played. In round 17, near the end, popcorn seems less useful, but it has a +12 multiplier in my inventory. Wait, I would see a decrease if I'd had it for more than a round, so it's still good. If I sell the Moon and Hanged Man, I’d get $2, but keeping them for future deck modifications might be better. I can’t use them right now since consumables need targets, and there’s no hand in the shop.\n**Clarifying joker slots**\n\nI’m considering that the Standard pack might help me add a good playing card, but it's not crucial since I've already used the Celestial pack. I think it’s best to move on to round selection. I have a maximum of 6 jokers, and the Constellation card gives me an extra slot, which seems like it might let me have 7 jokers. But then again, the negative edition might function differently. It indicates an extra joker slot but still uses one itself. I’ll double-check how it all counts!\n**Evaluating joker mechanics**\n\nI see that the state says the maximum for jokers is 6. But with the negative edition, it seems like it should be 7, although it might just still show 6 as a base capacity. It’s a bit unclear but not super relevant right now. I should rearrange the jokers considering activation order. The Splash card lets every played card count for scoring and gives +50 chips. The order matters—boss effects first, then played cards, which could impact my strategy significantly!\n**Deciding on game strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about how “gains” means permanent increases after each qualifying hand and that it happens after playing, regardless of position. The Popcorn and Constellation cards seem to be independent, as does Splash—though I’m not entirely sure. The Smiley and Scary jokers trigger per face card, affecting scoring order. I want to optimize, placing Smiley after Scary. Given I have $0 right now, I should focus on round selection rather than selling cards, which could hurt my scoring. It’s more about strength at this point!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
