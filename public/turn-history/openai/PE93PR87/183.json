{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card purchase options**\n\nI'm weighing whether to spend $4 on the Arcana pack or the Wily Joker. The Joker slots are full, so I'd need to sell something to buy it. The Arcana pack could provide useful tarot cards like Death or Strength for immediate deck improvement without needing inventory space. With $5, I could get the Arcana pack now and still have $1 left. The risk is that it may offer targeting tarot, but I can select cards for immediate use in the shop. This seems to be the better choice!\n**Analyzing card options for final boss**\n\nI'm considering how the splash ability might increase my chances for a flush or straight flush. Since we're nearing the final ante, I need the strongest scoring. The scoring relies on face card triggers and two pairs scaling. Deck manipulation through tarot could help create more face cards. The Arcana pack might provide helpful cards like The World and The Emperor. I could also buy The Star, but that might dilute my options. Given the costs, I think it's better to keep my budget intact for future needs.\n**Considering interest and money management**\n\nI'm thinking about how interest works at the end of the blind. If I spend down to $1, I won't earn interest, but keeping $5 means I could gain $1 interest. Spending $4 on the Arcana pack might seem worth it, but at ante 8, money feels less critical. However, maintaining that $5 could help for future purchases. Winning blinds could add to my total, possibly allowing accumulated winnings to grow with interest over the next few hands. It's a tricky balance!\n**Deciding on tarot purchases**\n\nI'm weighing whether to get the Arcana pack right now. It might immediately strengthen my deck, but there's a chance it could be wasted. Buying The Star as a consumable could help later for flush possibilities, but it’s not absolutely necessary. The Wily Joker doesn’t seem beneficial, so maybe I should proceed with selecting a round that leaves me with $5 for future shops. The Arcana pack offers three tarot choices right away, and powerful options like The Wheel of Fortune could upgrade my deck significantly. I think I’ll go for the Arcana pack!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
