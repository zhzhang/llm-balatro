{"reasoning":"**Evaluating spectral card options**\n\nI need to choose one of two spectral cards to use: Talisman, which gives a gold seal and earns $3 when played and scores, or Ouija, which randomizes my card ranks but reduces my hand size. \n\nGiven my strong full house build, the Talisman seems wise as it enhances my deck's economy. While Ouija might create powerful combinations, the randomness and hand size reduction feel risky. Talisman seems to align better with my strategy, especially considering how Splash scores played cards.\n**Exploring scoring mechanics**\n\nIt seems that normally only the highest cards contribute, but Splash changes that by allowing all played cards to contribute to scoring and abilities. So a gold-sealed card will always score points if played, even if it doesn't make the final hand. However, including it might disrupt my ability to form a full house, since I need specific ranks and combinations. I think I'll need to be strategic about which rank I place the gold seal on, ideally a rank I frequently use.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI can’t choose the rank for the gold seal; I just need to select an existing card. I could put it on the 2 of diamonds, which means I'd earn $3 whenever that card helps form a scored hand. Given my full house strategy, sealing one of the 2s seems wise since I have duplicates. The Ace of clubs could create a tarot when discarded, but sealing it might not fit my full house needs. So, I think going with the 2 is best for now.\n**Analyzing Ouija's potential**\n\nUsing Ouija changes all cards in hand to a single random rank, which could set me up for an eight-of-a-kind. However, it's important to note that this would only apply to the eight cards in my hand, not the entire deck. While I could quickly push for a five-of-a-kind, it also permanently reduces my hand size by one. This might hinder my full house strategy. It's a trade-off I have to weigh carefully, considering both its benefits and drawbacks.\n**Choosing Talisman strategy**\n\nSince we’re playing at ante 4/8, I need reliable scoring, and full houses already give good payouts. Building a five-of-a-kind could scale better later, but right now that's not a priority. The -1 hand size from using Ouija feels steep. So, I’ll go for Talisman and target either the 2 of clubs or the 2 of diamonds. I’ll choose the 2 of clubs for position 7. This way, when I use it in a full house, I’ll earn $3 each time it scores. It's a solid economic choice!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,7]"}
