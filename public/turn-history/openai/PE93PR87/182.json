{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases in SHOP**\n\nI need to decide how to spend my $10 in SHOP before ante 8. My options include boosters for 6 and 4, a Hone voucher for $10, and a reroll for $5. Since I have full joker slots and some decent items, the boss reroll might be crucial, especially if the next boss is tough. It seems keeping the $10 for a boss reroll is wise, while the Hone voucher might be less valuable now. Buying Hone could help find better jokers or consumables, but I'm unsure.\n**Analyzing choices for max jokers**\n\nI need to weigh my options with max jokers. While I could replace popcorn later, keeping the $10 for a boss reroll seems wise. However, the Hone voucher also costs $10, leaving me with nothing. I'd need to earn money before facing the boss. I can earn $1 from remaining hands and $1 interest per $5 at the end of each blind. If I started with four hands, I should have some money left by the time I reach the boss.\n**Evaluating potential strategies**\n\nIf I play efficiently, I could earn $2-3 plus interest by playing 1-2 hands. After using Hone, I should still accumulate over $10 by the time the boss arrives. With two blinds and two shops before that boss fight, I might have around $4-6 after small blind wins. The Hone could enhance my chances of finding valuable foil or polychrome cards, but it doesn’t guarantee quality. Instead, it seems smarter to buy an Arcana pack for $4 and a Jumbo standard pack for $6, totaling $10.\n**Considering card strategy and options**\n\nI see that purchasing an Arcana pack could give me immediate tarot cards like The Sun or Death, which might enhance scoring with playing cards. Since I have Splash, the playing cards matter, and I'd like more face cards for synergy with Scary and Smiley faces. However, I could also reroll the shop looking for planet cards to increase my Constellation multiplier. Each planet boosts it by a factor of 0.1, and I could reroll twice with my $10 to find good options. But the shop currently has no cards, just boosters and a voucher.\n**Evaluating reroll and shop strategy**\n\nSince the shop currently has no cards, a reroll could generate new ones, potentially including planet, tarot, or joker cards. I think using $5 for the reroll first and then considering a planet card purchase would be my best option. However, I need to maximize my opportunities, and since we can reroll the shop just once with my $10, I might find something valuable. I want to find a planet card to boost my Constellation multiplier. I should reroll the shop to see what I get before making any other purchases.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
