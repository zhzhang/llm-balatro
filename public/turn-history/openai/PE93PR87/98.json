{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card play strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about how we can play 5 cards, and with Splash, all 5 contribute to chips and effects, while a joker could trigger something. It’s interesting that every played card factors into scoring, even if it’s not in the best hand. For a full house, I’ll need exactly 5 cards, which means strategizing my choices. If I can't draw a third K or Q, I'll have to consider playing two pair. That could be tough, but maybe jokers can help?\n**Calculating Full House potential**\n\nPreviously, I scored a Full House at 10,358.4 with ante 4 big blinds, using Luchador x1.5 and Constellation x1.4. I wonder if Mystic Summit contributed as well. Right now, I need 10k in chips. If I can activate Mystic Summit and maybe Justice Glass while playing a Full House, I should easily exceed the goal. It makes sense to keep drawing for that third K or Q and hold off on playing, while discarding J♠, 5♠, 3♠, and 4♥.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,5]"}
