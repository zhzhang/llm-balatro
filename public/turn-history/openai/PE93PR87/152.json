{"reasoning":"**Deciding on planet usage**\n\nI'm in a shop with no funds or cards to buy anything. I have two planet consumables: Pluto and Venus. I'm weighing whether to use them now or save for later or sell. Using both will give a decent constellation boost, increasing my multiplier. But I wonder if I should save them for future observatories, especially since I don’t have a voucher. However, the need for power right now is pressing!\n**Using consumables wisely**\n\nSupernova counts the hands we've played: two pairs 9 times and full houses 7 times, suggesting we might lean on those. Using Pluto and Venus could help us pivot towards a high card or three of a kind if necessary, which seems beneficial. The constellation scaling is appealing and essentially free, but I need the space since I can't buy more consumables right now. It feels like a good strategy to use at least one planet now to clear space and boost constellation. I'll consider using Venus first!\n**Considering joker order and triggers**\n\nI need to consider the order of jokers and how they trigger effects. The constellation acts as an independent joker, with its multiplier applied at a separate stage. Rearranging the jokers could be key since activation order impacts independent multipliers. I think additive jokers like Spare Trousers, Supernova, and Even Steven should apply after direct multipliers. Splash is crucial too, as it means all played cards count towards scoring, triggering chips even from non-hand cards. It feels like there's a lot to manage here!\n**Optimizing joker triggers**\n\nSplash is exciting because it says every played card counts in scoring, meaning all cards contribute chips and trigger on-scored. This works really well with Scary Face! I think we should rearrange jokers to optimize these triggers since on-scored jokers activate left-to-right for each card played. Even Steven impacts even ranks, while Scary Face focuses on face cards. Plus, Spare Trousers provides a multiplier if the hand contains two pair. It's all about figuring out the best order for maximizing chips and multipliers!\n**Finalizing chip and multiplier order**\n\nIt's interesting that the order of chip modifiers doesn't affect the final multiplier, but I think the order of independent multipliers matters. I want to apply additive multipliers before the x multiplier to maximize effects. Currently, I have Splash, Even Steven, Spare Trousers, Supernova, Constellation, and Scary Face in that order. I feel like it’s best to use Venus first since the three-of-a-kind level might help, but I should consider saving Pluto just in case a future boss debuffs something. However, using both now seems wise!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
