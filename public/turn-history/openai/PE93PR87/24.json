{"reasoning":"**Analyzing boss effects**\n\nI’m thinking about the boss effect, which seems to take specific cards played earlier in the ante and debuff them. This means only those same cards get affected, not the rank itself. It looks like we should keep track of which cards we've already played to strategize for the boss fight. I noticed I have duplicates of the Ace of Clubs, and I might need to avoid playing those in the boss match. It seems manageable!\n**Evaluating hand options**\n\nI'm considering that we might actually need high cards, especially since the certificate gives us extra each round. To reach 1200 points, we could aim for a full house or maybe two pairs with jokers. My current hand includes Aces and Kings, which means I can make two pairs with those. If I play five cards, I risk wasting one because non-participating cards don't score. So, I should probably keep it to exactly four cards for the best scoring strategy with what I have.\n**Strategizing discard usage**\n\nI’m realizing that we made 1,116 chips from a two pair while in the small blind, but we need 1,200 chips to reach our goal. The two pair might fall short unless we use face cards, and the Mystic Summit bonus won't trigger if we have any discards. Since we have four discards right now, I think the best plan is to use them for sculpting our hand and then aim for that big scoring hand at the end when we have zero discards. Plus, since it'll reset in the next round, using them now should work fine!\n**Planning optimal hand use**\n\nTo minimize the number of cards played, I’m considering winning in one hand by using all four discards to get down to zero. If I play a two pair with both Kings and Aces, that would activate Mystic for a +15 multiplier and score high with the Kings adding +10. The total multiplier could come to 40.5! With the chips from the cards, it looks like we’d score enough. I just need to ensure I keep those two Aces and two Kings in hand after discarding!\n**Optimizing the discard strategy**\n\nI'm contemplating how to use my discards effectively. I can discard up to five cards to sculpt my hand, but I’ll need to keep my Aces and Kings to maximize my chances later. The goal is to reach zero discards before playing my big hand, ideally a two pair with lower-ranked cards, maximizing Mystic’s multiplier. I’m also considering discarding my special Ace to generate a tarot card since I have no consumable slots right now. This way, I can enhance my utility while preserving my stronger cards for the boss battle!\n**Deciding on discards strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how to manage my discards effectively. I want to keep my Aces and Kings while searching for pairs among lower ranks, but I need to avoid accidentally discarding them during the process. Since I'll use all four discards to activate Mystic, I plan to discard weaker cards, including my special Ace for a tarot card. By doing so, I will maintain a solid hand and ensure I'm ready for the boss round while still having strong options available if needed!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,8,9]"}
