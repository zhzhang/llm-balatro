{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker strategy**\n\nI'm in the shop after beating the big blind at Ante4, preparing for the upcoming boss blind. Currently, I'm at Ante4 Round 8, and I have $16. I have a setup with a maximum of 6 jokers, but there's a twist: a negative Constellation that might let me have 7. However, since state restrictions say I can’t exceed 6, I might need to sell a joker if I want to buy a new one. The Gluttonous Joker seems like a good candidate because it boosts scoring.\n**Considering hand strategies**\n\nSupernova adds the number of times a hand is played to the multiplier. Since we mostly play full houses (7 times), that gives a +7 multiplier, which is strong—definitely better than Gluttonous. However, Supernova counts the type of hand played, so if I switch to, say, four of a kind, the bonus would be zero. Mystic Summit is useful early in each round since it requires zero discards. I’m thinking about full houses and pairs; technically, a full house consists of a pair and three of a kind, not two pairs.\n**Planning consumable strategies**\n\nI realize that Spare Trousers triggers on a full house, making it seem like it contains two pairs, which creates some synergy. We also have a Justice consumable but no others for now. Since I've got a free consumable slot, I could buy The Chariot tarot card for $2, and it would be useful later in the round. Alternatively, there's the Celestial pack to get a planet for immediate use, which would raise our Constellation multiplier from x1.3 to x1.4. Buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6 seems like a solid choice; I might go for \"Earth\" if available!\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI’m planning to buy and open the pack, and I need to keep in mind that actions like buy_booster might lead to a new state requiring further choices. It’s important to take one action at a time. The Spectral pack for $4 could also provide powerful effects, but I’m uncertain about it. With $16, I could potentially buy both the Supernova and The Chariot, but I need to manage my joker slots wisely. Selling the Gluttonous Joker seems like a smart move for $2, so I might go ahead with that and then focus on buying.\n**Analyzing strategy for upgrades**\n\nI’m considering my options, particularly the Luchador for a multiplier and Gluttonous for scoring. Supernova seems like a stronger choice since it provides a consistent multiplier based on how often I’ve played a hand. The Chariot could enhance a selected card but might require careful timing in order to use it effectively. Buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack first feels like a wise move because it immediately boosts my Constellation multiplier. However, I should consider selling Gluttonous to make space for Supernova. Overall, I need to focus on maximizing my effects for the upcoming boss!\n**Deciding on the next actions**\n\nI note that steel enhancement has a multiplier of x1.5 while the card is held in hand, and that bonus triggers after scoring. Stacking multiple steel cards could be very powerful, so I want to acquire more. For my next move, I’m planning to sell the Gluttonous Joker to free up a slot and gain some funds. Afterward, I’ll buy Supernova. Gluttonous adds multipliers based on club cards scored, but since I tend to play full houses, Supernova feels like the better choice overall. So, my action will be to sell Joker 6!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [6]"}
