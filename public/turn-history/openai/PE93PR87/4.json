{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card choices**\n\nI need to decide between two jokers: Smiley Face or Shoot the Moon. With Mystic Summit allowing zero discards and granting a +15 multiplier, I think scoring consistently early is key. Smiley Face gives +5 for each face card played, which is great for hands like JQK. On the other hand, Shoot the Moon relies on holding onto queens, making it tricky early on. Since Smiley Face has immediate benefits, I'll go with that.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
