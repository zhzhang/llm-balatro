{"reasoning":"**Calculating poker strategy**\n\nI’m calculating how to score in this poker game. With two pairs, it seems I can reach around 23k at ante 6 bigs, but I need at least 7k. Aiming for another two pair seems safe. Right now, I have A♠, A♦ (pair of aces) and 9♠, 9♦ (pair of nines), so that’s already two pair. I think I can trigger Spare Trousers and Supernova to boost my score. Playing these cards could easily exceed 6999 points!\n**Understanding card scoring in Splash**\n\nWith Splash, I see that every played card counts for scoring, which means even those not part of the best hand contribute. So, all five played cards score, which can activate various effects. This is great since I can include bonus cards like an Ace for more chips. I plan to stick with two pair to maintain my base hand, but I could add cards like Q or K, which score better. Including a 2 gives a nice multiplier, but the K has higher chip value. Balancing those factors seems essential!\n**Estimating chip values**\n\nI’m figuring out how each card adds chips based on its value and enhancements while triggering Even Steven for even cards. The King is worth 10 chips, while a 2 is 2 chips but gives a +4 multiplier, which could really ramp up my score! This adds to the total multiplier, potentially increasing it by about 10%. I’m leaning towards playing 2♥. Playing A♠ as my bonus gives an additional 11 chips too. I’ll arrange my cards for a two pair and aim to exceed 7k, estimating around 25k!\n**Planning my play**\n\nI'm deciding to play the cards in positions 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8 for my two pair strategy. My target score is around 24,000 chips with this play. I need to stay focused on hitting that goal, and I think sticking to this arrangement will give me a solid chance to get there. Keeping track of my positions and aiming for that chip count seems crucial. Let’s see how this goes!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,6,7,8]"}
