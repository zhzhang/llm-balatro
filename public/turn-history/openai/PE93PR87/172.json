{"reasoning":"**Calculating game mechanics**\n\nI have The Moon consumable to transform up to 3 selected cards into Clubs, which might help with flushes, though our focus is mainly on Two Pair and Full House. The Constellation x2.1 indicates that using planet cards would be beneficial, but there aren’t any available in the shop. Regarding Popcorn, it starts at +20 but decays by 4 for each round played. Since we have about 4 rounds left, the bonus would decrease significantly. The Crazy Joker provides a +12 multiplier for straights, but we rarely go for those.\n**Assessing strategic purchases**\n\nThe Arcana pack can provide tarot cards, which might help, but I need immediate support for the boss. Additionally, the Tarot Merchant can double tarot frequency in the shop, but there’s no shop before the boss fight. With $15, I can buy Popcorn for $5, leaving $10 for a boss reroll, which seems ideal. \n\nI could consider buying both Popcorn and the Arcana pack, but then I wouldn’t have enough left for the reroll. To keep my options open, it’s best to just buy Popcorn and maintain the $10 for later.\n**Evaluating shop rerolls and triggers**\n\nI’m considering whether to reroll the shop for planets, which would cost $5, leaving me with $10, but I’d miss the chance to get Popcorn. Popcorn feels more reliable for scaling, so I’d prioritize that purchase. \n\nI’m also thinking about the order of my jokers for scoring. For example, Scary Face gives +30 chips for played face cards, and its effect triggers when each card scores. I need to plan for how joker effects interact while keeping in mind that Popcorn and Constellation are independent multipliers in play.\n**Optimizing multiplication order**\n\nFor maximizing my score, I want to make sure that the additive multipliers are applied before the multiplicative ones, like the Constellation, which is a multiplier effect. I realize that independent jokers activate from left to right, so I need to arrange my order strategically.\n\nTo get the best results, I should sequence them as follows: first Splash (chips), then Scary Face (per-card chips), followed by Spare Trousers and Popcorn (both additive multipliers), and finally Constellation (the multiplicative effect). After buying Popcorn, I can rearrange them, which is important for the overall strategy!\n**Planning purchases and rearrangements**\n\nThe plan is to buy Popcorn first, then rearrange my cards to put Constellation in the last slot. Right now, Constellation is in slot 3, so I’ll need to rearrange after the purchase. \n\nSince my actions are limited, it makes sense to get Popcorn now. I’ll proceed with the action to buy card 1, which is Popcorn for $5. The shop also has Crazy Jokers for $4, but I’m committing to Popcorn.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
