{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card strategy**\n\nI need to survive against the boss, which means I must focus on scoring consistency. Mystic Summit can help if I use all discards. The boss discards two random cards per hand, which complicates planning. However, I can still win with a basic full house. Given a $5 budget, buying the Buffoon pack seems best to get another joker for future challenges. While skipping big buys may seem risky, buying Buffoon now feels like a solid decision. Levels from early runs could help too.\n**Deciding on card packs**\n\nThe Celestial pack offers immediate planet options, like a full house, but the Buffoon pack might provide better scaling. With $5, I can either buy one $4 booster or go for Uranus at $3, leaving $2. Buying Buffoon for $4 leaves me with $1, which means low interest at the end of the next round. Survival is the priority here, so I’ll buy the Buffoon pack. After that, I can choose from up to two jokers. Let's go for it!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
