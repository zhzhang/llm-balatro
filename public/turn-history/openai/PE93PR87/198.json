{"reasoning":"**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nEvery played card counts in scoring, meaning all played cards contribute their chips and enhancement effects, triggering on-scored mechanics. Creating a glass card on a face card could double the multiplication factor. Each glass card, when scored, multiplies the multiplier by 2, which is significant! However, there's a 1 in 4 chance of destroying it upon scoring. Hierophant adds +30 extra chips to two cards, and with our current multipliers from various enhancements, our total can be extremely high.\n**Exploring card combinations**\n\nI see that the Sun can convert cards to hearts, which might help create a flush, but our deck is pretty inconsistent. In the shop, we have a current hand of 8 cards, including some notable ones like A♠ and Q♥. I could use the Sun to convert up to 3 cards to hearts for more flush potential, but our flush level is low. With two pairs already in hand, I'll need 4 cards for pairs plus one extra for scoring with Splash counting as the fifth card.\n**Planning for face card strategy**\n\nI think it's better to include face cards in my hand, so I'm aiming to play 7♣, 7♦, 4♥, 4♦, plus either Q♥ or J♣ for the face triggers. For the boss, I’m not sure about the threshold, maybe around 100k or 150k? We can manage a hand scoring around 37k for two pairs and 42k for high cards, which could help us beat the boss. Keeping $10 is useful for a reroll if it gets dangerous. Now, choosing tarot, Justice can enhance a selected card into a Glass Card, which we should apply to a frequently played face card.\n**Choosing the right card for enhancement**\n\nI'm leaning towards selecting a card that's frequently played and has a high chip value, like Ace or face cards (10 or Jack). Although glass doubling the multiplier is independent of rank, I’m considering the Ace of Spades bonus for its high chip value. However, there's a 25% chance of it getting destroyed, which could mean losing that bonus. Ideally, I want maximum immediate power to beat the boss, yet I also need to think about long-term utility. Face cards provide additional benefits like triggering Scary and Smiley Face effects, so that’s definitely a consideration too!\n**Deciding on card enhancements**\n\nI think I’ll put glass on a face card, probably the Jack of Clubs, since it has nice bonuses. It gives base chips of +10, a bonus of +30, plus additional effects like Scary Face for +30 chips and Smiley for +5 multiplier, which together could be quite powerful. There’s a chance I'll lose it if destroyed, but I can likely replace it. Alternatively, I could use Hierophant to create two more bonus cards, but the glass doubling could provide even more immediate power. I’ll go with glass on the Jack of Clubs, targeting its position for enhancement.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,5]"}
