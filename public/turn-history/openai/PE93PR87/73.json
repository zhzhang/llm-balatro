{"reasoning":"**Clarifying slot usage**\n\nIn the UI, it looks like there are 6 slots available, even with jokers involved. If one joker, Constellation, is negative, it shouldn't count toward the filled slots. So, we have 5 filled slots plus 1 for Constellation, which makes it 6 total. But, I realize that to buy a new non-negative joker, we need an empty slot. With the current setup, it seems there’s actually 1 free slot left because the negative joker doesn’t occupy a slot.\n**Examining game show mechanics**\n\nIn the game show, it seems we have maxed out our jokers at 6/6, which could mean that negative jokers still count toward that limit. Since negative gives an extra slot, it appears we’re full and need to sell one to buy another. When considering the Runner with scaling chips for straights, I'm noticing we're not using straights. \n\nThe Gluttonous Joker is interesting because clubs in our deck can add a +3 multiplier when scored. The Splash ability means every played card counts, including kickers, which is fantastic! With Gluttonous, even non-hand clubs will score, amplifying those multipliers when we play multiple clubs per hand.\n**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nWe typically play with 5 cards, and with Splash, every card contributes—particularly clubs, which could add a +3 multiplier each. While my strategy around a full house might not directly match up with suits, it could still be beneficial since we often include 2-3 clubs. The potential to gain a multiplier of +6 to +9 isn't massive, but it’s still significant.\n\nComparing existing jokers, Spare Trousers gives a +4 multiplier and grows, while Mystic Summit is strong at +15. Splash has a huge impact with +50 chips, and Certificate is moderate. Luchador offers a x1.5 multiplier, plus a disabling ability, and Constellation gives x1.3. I’m thinking Certificate might be the least valuable for immediate scoring, although it helps with seals and deck growth. \n\nHowever, at an ante of 4, I might need more scoring power. The Gluttonous Joker, with its additive multiplier during scoring, could work well with Splash. It might outperform Certificate, but selling Certificate could affect long-term strategies.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m considering which cards to keep. I think I'll hold onto Spare Trousers, Mystic Summit, Splash, Luchador for its multiplier and the ability to skip a boss, and Constellation. So, if I buy Gluttonous, I might need to sell Certificate. \n\nRight now, I have $8. Buying Gluttonous costs $5, and selling Certificate would give me $3, leaving me with a net cost of $2. It’s important to remember that I need to sell before buying. If I sell Certificate, that gets me up to $11, then after the purchase, I’d have $6 left. \n\nKeeping money above $5 earns interest, so having $6 is good. I’m just weighing if Gluttonous is worth it, considering our current scoring is around 10k chips with the full house, and a little multiplier boost could help.\n**Deciding on card strategies**\n\nI see that Mystic Summit gives a +15 multiplier when no cards are discarded, combined with Spare Trousers and Luchador, which results in a potentially high multiplier already. Adding Gluttonous could further enhance the final score. For example, starting with a base multiplier of 8 for a full house, it could rise to around 105.3 with the right multipliers, which is a significant boost.\n\nHowever, I'm uncertain about consistently having three clubs. Should I consider using The Sun or The World? I remember using the Devil to convert a 2 of Spades into gold, which complicates things because it’s not visible in the current deck state.\n\nRerolling costs $6, which might leave us too low on funds. Since we also have the option to sell Certificate, it seems valuable as it adds a random sealed card each round. But this could dilute ranks in our full house strategy.\n\nI'm leaning toward selling Certificate to acquire Gluttonous while keeping our full house more consistent. I need to be cautious with actions though and ensure to proceed with selling Certificate first before buying. Let's do that!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
