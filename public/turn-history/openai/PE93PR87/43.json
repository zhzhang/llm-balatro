{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop choices**\n\nI'm in a shop with $2, but unfortunately, I can't afford anything because all the boosters cost more than that. The only option is to go to round_select. However, I’m considering rearranging the jokers since the order might matter. There are various jokers I have, each with different effects. It's important to note that while a full house in poker contains a pair, it doesn't count as two pairs. I need to think through how to proceed!\n**Clarifying poker hands**\n\nIn a full house like AAAKK, it can form a pair (KK), but it doesn't create two pairs because I need distinct pairs, and there's no way to do that with five cards. However, if I choose four cards like AAKK, that does give me two pairs. So in a sense, AAAKK can \"contain\" two pairs since subsets exist. In Balatro, a full house indeed contains two pairs. Regarding jokers, it seems like some are independent; for instance, Mystic Summit gives a +15 multiplier when there are no discards.\n**Discussing joker effects**\n\nI'm pondering the trigger conditions for Spare Trousers, which likely activate when the hand contains two pairs, possibly \"on played\" like the Green Joker. The order between Spare Trousers and Mystic Summit seems to be less crucial since they both add multipliers additively. However, I know that with multiplicative effects, the order does matter. I need to apply additive multipliers first, followed by multiplicative ones to maximize the overall effect. So, the best order should be: Spare Trousers, Mystic Summit, Constellation, and finally, Luchador.\n**Analyzing joker multipliers**\n\nIn Balatro, the Polychrome Joker gives a x1.5 multiplier and operates independently, likely stacking with Luchador's x1.5 effect. I'm unsure about the order, but to maximize benefits, I think I should apply additive multipliers before the multiplicatives. It seems like I should also keep the Certificate for last since it just adds a card without affecting scoring directly. So, my order should be: Spare Trousers, Mystic Summit, Sly Joker, Constellation, Luchador, and finally the Certificate. I’m questioning if the \"+chips\" modifier might interact differently, but it likely doesn't affect the final multiplication. I’m still considering whether Spare Trousers falls into the \"On played\" category.\n**Deciding on joker arrangement**\n\nIt seems like I can rearrange the jokers now, which is a free action before leaving the shop. Since optimizing for scoring is important, I'm thinking of placing the +mult jokers before the xmult ones. The +mult jokers I have are Mystic Summit and Spare Trousers, while Constellation and Luchador provide xmult. The final order should be: Spare Trousers, Mystic Summit, Sly Joker, Constellation, Luchador, and Certificate. After the rearrangement, I’ll probably go to round_select. I need to double-check that I'm using the correct indices for the rearrange command. I’ll use [6, 1, 5, 3, 2, 4] for that.\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [6,1,5,3,2,4]"}
