{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about the Glass mechanic, which can double multipliers when played, but it also has a risk of destroying cards. I wonder if using it on an Ace could be valuable, especially with the scoring multiplier. For now, I think it's better to win without taking risks, especially since we're saving for a big boss encounter later. I should keep the Ace for card combinations; maybe holding off on playing it could be beneficial. So I'll go ahead and play the necessary cards.\n**Planning final hand strategy**\n\nI'm considering holding the Steel Jack (2) for our last hand of the round to generate a planet card if we win. If we do win in one hand, it’ll create a three-of-a-kind planet, which is a great outcome! We currently have one consumable slot used, so it’s good that we have room for another. Also, I can keep a gold card, which gives $3 if I have it at the end. So, I'll play cards 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7, keeping 2, 4, and 8 in hand. Let's estimate around 18k chips!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6,7]"}
