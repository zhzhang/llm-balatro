{"reasoning":"**Planning the next move**\n\nI need to figure out my next action with my current chips at 29,223 in a small blind situation, aiming for 35,000. There are 3 hands left and I need 5,777 more chips. The safest bet seems to be playing any decent hand. I could even try to minimize selection by playing one card, but the specs allow for up to 5 cards. So, to maximize my score, I'll go for 5 and include face cards for synergy.\n**Deciding on hand strategy**\n\nI’m evaluating whether to play a pair or keep my high card for maximum chips. A pair has the same base of 25 chips but activates Supernova, which depends on how many pairs I've played. Since I've played none, it would add 0 to my score. In contrast, my high card has been played 3 times, adding +3 to Supernova, which is really significant. So, to maximize my scaling and build, it seems more advantageous to stick with the high card.\n**Evaluating hand options**\n\nI’m considering my long-term strategy of aiming for two pair to boost my spare trousers. Right now, I have a pair of 9s and a pair of jacks, so I can definitely play two pair! I have 9 of clubs, 9 of diamonds, and jacks of hearts and diamonds, plus a king of hearts as my fifth card. This gives me a level 4 two pair worth 80, with a multiplier of 5. Plus, it triggers Supernova, which will add +9 to my multiplier, enhancing my spare trousers. Playing two pair is definitely the best choice!\n**Calculating chip estimates**\n\nI’m working with my selection indices: two kings, three jacks, and two nines, which gives me two pair (jacks and nines) plus a king kicker. That's promising! Each face card scores +30 chips, so that’s 90 from my king and jacks. The base chips add up too, but the multiplier for the king enhances my score. However, activating even Steven won’t apply here. I think my previous high cards were around 14-15k. Given my last ante was 22k, I’ll estimate around 22,000 chips now. I’ll proceed with the play, keeping in mind the potential boss impact.\n**Finalizing the play action**\n\nI realized that Scary Face triggers with played face cards. If they’re face down, they might still count as faces, but I can't see them. So, it's uncertain. Regardless, I can still consider playing them. For my action, I'll use the indices [2, 3, 5, 6, 7] for two pair and estimate my chips at over 20,000. This seems like a solid step forward! Time to proceed with the action!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,5,6,7]"}
