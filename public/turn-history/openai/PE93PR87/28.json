{"reasoning":"**Planning a full house play**\n\nI'm going to specify that I need to play a full house and I've got an estimated 5940 chips. It's essential to ensure there are no other effects at play. The order of cards for scoring seems to matter when I trigger a smiley with a face card, but there's no need to retrigger it. I wonder if I should enhance a King card with a Justice consumable for a double multiplier, but that might risk destroying the card, so I'll save it for the boss. Instead, I'll go ahead and play my cards in the positions 1, 4, 5, 2, and 7.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,2,7]"}
