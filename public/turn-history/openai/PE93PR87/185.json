{"reasoning":"**Deciding on next steps**\n\nI need to choose my next action. I'm in a shop with just $1, which means I can't buy anything right now. I thought about using a consumable called The Moon, but I can't since I have no target cards in hand. Selling a joker to buy The Star isn't possible either, because I only have $1. So, my best option is to proceed to the round select and return the action in JSON format.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
