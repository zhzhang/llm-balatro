{"reasoning":"**Considering poker strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about my current poker situation with a hand of K♥(mult), K♣(mult), Q♣, 5♣, 4♣, Q♦, 6♦, 2♦. I have two pairs and the chance to make a full house with remaining discards. Since the boss prohibits repeating hand types, I want to strategize wisely. Ideally, I should use my discards to aim for a full house to hit the 10k mark. Additionally, I could leverage Mystic Summit, which might help increase my score significantly.\n**Analyzing card strategies**\n\nI need to use all three of my remaining discards before playing since I require zero discards at play time. With my cards, I have Justice and Chariot; Justice can double a card's multiplier but comes with some risk. Chariot offers a 1.5x multiplier while held in hand. I’m realizing that with Splash, every played card counts in scoring, even cards not in my poker hand. This means I can enhance my score by playing more cards, which opens up additional strategies.\n**Planning for full house**\n\nThe boss prohibits repeating hand types, so if I can make a full house once and exceed 10k, it means I win. I don’t think I need to disable the boss with Luchador since I can keep it for the 1.5x multiplier. I already have a strong hand with two pairs. To aim for that full house, I should draw another King or Queen. There are two Kings left in the deck and two Queens, giving me a decent chance among the 45 remaining cards. Plus, I have three discards available to improve my chances!\n**Formulating full house strategy**\n\nTo form a full house, I need three of a kind and a pair. I currently have KK QQ, so if I draw another King, that gives me KKK QQ, and another Queen would be QQQ KK. To maximize my draws, I should discard the lower cards that aren’t K or Q: 5♣, 4♣, 6♦, and 2♦. If I discard those four cards, I can draw four new ones. With three discards available, I could make up to 12 draws total. The probability of not drawing any K/Q seems moderate, but I should probably stick with my pairs since the boss prohibits repeats. Even so, I could still play two pairs if necessary, scoring 40 chips multiplied by 3 at level 2.\n**Strategizing for full house and multipliers**\n\nSpare Trousers boost my score by adding a +2 multiplier to two pair hands, but even then, I'm still below 10k points. However, with my joker set, a full house multiplies significantly due to Supernova counts. \n\nCurrently, I can expect a multiplier due to the two pair count and how many times I've played my hands. Mystic Summit also adds a +15 multiplier when I have no discards left. My plan is to use all three discards, aiming for strong hands and multipliers like Chariot for extra benefits while keeping my two pair. I’ll discard the weaker cards positioned as 4, 5, 7, and 8 to maximize my chances.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,5,7,8]"}
