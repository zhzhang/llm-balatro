{"reasoning":"**Analyzing celestial pack options**\n\nI'm thinking about planet mapping with various rankings: Pluto high card, Mercury pair, Uranus two pair, etc. Earth has a full house, which can be powerful, so I want to leverage that with a celestial pack. It's interesting how the constellations scale with the planets used. Plus, the voucher Grabber seems useful for increasing flexibility in money. I also wonder about the Wheel of Fortune and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. Balancing discard strategies could be key here.\n**Evaluating discard and pack strategies**\n\nI realized the Mystic works when there are zero discards remaining, so I can discard early and still score. The Mail-in rebate incentivizes specific discards, which might complicate things since we'll be focused on playing full houses. But discarding can help in finding those. The Arcana pack could provide valuable tarots, yet the celestial pack seems more important for planets and constellations. I'm considering the costs, and it sounds like buying the Grabber voucher could fit into my budget well.\n**Thinking through purchases and Joker slots**\n\nI realized we’re already at the maximum of six Joker slots, meaning we have a base of five plus one additional. However, both the negative edition and the Constellation offer +1 Joker slots. It’s interesting to see that these extras might be accounted for already. Now, I need to figure out which purchases to prioritize: Grabber voucher, Celestial Pack, or the Wheel of Fortune. The Wheel is a tarot consumable, so I can buy it as a card, but I need to consider how I'll use it right away.\n**Weighing Wheel of Fortune's value**\n\nI'm thinking about how using the Wheel of Fortune gives a 1 in 4 chance to add an edition to a random Joker. If it fails, nothing happens, but the attempt will still be counted. Since I have the money, it might be worth it, even though I already have good editions. I could hold onto the Justice for now. The potential bonuses from the Wheel are appealing, like a Foil or Polychrome, but there’s a risk involved. Still, the cost seems low enough to consider it!\n**Deciding on purchases for gameplay**\n\nI realized I can use the Wheel of Fortune immediately without it taking up a slot. By buying the Celestial Pack, I’d get to choose three planet cards that will trigger Constellation scaling. Earth is a priority for a full house, but I might also look at Uranus or Jupiter. However, since I can only take one action right now, I’m leaning toward buying the Grabber voucher first. It's guaranteed to improve my game without relying on the pack's content, so I'll go ahead and make that purchase!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
