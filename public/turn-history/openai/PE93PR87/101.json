{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI’m considering whether to use Justice on a played card, probably an Ace or a King. There’s a risk of destruction, which could cost me key ranks, though winning the round is the priority. Since we need to defeat the boss, sacrificing a card may be acceptable, but it could hurt future bets. I'm thinking it might be better to win with minimal risk and save Justice for later. I need to compute the expected score for Two Pair or a Straight!\n**Analyzing poker mechanics**\n\nI’m looking at the implications of playing Two Pair, which upgrades my Spare Trousers and gives me a base of 40 chips and a three-fold multiplier. This is better than the Straight, which offers 30 chips with a four-fold multiplier. However, with the Splash effect, all played cards contribute to my chips, allowing me to play both Kings and Queens, plus an Ace for a total of 51 chips. This could boost my total to 141 chips! Now, I need to calculate the multipliers based on my card placement.\n**Exploring card multipliers**\n\nI’m analyzing the multipliers involving Kings, which add +4 each when scored, while Queens and Aces don't have multipliers. Ordering the Kings strategically matters because later scoring can trigger multiplicative effects, like from glass. I also see that I have jokers with independent multipliers: Constellation at x1.4 and Luchador at x1.5. The J♠ in hand can add an x1.5 boost as well. If Justice is scored with glass, it might double the total multiplier. To maximize gains, scoring glass after all other multipliers is crucial!\n**Clarifying scoring order**\n\nI’m sorting through the card scoring process and how multipliers work. The independent x multiplier jokers get applied after scoring, meaning glass doesn’t multiply them. First, I score the cards, then consider held effects, followed by the independent jokers. Glass should be used strategically, ideally after the card scoring to maximize benefits. The Kings add +4 each, and I also have Spare Trousers giving +6 and Mystic providing +15. Plus, Supernova will multiply the hand played!\n**Calculating poker strategy**\n\nI’m diving deep into how Supernova and multipliers work, especially with Two Pair. It adds +1 multiplier for that hand, while the Spare Trousers gives a current bonus of +6. The glass effects change when I score. For my current hand, I see the Kings boost my multiplier significantly. After scoring my cards and applying the held effects, I end up with a final multiplier around 80.85. If I win, I can create a planet card afterward! I need to play strategically while keeping track of my J♠!\n**Optimizing hand order**\n\nI’m thinking about rearranging the order of my played cards to get the best multiplier before using any x multipliers. In the scoring stage, Kings add +4 each regardless of order, which is good since we don't have glass or any lucky triggers to consider. The chips from the played cards won’t be affected by the order, so I’ll focus on playing the Two Pair for a strong hand. I estimate around 11.4k chips, so I'll go with 11,400 for my action. I'll play the hand with the positions 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Let's do it!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,7]"}
