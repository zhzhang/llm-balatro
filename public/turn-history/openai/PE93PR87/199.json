{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI think something important happened during the pack step that should influence my decisions for the boss fight. I’m considering keeping my money for a reroll, or possibly rerolling the shop for just $5, although that would leave me with nothing. It might be better to focus on scoring by rearranging the jokers in the optimal order since the scoring depends on their placement. I’m trying to remember how each joker interacts with the scoring rules, especially in terms of independence and effects.\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nIt seems that chips and multipliers are calculated separately before being multiplied together. The chips from Scary Face provide an addition, while the multipliers from Smiley contribute independently. Their interaction only occurs during the final multiplication. As cards score, they sequentially add chips and trigger jokers. I have to keep in mind how to maximize these multipliers. For example, I think I should place the Constellation joker to the right of the additive multipliers for optimal scoring.\n**Arranging the jokers for scoring**\n\nI realize that the independent jokers activate from left to right, so arranging them properly is key. I think we should start with Splash for the +50 chips, then consider where Scary Face and Smiley fit in since their order doesn’t matter in this context. I need to make sure that all the additive multipliers come before the xmult joker, Constellation, to maximize the final score. So the order will be Splash, Scary, Spare, Popcorn, Constellation, and finally, Smiley.\n**Finalizing strategy for scoring**\n\nI need to remember that Smiley isn't independent and adds its multiplier during the scoring phase before the independent jokers. Constellation is an independent xmult that comes next. The order of on-scored jokers matters since Scary Face will add chips after scoring, but Smiley adds a multiplier. I’m also weighing whether to sell a consumable to buy Lovers or Venus, but maybe I should stick with what I have. I’ll focus on selecting the round for the next move!\n**Preparing for the boss fight**\n\nI need to make sure I have $10 ready, so I can reroll if the boss turns out to be \"The Plant\" or \"The Head.\" Since the boss is currently blind to me, I won't know until the round selection reveals who I’m up against. Once I see the boss, I’ll be able to decide whether to reroll. I’ll plan my next action based on that information, depending on what I encounter!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
