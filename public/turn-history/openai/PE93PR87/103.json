{"reasoning":"**Analyzing card mechanics**\n\nI’m trying to clarify how the Balatro negative edition works. It gives +1 joker slot while also increasing joker slots by one—confirmed by the secondary description. \n\nThen, there's the Luchador polychrome multiplier of x1.5 and the option to sell it to disable the boss, but it's mainly kept for its multiplier. \n\nNow, regarding the shop's \"Shoot the Moon\": each Queen held gives a substantial +13 multiplier. I see we have only 2 Queens left in the deck, so that might limit potential.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nHolding both Queens gives a +26 multiplier if they’re in hand at play time but unplayed, which can be tricky for forming a full house or two pair. \n\nWith Splash, we technically don’t need them in our hand. I realize we depend on Queens and Kings often, but we can create a full house with other ranks since we have various cards, like five nines. \n\nStill, with only 2 Queens, maxing out at +26 is critical. \"Shoot the Moon\" could surpass other options if we manage to hold onto at least two Queens.\n**Considering card options**\n\nI’m thinking about how this new option works even with discards and whether it could replace \"Mystic Summit,\" which costs $5. To buy it, I'd need to free up a slot, likely by selling Mystic Summit for $2 and then having $11 left to spend. \n\nI also see that \"Ice Cream\" adds +100 chips, decreasing by 5 chips each hand; it's strong early on. However, since we’ve built up chips from Splash, that may still add value. \n\nYet, I'd need to consider how discarding picks for \"Mega Buffoon\" might affect the game since it requires slots for new jokers.\n**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI'm considering if I can skip picks, but buying boosters in this interface could be risky while presenting the current state. With $9, purchasing \"Shoot the Moon\" or \"Ice Cream\" seems solid.\n\nThe Arcana pack costs $4 and offers immediate tarot, which could enhance economy or deck modifications. We only have one consumable slot free, but since Arcana is used immediately, it shouldn’t occupy a slot afterward. \n\nAs for the Voucher Tarot Merchant at $10, I need to sell something to reach that. It could increase tarot frequency, boosting scaling constellations and enhancements. Is it worth it?\n**Weighing options and impacts**\n\nI'm considering our ante of 5 and the potential moves we can make. We used Uranus for x1.5 scaling, and while planets are beneficial, the Tarot Merchant won't help us increase them; we need a Planet Merchant, which isn’t available. \n\nReplacing Mystic Summit with \"Shoot the Moon\" sounds appealing, especially since we want to manage discards. I can evaluate other jokers like Splash and Supernova for their impact on scoring. \n\nKeeping both Steel Jack and Queens in hand could be tricky since it would limit the cards I can play. While \"Ice Cream\" adds +100 chips per hand, it does decay over time and may even drop below zero. If I sell Mystic Summit to buy Ice Cream, I’d gain significant chip value upfront. Considering our high multipliers, Ice Cream likely offers more immediate benefits, even though \"Shoot the Moon\" can enhance multipliers further. Balancing these options is essential for maximizing effectiveness.\n**Sorting strategy and purchases**\n\nI'm diving into how many multipliers we have—like Supernova adding times played to the multiplier. For two pair, it adds +2; for full house, +7. With Constellation and Luchador both at x1.5, I'm seeing how beneficial Ice Cream's +100 chips can be, especially since it would replace Mystic Summit. \n\nWhile Ice Cream helps chip scaling, I have to keep in mind that it decays per hand. Maybe the Mega Buffoon pack could yield better jokers, but it costs $8. The Arcana pack is $4, allowing me to get tarot immediately as well. I’d need to sell Mystic Summit first since my joker slots are full.\n\nIt seems sensible to prioritize selling Mystic Summit, then buy Ice Cream and potentially grab the Arcana pack. I’m also considering whether to rearrange my jokers for optimal multiplier effect, ensuring that x multipliers are at the end. Ultimately, Ice Cream can fit anywhere, but keeping it early might make sense for now.\n**Deciding on joker order**\n\nIf I sell Mystic to buy Ice Cream, my order changes to Splash, Spare, Supernova, Constellation, Luchador, and Ice Cream. Ice Cream will occupy the last slot, which is fine since it doesn’t add to the multipliers.\n\nI want to make sure that the x multipliers are in good positions since they should ideally come after any additive multipliers—but even if Ice Cream is at the end, that won't cause problems. It seems best to proceed with selling Mystic first, then buy Ice Cream after. Let's go ahead with that!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
