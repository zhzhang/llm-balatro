{"reasoning":"**Clarifying full house rules**\n\nI’m in a shop with $8, and there's an open joker slot for 5/6. The spare trousers cost $6. I’m thinking about full house rules: it actually consists of three of a kind plus a pair, not two pairs. So with cards like AAAKK, I realize it contains one pair (KK) and three of a kind but doesn’t have two distinct pairs. I need to check if a full house can form two pairs and, yes, it can with the right cards.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m figuring out that Spare Trousers trigger when my played hand contains Two Pair. Since a full house contains a pair, it will trigger too, which is great! This means I can scale up my multiplier every time I play a full house. I just sold Half Joker and now I can buy Spare Trousers, leaving me with $2. I could also get a booster, though it’s limited. The voucher is too expensive, so my best move is to buy Spare Trousers. I'll output the purchase as JSON format.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
