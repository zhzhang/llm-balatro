{"reasoning":"**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI'm figuring out my options at the shop with just $1. Since I can't buy anything that costs $3 or more, I might consider rearranging jokers to optimize their effects—especially since I can't reroll. I need to assess how the different jokers score from left to right and if the order is critical. The Mystic Summit joker may give a +15 multiplier when there are no discards remaining. It seems like some jokers, like the Smiley face, trigger effects based on played cards, so I have to manage them wisely.\n**Analyzing jokers for optimal scoring**\n\nI've got the Mystic joker adding +15 to the multiplier, followed by Luchador at x1.5 and Constellation at x1. The order of these jokers matters if Mystic applies before the multipliers since we want additive effects first. Smiley should definitely go first among scored jokers since it adds to the multiplier from face cards. It's important that this happens before applying the independent multipliers. So Mystic should come before Luchador and Constellation, potentially even followed by the Certificate, for the best outcome.\n**Deciding on joker order and actions**\n\nThe Certificate triggers at the beginning of the round, so I think it might be passive or not significant to play order. I wonder if it combines with others in the independent category, but its timing seems set. It might be better to keep Smiley at the forefront for scoring, especially since it impacts scored jokers. With money being low, I’m considering selling Mystic or Smiley. However, selling scaling or multipliers doesn't feel right; it's better to stick with the current strategy.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
