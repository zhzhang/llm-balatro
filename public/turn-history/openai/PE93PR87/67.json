{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategies in-game**\n\nI’m considering how the Constellation ability gives a +1 slot as a secondary effect, possibly due to a negative aspect. Maybe it's smart to keep the strong multiplier from Luchador polychrome until it's needed. I also have a Justice consumable available, but it comes with risks. Now, since I’m in the shop with no cards to target, my next move should likely be buying the Celestial pack to get planets for leveling up my full house and boosting the Constellation multiplier.\n**Considering game strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about the Wheel of Fortune option, which has a 25% chance of adding an edition to a random joker, and it could potentially upgrade my Constellation. But there's a risk of hitting a negative edition, and I already have a few editions like Splash foil and Luchador polychrome. The cost is low at $3, so it might be worth it.  \n\nThen there's the Mail-In Rebate Joker, giving $5 for discarding 7 rank changes. Our strategy often involves discarding, but Mystic Summit encourages playing them down to zero. While this rebate isn't crucial, it could support our economy later when we need money for antes. Since we're maxed out on jokers, it might make sense to swap one, perhaps the Certificate, which seems less valuable now.\n**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm realizing that Spare increases the multiplier each time my hand has two pairs, and since a full house contains two pairs, it actually triggers Spare Trousers. This is why I saw it increase from +2 to +4 during the boss fight, making it quite valuable for scaling. Mystic Summit gives a massive +15 multiplier, and Splash is critical because all played cards count, plus it adds 50 chips.  \n\nThe Certificate adds a card with a seal, which could be useful for retriggers. I'm wondering if the mail-in rebate might not be as good as Certificate, but since we need more funds, especially with only $24 left after the boss, I need to think about future investments for packs and rerolls.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m thinking that the mail-in rebate could improve our economy with discards, but we have limited discards available. With Mystic, we usually reduce discards to zero each round, so triggering the rebate might not be reliable due to rank changes each round. It probably isn't worth replacing the Certificate or Mystic, so I'll skip that option and focus on the Celestial pack first.  \n\nI need to make sure we stay within our action limit; I'll go for the buy_booster command to purchase the Celestial pack, which costs $4. After buying, we’ll enter pack selection, and since the planet from the pack is used immediately and doesn't occupy a slot, we should be good to go!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
