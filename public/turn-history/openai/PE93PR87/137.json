{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI'm considering whether leveling high card can be beneficial, especially in Balatro, where some bosses limit hand types. We recently faced the ante 6 boss. I realize that Luchador’s ability can help cancel the boss's effects. Choosing Pluto for high card seems viable since it activates frequently. However, Jupiter offers better upgrades, including a +2 multiplier. Yet, the flush may not be played much, and I find myself weighing the risks and benefits of both options.\n**Analyzing flush and card choices**\n\nI'm considering leveling up Flush to gain a +2 multiplier and +15 chips, making the flush base chips 65 with a base multiplier of 8. This could yield decent outcomes, especially if we can force a flush through discards and suit focus, but that seems tricky. I lean towards Pluto because it offers a fallback with high card scoring, while Supernova might increase our chip gain over time. However, Jupiter also stands out, as it offers a straightforward way to assemble flushes. The deck composition doesn't exactly favor flush plays, which makes it all a bit complicated.\n**Choosing card pack**\n\nI’m thinking about buying a second celestial pack, hoping to get Uranus for a two-pair combination. But for now, I’ve decided to stick with Pluto. It seems like the best choice for the current situation. So, my next action will be to select card pack 1. Let's see how this plays out! It feels like a good strategy to keep options open while focusing on immediate gains with Pluto.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
