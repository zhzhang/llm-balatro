{"reasoning":"**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m in a shop and need to decide on purchases. Right now, I've got a full jokers deck and half of my consumables for Justice. I'm considering getting the Chariot tarot for $3 to boost my strategy, but I know that I can only use it if I purchase it for my consumables inventory. Alternatively, I could buy the jumbo celestial pack for $6, which can provide immediate benefits. The jumbo celestial seems like a strong choice as it increases constellation values and offers planet cards I can use right away.\n**Budgeting for purchases**\n\nI have $13, which allows me to buy the Chariot, Celestial, and Spectral packs for a total of $13. However, I wonder if I should save some money for interest, which kicks in at $5 increments. The upcoming boss might require stronger scaling since we're already scoring well with a big blind, maybe around 10k+ or even 40k. Given that and the risks with the Spectral pack, it likely makes more sense to prioritize the Celestial for synergy and buy the Chariot. Buying both would leave me $4, which I could choose to keep for interest instead.\n**Considering purchases and strategy**\n\nI’m thinking that the Spectral pack might be risky, so I wonder if I should just reroll, but that doesn’t seem necessary right now. Instead, I could also consider using Justice, but it requires a target hand, and I can’t do that now, so I should save it. I’ll buy the Jumbo Celestial pack first because it doesn’t take up a slot and buffs my constellation. After purchasing, I’ll likely be prompted to choose a planet, so I’ll focus on buying the booster next!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
