{"reasoning":"**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI'm considering the scoring mechanics, specifically that having two pair gives a +2 multiplier and currently a +24 multiplier. It seems these will be added independently. Using a Supernova boosts the multiplier based on the hand played, so if I play two pair, that's an extra +10 multiplier per play. The current hand ranks show that I don't have two pair yet, so I might need to discard to get pairs or just go for a high card and aim for 52k chips over a few hands.\n**Considering hand strategies**\n\nIt's the big blind phase with five hands, and I can afford to discard cards to try for two pair or a full house for a bigger win. Although, I wonder if the deck is modified or not? With the Pareidolia mechanic, scary face triggers apply. Each played face card yields +30 chips, and since Pareidolia considers all cards faces, that means scoring with all five cards could be substantial. Hand type seems less significant for chip totals, but I can still explore playing for a high card.\n**Calculating chip totals**\n\nWith the Splash mechanic, all five cards count towards my total. So I need to combine base hand chips with sum card values and any bonuses, which might include an additional +50 chips from the Splash. The Splash description suggests it adds +50 chips independently, potentially linked to its foil edition. \n\nLet’s estimate my expected high card chips: starting with a base of 25, then adding card values plus the +30 from Scary Face. If I play high-value cards like A♦, J♣, 10♣, 9♦, and 8♠, I could reach a total of 223 chips and a base multiplier of 3, which could be additive depending on my plays.\n**Calculating total multipliers**\n\nI have a base multiplier from Constellation of 3 and another 3 from Supernova, leading to a total multiplier of 6, then multiplied by 2.1, giving me about 12.6. There don't seem to be any other jokers affecting this. My estimated chips total around 2800, but previously scored 15k with a high card, which suggests I'm missing something significant.\n\nIt could be that the Scary Face bonus isn’t adding enough. It seems I need a higher multiplier or chip value, even considering Spare Trousers, which grants a +24 multiplier. It appears to apply independently, accumulating throughout the game.\n**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m considering Splash’s effect, which states that every played card counts in scoring. This seems to imply that all cards contribute to the total, but I wonder if the base hand chips for a high card are higher than 25. Scary Face gives +30 chips per face card in hand, but I need to double-check how Pareidolia affects that.\n\nThere’s a possibility that Splash provides +50 chips as part of its inherent effect. So, calculating the total chips, it looks like I would have around 273 chips before applying any multipliers. However, I’m estimating future hands will yield around 14k to 17k in chips based on previous results. I’ll proceed with the intended hand of high card and play those cards!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,6,8]"}
