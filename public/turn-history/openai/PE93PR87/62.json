{"reasoning":"**Calculating game score**\n\nI need to score 4000 in 4 hands, but I might be able to hit that in one hand using a full house and jokers. \n\nIf I play a full house with KKK and JJ or JJJ and KK, I should calculate everything. With the Splash rule, all 5 cards count. My base chips start at 90, and I sum the values of all 5 cards. \n\nSo, with 3 kings and 2 jacks, I get 190 chips total, which gets multiplied by 8.\n**Evaluating scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m considering if I can add +2 from Spare Trousers, which independently boosts the current multiplier and scales when two pairs are present. A full house indeed contains two pairs, so it should trigger, granting that +2 boost and increasing its multiplier from +2 to +4 before scoring. \n\nI think during this hand, the current multiplier would be +4. Plus, if there are no discards, Mystic Summit gives +15, and other boosters may help too. I'll weigh all those in my scoring considerations.\n**Evaluating enhancement options**\n\nWith the Splash rule, I can boost my multiplier by +4 when scoring, which is significant. Using Empress on two cards like the King of Hearts and Jack of Hearts would add +8 to my hand, and that's quite beneficial without any risks.\n\nI could also apply Justice to the Glass card for a x2 multiplier, but I need to be cautious since it has a 1 in 4 chance of being destroyed. I think we might win just by playing two pairs and using Mystic, especially considering that all five cards count with Splash.\n**Finalizing scoring strategy**\n\nI’m calculating my chips. It looks like I have about 71 plus a Splash of 50, which gives me a total of 141. My base multiplier is 2, but since I have two pairs, Spare Trousers increases it to +4, making it total 6. \n\nIf Mystic has 0 discards, I get +15, which leads to 21, and multiplying gives me around 5330 chips—enough to meet my target! But I need to be cautious about my remaining discards because using them might risk breaking my two pairs.\n**Deciding on card enhancements**\n\nI think it’s best to use Empress after I discard some cards. I want to apply it to my two key Kings to boost their multipliers permanently. I’ll choose the King of Hearts in position 2 and the King of Clubs in position 6. \n\nAfter that, I’ll discard, aiming for a third King, Jack, or a high kicker for a possible flush or straight. The first discard will be the low cards (4♠ and 5♣), and then I'll use Empress to enhance those Kings before drawing new cards. Let's go ahead with using Empress now!\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,2,6]"}
