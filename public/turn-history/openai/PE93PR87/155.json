{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game options**\n\nI'm currently deciding on whether to play in a blind select game. We're at Ante7 small, needing 35k in funds, but we’ve got $0 right now. Skipping the game gives a voucher tag for the next shop, while playing nets a $3 reward. I realize that skipping might lead to more valuable tags, but I’d miss out on shopping opportunities. Free vouchers and uncommon jokers are tempting, but I need to weigh the potential reward against missing other benefits.\n**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about our build, which relies on face cards, but the upcoming boss flips them face down. That complicates things since we can't see their ranks, which could hinder our chances of forming two pairs or a full house. I note that rerolling the boss costs $10, and right now we're at $0. I realize I need to earn some money in earlier blinds to afford that reroll. So, I should probably play through the small and big rounds to gather funds and consider buying something helpful from the shop.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
