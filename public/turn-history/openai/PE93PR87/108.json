{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nSo, I'm looking at what I can do in the shop with only $2. I can't buy anything since the first two items are too expensive. I could sell some items to get more cash, but it seems like shooting for the moon won't fit my current build. It wouldn't be worth it trying to hold onto queens for extra scoring, so, hmm, maybe the best choice is to go to the next round and save up some cash!\n**Analyzing end-of-round decisions**\n\nAt the end of the round, I'm thinking about interest based on my money. With only $2, I won't earn any interest. Selling something could help me reach $5 for some interest, but I need to consider what to sell carefully. Selling Justice doesn’t feel right since it could be useful later. Ice Cream offers +100 chips but decays over time. Even with losses, it’s worthwhile. Luchador’s multipliers are independent, so keeping everything makes sense for maximizing my value!\n**Examining card mechanics**\n\nI'm analyzing how Constellation works with its scaling and extra slots. It seems the negative edition gives an additional joker slot, but it might already account for an extra slot in the description. So, do I have 8 slots total? The max jokers displayed is 6, which is confusing. As for our next action, I’m considering the order of jokers and ensuring the multiplicatives are correctly applied. I'll use the sequence: Splash, Ice Cream, Spare Trousers, Supernova, Constellation, and Luchador since it aligns with their mechanics!\n**Reviewing scoring mechanics**\n\nTo optimize my play, I want Supernova's additive multiplier to activate before the x multipliers, which means it should come before Constellation and Luchador. Spare Trousers modifies itself based on the hand, adding to its multiplier when two pair are played; it can gain +2 Mult permanently. The gain happens during the played category, so the order isn't too crucial for that. Splash is passive, counting every played card without order dependence. Now, I should consider the round selection and prepare for the upcoming boss in Round 9, staying mindful of the blinds involved!\n**Clarifying round structure**\n\nEach blind corresponds to a round, so in Ante 5 at Round 9, we might be at the small blind for that ante. I'm trying to confirm whether it's Ante 5/8, but it seems likely we should consider it as small blind of Ante 5 for this round. Alright, I'll proceed with this understanding!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
