{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game mechanics**\n\nI’m noticing our build seems focused on full house strategies because we have two levels of full house and three of a kind. Mystic Summit allows using all discards which could be manageable, plus it gives a huge multiplier. Luchador offers a decent multiplier too. I'm wondering if Half Joker might help, but it only works for 3 or fewer cards, and we often play 5-card hands. Hmm, shifting to 3-card hands like three of a kind could be promising.\n**Analyzing chip mechanics**\n\nOkay, Sly Joker requires a pair for scoring, and since three of a kind contains a pair, that gives me +50 chips. But only those three cards contribute, which isn't a lot. I can still meet thresholds, but later rounds might need more chips from 5-card hands. I'm also considering Spare Trousers, which benefits from two pairs, but with our current focus on full houses, it could be stronger to stick with those. While two pairs scale well, I think sticking to full houses might be wiser. But the chips can become a limitation.\n**Considering chip strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about adding more chip jokers, like Bull, but they're not available. I noticed there's a voucher called Hieroglyph, which reduces the ante by 1 and limits hands by 1 each round. Reducing the ante from 3 to 2 would significantly ease chip requirements, which sounds great. Losing one hand might not be a big deal, especially since our scoring is pretty high. Hieroglyph seems strong in balancing the rounds, giving extra shop time while managing fewer hands. Seems like a solid move!\n**Exploring purchase options**\n\nWith Mystic Summit, I could rely on discards for high scoring, so fewer hands might work out fine. This is possibly the best purchase, but it costs $10 and leaves me with just $1. I can't buy Half Joker directly. I could buy a voucher and maybe sell Sly, but we have a six-capacity limit. If I buy Hieroglyph, I might still want Half Joker and Spare Trousers. However, I realize I can't buy more than one unless I sell a joker since I'm already at five. Wait—does Constellation provide an extra slot?\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nIt looks like I can only buy one new joker since the maximum is six. Half Joker boosts 3-card hands with a +20 multiplier, while Spare Trousers scales well. Currently, I have a strong multiplier from Full House. Half Joker could allow for a powerful three of a kind, providing significant chips—around 7920! But I need to make sure I can form these hands. Since I have the budget, I think buying Half Joker is the best move, then maybe consider a booster pack later!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
