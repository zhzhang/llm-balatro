{"reasoning":"**Considering poker strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about how the supernova description adds the number of times a poker hand has been played to the multiplier. If I play a full house, it adds +7 to my total, which is significant! But the joker slot is full—so which joker to replace? The Gluttonous Joker seems weak with only +3. Selling that for $2 to buy Supernova could be a solid choice since it gives a consistent +7 multiplier for my hand. Plus, I might leverage boosters for extra multipliers!\n**Exploring card strategy**\n\nI’m considering the Full House planet, which might be \"Earth,\" as it could boost my chips and multiplier. Buying a celestial pack seems strong, while the spectral pack offers powerful mods like Immolate and Hex, but it's risky. I’ve got $15, enough for both Supernova and Chariot. Buying boosters lets me choose and use immediately without taking up a slot, which is neat! The Chariot enhances a selected card but may occupy a slot if bought as a tarot consumable.\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI can’t use the buy_and_use command since it requires a target, but I’m noticing I can buy cards instead. The Chariot is in the card section, but purchasing it would place it in my consumable inventory, which is already full at two slots. I’d need to sell or use something first. Justice could double a card's multiplier, but it’s risky, while the Sun might help with hearts, though it's less useful right now. Maybe selling the Sun for $1 could create space for the Chariot, which enhances a Steel card's multiplier!\n**Strategizing card play**\n\nI’m realizing that since I often play 5 cards, keeping the Steel card in hand while playing others can multiply my total by 1.5 each hand—super powerful! I can create the Steel card, but with Splash, I might want to play as many scoring cards as possible. However, the Steel card remains effective when held, not played. In Balatro, once I play a hand, I discard selected cards but can keep Steel if I never play it. That’s a great strategy!\n**Planning card purchases**\n\nThe Chariot is definitely valuable for setting up a permanent x1.5 multiplier per hand. To buy it, I need the target card in hand, but I can't see my hand during the shop phase. Instead, I can use the tarot to target cards in my deck, but that requires careful planning. I’m considering selling the Gluttonous card to afford my purchases, which could include Supernova, Chariot, and other items. \n\nI’ll need to prioritize my multipliers, making sure to maintain an effective order during play to maximize results. Getting the order and cards right will be key!\n**Deciding card actions**\n\nIn Balatro, I see that the Polychrome joker grants a x1.5 multiplier to all hands. The standard Luchador only provides a benefit for boss battles and doesn't offer a multiplier unless it’s the Polychrome version. I’ll keep it since it can boost the multiplier. My plan is to sell the Sun and Gluttonous Joker to create space and funds, allowing me to buy Supernova, Chariot, and the booster packs. \n\nI’ll start by selling the Sun; it seems like the least valuable option and will open up a slot for the Chariot. Let's proceed with that!\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
