{"reasoning":"**Evaluating blind select strategy**\n\nI’m at the blind select for Big Blind Ante 2, considering whether to play or skip for a tag. Skipping seems risky since I'd miss my chance to shop, and skipping the blind means I wouldn't get to shop afterwards. If I skip, I go straight to the boss, but I've just shopped and have $1. Winning the big blind gives me $4, then I can shop before facing the boss, which could help with scaling Constellation.\n**Considering boss strategy**\n\nThe boss debuffs cards played earlier, and since I used Aces and Jacks in the ante 2 small blind, those would be affected. I could sell my Luchador to negate the boss debuff, but that requires the boss to be active. Luchador provides a nice boost, so maybe I should hold onto it for now. Skipping the big blind for the Spectral pack might provide strong modifications. However, facing the boss with the same deck and limited money feels risky, even though the threshold is manageable.\n**Analyzing boss strategy**\n\nI need a bigger hand or to use Mystic Summit for a +15 multiplier to reach the 1600 threshold against the boss. With no remaining discards and maybe using Smiley, I could surpass 1600 even with Aces and Jacks debuffed. But debuffed cards contribute zero chips and can’t trigger abilities like Smiley’s multiplier. So, Jacks won't contribute chips, and Aces will give nothing too, meaning my best combos may not work unless I use unplayed cards — and I need to keep track of those!\n**Developing boss strategy**\n\nI see that I can avoid playing certain cards since the boss doesn’t debuff others. For the big blind, I want to beat 1200 while using minimal and low-value cards to save my stronger ones for later. Instead of Aces and Jacks, maybe I could use face cards like Kings and Queens. However, if I play them now, they’d be debuffed against the boss. Skipping the big blind or using Luchador looks like better options. I could use Mystic Summit and other boosts to craft a strong hand for the boss!\n**Deciding on strategy for boss**\n\nThe Certificate gives an extra sealed card, which is useful. Skipping the big blind means losing $4 and my chance to shop but gains a Spectral pack that might be more valuable. However, I can shop after beating the boss. Playing the big blind means I need to score 1200, but using low-value cards could work. I can save face cards for later. Since debuffing only affects previously played cards, I might play Aces and Jacks again. Discarding low-value cards can help trigger Mystic Summit for a multiplier boost. I’m feeling good about this plan!\n**Rearranging jokers for optimal play**\n\nI’m thinking about the order of my jokers: Mystic, Smiley, Luchador, Constellation, Certificate. It’s crucial to organize them for additive before multiplicative effects. Smiley triggers during scoring, while Mystic and Luchador are independent effects, and Luchador offers its own multiplier. I want Mystic (+15) before Luchador and Constellation. The arrangement seems fine since Certificate’s position isn’t critical. So, I believe the best order is still Mystic, Smiley, Luchador, Constellation, and Certificate. Next, I’ll execute the action to play the round!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
