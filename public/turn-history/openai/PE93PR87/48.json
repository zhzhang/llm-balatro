{"reasoning":"**Clarifying poker strategy**\n\nI’m analyzing the phrase about creating the Planet card for the final poker hand if it's held in hand. It means the card needs to be unplayed when the final hand is played. I want to reach 3000 for the blind, which I can do in one or two hands. I’m considering using all three remaining discards to set up Mystic Summit, but I need to discard each card to improve hand quality while retaining important cards.\n**Analyzing poker hands and bonuses**\n\nI’m considering the possibility of making a full house with a combination like 10,10,10 and A,A. That would trigger \"Sly,\" since a full house contains a Pair and Three of a Kind. If I play that hand, I’d gain +50 chips. Now, potentially triggering \"Spare Trousers\": a full house has two pairs, which means it gains +2 mult permanently. The description suggests this bonus permanently increases the internal multiplier, adding to my overall score.\n**Calculating potential poker gains**\n\nI’m trying to figure out when \"Spare Trousers\" triggers, and it seems like it activates during the \"on played\" step before scoring. If my hand contains a Two Pair, it gains +2 Mult and will apply that to the same hand, so that's great! Mystic Summit also adds +15 Mult if there are no discards left. I estimate winning the blind with a full house, bringing my total chips to 167 after calculating card chips.\n**Evaluating poker chip calculations**\n\nI'm checking for any other chip additions, but it looks like none are available. My base Mult is 6, and with \"Spare Trousers,\" that goes to +2, bringing it to 8. Currently, Mystic Summit isn't active because there are discards left. The final calculation shows that I need to reach 3000 chips, and to do so, I need to play my remaining three discards to reach zero, while keeping my valuable cards. However, I worry that discarding might disrupt my full house.\n**Deciding on discarding strategy**\n\nI'm realizing that when I discard cards, I should only remove those I don't need, keeping the 10s and Aces in hand. I can safely discard K♦ and unsealed 9♦, while ensuring sealed 9 remains. With three discards available, I can discard one card each time, but I want to minimize potential play disruptions. I'll first discard K♦ and then reassess. It’s important to keep sealed 9 for the final hand, ensuring I play my full house with three 10s and two Aces, aiming to maximize my chances.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5]"}
