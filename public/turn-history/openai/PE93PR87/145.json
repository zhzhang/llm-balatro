{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI'm considering whether the prompt \"Sell this card to disable the current Boss Blind\" will actually disable it. The game still shows a boss description, so maybe the effect is muted? I'm not sure if we can say it's disabled for sure. Anyway, we need to beat 40k, and with our current state of 5 hands, 4 discards, and 0 chips, I'm strategizing. Our deck has some interesting multipliers, like Splash, Even Steven, and Spare Trousers. I'm estimating our pairs might score around 10k each, or possibly more.\n**Calculating game strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing our game situation and realize we've already had a +18 multiplier before the boss. To reach that 40k target, I think we need either four hands scoring 10k or just two lucky hands of 20k each. With our Justice consumable, we can create a glass card with a double multiplier and a 25% chance to destroy. My current hand is looking promising: I have pairs of aces and threes, which lets us play Two Pair. I need to add a fifth card to boost our multiplier, ideally picking from the even cards available.\n**Evaluating card choices**\n\nI'm figuring out my best card options since Splash counts all played cards. If I play the 10♦, 4♥, or 2♣, each gives a +4 multiplier. The 2♣ is tempting because it provides $3 when scored, but playing it also helps me earn that money immediately. If I hold onto it until the round ends, I still get $3. So, I’ll play 2♣ with my Two Pair, which will give me five cards: A♣, A♦, 3♠, 3♦, and 2♣. Supernova should add a nice multiplier based on how many times I've played this hand.\n**Understanding Joker mechanics**\n\nI'm trying to get a handle on how the Joker works with Two Pair. It looks like playing a hand with Two Pair grants a +2 multiplier and possibly adds that to the current +18 multiplier when I reach step 5. So, if I play it, my future hands might have a total of +20. The idea is that this effect kicks in immediately when the hand is played, enhancing my score right before calculations. Spare Trousers adds a similar benefit, acting almost like a scaling multiplier—first increasing, then applying its new value.\n**Strategizing with Jokers and cards**\n\nThe Joker mechanics indicate that \"on played\" effects activate before scoring, so Spare Trousers increases before scoring is calculated. I need a solid hand, and including even cards like 10♦ boosts my multiplier with Splash. Playing the 2♣ gives some immediate cash, but I’m weighing the benefits of keeping it for end-round scoring. I realize we start with eight cards, play five, and then draw five more.\n\nUsing Justice to enhance a card into Glass can significantly boost my score. If I target 10♦, it will double my multiplier when scored. It’s risky since there's a destruction chance, but with good strategies in place, it could pay off well! I'm feeling cautiously optimistic about this approach.\n**Planning the next move**\n\nI'm considering whether we can win in two hands without risking our position against the boss, since the boss can reduce our hand level after each play. It's better to win quickly, and using glass on a card like 10♦ could help us do that. I'm deciding to use the Justice consumable on the 10♦ to enhance its multiplier.\n\nAfter that, I'll play my intended hand of A♣, A♦, 3♠, 3♦, and the glistening 10♦ as a Two Pair. This should help maximize my chips for a better score, so I'll proceed with the action to use the consumable.\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,7]"}
