{"reasoning":"**Evaluating joker sacrifice**\n\nLosing 8 multiplier chips seems relatively minor, but the requirement to sell a joker means we'll lose some effects. I'm leaning toward sacrificing Splash, as it gives +50 chips and enhances face triggers and extra cards. However, Splash plays a crucial role in scoring with two pairs. Maybe Scary Face is a better option since it only gives +30 chips per face card. I should probably go with Scary Face, which appears to be the weakest joker in this scenario.\n**Considering strategic gameplay**\n\nIf we play small or big, that could allow us to earn more money, but it does come with the risk of not beating the boss. The goal is to reach 100k chips, which might be easier with Spare Trousers and by playing extra two pairs. If I average 30k per hand, hitting 100k across five hands seems feasible. However, Selling Scary Face might drop our chips per hand. I need to estimate how quickly we can scale and adapt to any unlucky draws.\n**Calculating multipliers and strategy**\n\nPlaying two pairs gives a +2 multiplier to Spare Trousers. If we play around 3-4 two pairs in small and big blinds, we could gain a total of +8 to +12 multipliers. This could offset the -8 from popcorn decay across two rounds. However, while I could intentionally play extra hands, it makes sense to keep them for the end of the round. Winning in two hands should suffice, so I’ll likely scale back the number of extra plays needed. Ultimately, both strategies might yield similar net multipliers.\n**Weighing options for practice and purchases**\n\nI’m thinking playing is beneficial for practice, but I realize skipping would prevent me from shopping between small and big blinds. If I play small first, then shop, my $1 plus a $3 reward might let me buy something like the Star tarot for $3, which could improve my suit for the moon. Plus, if I visit the small blind shop, I might buy a planet card to increase my hand level. This could potentially boost my chips and multipliers, especially for two pair levels.\n**Planning for gameplay and strategy**\n\nSince I have no money initially, playing the small blind could yield at least $3, and perhaps more from remaining hands. Winning two out of four or five hands might lead to a total of $8 after interest. In the shop, I could purchase a planet card to increase my hand value, boosting base chips and multipliers. Playing small and big is essential for making meaningful purchases to help beat the boss. Skipping would forfeit that chance, so I definitely plan to play the small blind. I'll return my action as \"play_round.\"\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
