{"reasoning":"**Choosing action with caution**\n\nI'm considering starting with the wheel first, but there's a potential issue. It seems like it might apply an edition to a Constellation negative that I already have. I wonder if I can get another edition? In Balatro, jokers can only have one edition, and the wheel would pick a random joker without an edition. It could also add an edition to a random joker, but if it already has one, it might not do anything. Three of my jokers already have editions, so I'll proceed with the action: buy_and_use_consumable 2.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
