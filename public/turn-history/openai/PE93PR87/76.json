{"reasoning":"**Considering strategies for rerolls**\n\nI'm thinking about the D6 tag, which makes rerolls in the next shop start at $0 — that's powerful! However, I would miss out on the $4 and some interest. Currently, rerolls cost $6, but D6 might offer a lot of free rerolls to help me find key jokers or planets. If I skip big, I'd have to face the boss without a shop in between, but I believe I can manage that. If I go directly to the boss with $6, I would forgo a total of $7 reward. However, the D6 tag could help boost the next shop's value after the boss.\n**Analyzing strategy with Grabber tag**\n\nWith the Grabber +1, I believe the default hands are 4 at the start, making it 5 hands total for me since I have the tag. I'll likely make a good play with the first hand, and at ante 3, a full house scores 11,970, while ante 4 may yield something similar. Skipping the big means no shop before the boss, but I might want to use Justice glass on a card. Charm tag could be less valuable than D6, but if I play small first, I can earn $3 and have a shop before the boss, which could be helpful.\n**Weighing options for shop and tags**\n\nIf I skip the big, there won’t be a shop before the boss, so the last shop would be after the small round, which is fine. The D6 tag gives a reroll starting at $0; it could be more valuable in the next shop after the boss due to higher rarity. Alternatively, I could skip small for the charm, play big, and gain a shop with the mega arcana. This way, I can get an extra tarot pack without too much loss. However, if I skip small, I’d soon reach the big blind selection and must decide to skip or play, which locks in my choice. If I play big, I can’t return to small.\n**Evaluating D6 and charm strategy**\n\nI think I might want the D6 tag more than charm. I could skip small to get charm, then skip big for D6 and head to the boss. This approach gets me both tags and a shop after the boss with the D6 effect, plus a likely charm pack. However, I’d forgo both rewards initially, but I'd still start with $6 and aim for $11 after the boss win, which isn’t bad. The risk is if I fail the boss from unlucky draws with no shop to improve. Still, my build is strong with jokers and multipliers, so it feels safe. I need to keep in mind that Mystic Summit needs 0 discards, and I may need to manage discards to achieve a full house. It seems using all discards before my final hand would be ideal to maximize scoring.\n**Deciding between tags and discards**\n\nI’m considering whether to use all discards in every round before scoring my big hand or to hold onto some. For the Mystic Summit bonus, I need to have zero discards remaining to get that +15 multiplier. So, I must use my discards intelligently. The Spare Trousers require two pairs, which I don’t always have since a full house counts as three of a kind with one pair. \n\nI'll focus on maximizing my multipliers. Mystic Summit provides a substantial bonus, but I should calculate how much value I could get from the Mega Arcana pack compared to a small blind. Skipping small gives me a charm tag, while playing small gives $3. I might lean towards skipping small for the Mega Arcana. If I skip big. I can go for D6 and still face the boss with both tags later.\n**Planning strategy for boss encounter**\n\nCurrently, I have $6, and after the boss, I could get $5 more, plus any remaining hands. If I can one-shot the boss with my five hands, I might retain four of them and have $9 total, which could increase to $15 with interest. Skipping both seems fine, but the boss requires reaching 10k. If I can’t one-shot and need another hand, the “no repeat hand types” rule could complicate things. \n\nI must use my discards carefully to activate Mystic Summit, but that means sacrificing scoring opportunities. Playing a smaller hand earlier might help generate chips. However, that carries risks. Having a shop before the boss would help me upgrade hands or get tarot cards to manipulate my deck. Still, I'm thinking skipping small for the charm tag is the safest option and then playing big to ensure I can shop before the boss. So, I'll skip the small round now and note down the action in JSON: `{\"action\": \"skip_round\", \"positions\": null}`.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
