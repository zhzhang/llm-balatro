{"reasoning":"**Clarifying scoring mechanics**\n\nI need to consider the order for the \"on scored\" jokers during card scoring. This would lead to multiple additions first, while also allowing for independent jokers like the Luchador that has a secondary x1.5 multiplier - it triggers in category 5 after all cards are scored. The Mystic Summit also seems independent, and it looks like the Spare Trousers gains a +2 multiplier if played with two pairs. This means it adds to its multiplier before scoring, indicating it scales independently.\n**Understanding multiplier mechanics**\n\nWhen using Gluttonous, I add a multiplier during scoring, then independent jokers contribute after that. The xmult is independent and multiplies the final multiplier at the end of the step. So, having Gluttonous earlier doesn't prevent it from contributing to the final multiplier affected by xmult—this is crucial because xmult applies afterwards. Given this, the additive multiplier from Gluttonous will combine with others like Luchador and Constellation. I might need to rearrange the jokers for optimal order since the sequence of independent effects is essential for maximizing the bonuses!\n**Arranging jokers for optimal scoring**\n\nI should set up the order so that all +mult jokers come before xmult ones. My independent jokers include Spare Trousers and Mystic Summit as +mult, plus Splash, which gives +50 chips. Constellation and Luchador provide xmult. Galuttonous affects scoring triggers, but the others don't. For the independent stage, Splash adds chips, though its position relative to xmult may not be crucial since chips and multipliers are separate. Order is essential if one joker gives xmult and another offers +mult, so I’ll arrange it: Spare Trousers and Mystic Summit first, followed by Constellation and Luchador.\n**Finalizing card choice**\n\nI realized that some independent jokers might add multipliers based on chips, but during the scoring stage, it's crucial that \"on scored\" jokers are processed from left to right. That means Gluttonous should be the first joker I score to ensure its multiplier is added early. After that, I can handle the other jokers that multiply later. So, the command now needs to be to buy the card for Gluttonous; I’m all set to do that!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
