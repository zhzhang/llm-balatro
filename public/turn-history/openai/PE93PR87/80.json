{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about discarding A♣ to create a tarot in consumables, but if my hand is full, I can't do that. A♣ might be valuable for my potential pair of aces, especially since I already have A♠ and another pair with 4♠ and 4♥. So, with two pairs, I could trigger the spare trousers gain, which adds to the multiplier. It seems the spare trousers would give me a +2 multiplier when I play two pair, moving me to +6 overall.\n**Deciding on a card play**\n\nIt looks like I should play two pair now since I can score high with splash and bonus ace chips. With the splash, every played card counts towards the score, even if it's not in the hand, which is great! I can play five cards, combining aces, 4s, and a club to get a gluttonous +3. If I play A♠ (bonus), A♣ (club), and 4♠, 4♥, along with 7♣, that gives me two pair with 7♣ as a kicker. This could work really well! A full house is out of reach though.\n**Analyzing card options**\n\nI’m considering a spade flush with A♠, 5♠, and 4♠, but that doesn’t seem viable. So, two pair is my best option right now. While I could play just a pair of aces with extra cards, having two pair is a higher base hand and triggers the spare trousers effect. This also counts my two clubs for a +6 multiplier from gluttonous. Even with mystic summit inactive since I've discarded, I could still play the hand. I need to calculate my chips and multipliers carefully to see if I can exceed the 7500 requirement!\n**Calculating total chips and multipliers**\n\nOkay, so I'm getting a bonus enhancement of +30 extra chips upon scoring, plus the base value, which gives me 41 chips from A♠. Adding the values from 4♠, 4♥, and 7♣, that totals 67 chips. Including the hand chips of 20 means I have 87 chips. Now, with Splash adding 50 chips independently, that boosts my total to potentially 137. Also, foil editions grant additional chips. My starting multiplier is 2, and the Gluttonous Joker boosts it with +3 per club card scored.\n**Strategizing for a better hand**\n\nI’m looking at my setup with two clubs, A♣ and 7♣, giving me +6 multipliers. Spare trousers add +4, but Mystic Summit isn't active right now. I can use Luchador for a x1.5 multiplier, and then there's the Constellation giving x1.3. I've calculated that even with these multipliers, my total is falling short of 7500. \n\nI should consider discarding to aim for a full house, which could get around 9000 points. Since I have four discards, keeping my pair while discarding others might be the way to go. I could also play multiple hands, so maybe I should play two pair now and then work towards a stronger hand later!\n**Planning for a strong hand**\n\nI can’t draw another 4, so I need another ace; there are two left in the remaining deck of 49 cards, but I'm a bit confused. I thought our hand should exclude the cards we've drawn. It’s ambiguous if the deck count considers our hand too.\n\nRegardless, I can’t rely on those counts. Discarding A♣ creates a tarot card, but I’d lose my pair. Playing two pairs now could increase my trousers multiplier. My earlier full house scored 6375, so aiming above 7500 is my goal. \n\nThere are multiple strategies. I could discard to zero before my best play for Mystic Summit. This boost is significant, so I want to use all my discards quickly, then try to form a full house or another high-scoring hand. Using the discards at the start would help me maximize points for future hands.\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI can discard up to 5 cards, which leaves me with 3. I’m considering keeping my bonus ace and one pair, like aces or 4s, to help me aim for a full house. I need to balance discarding low-value cards while hoping to draw additional aces. If I keep my pairs intact, I can target creating three of a kind or another valid pair.\n\nWhile I want to activate Mystic Summit by using all discards, I should focus on maintaining strong cards in hand, especially considering that I already have valuable cards like A♣ and my bonus ace. Discarding my singletons now could help me set up a stronger hand later!\n**Deciding on discards**\n\nI can discard up to 5 cards, but I’m thinking about keeping my 7♣ for its multiplier benefit. If I keep it, I should consider discarding lower-value cards, like 5♠, J♦, and 6♦. I want to maintain flexibility with my pairs while still having enough room.\n\nSince keeping 7♣ adds to my multiplier, I'll go ahead and discard the others to draw new cards, ensuring I still have strong pairs to work with while leaving three discards left for later!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,7,8]"}
