{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategy**\n\nI’m thinking that if we can create two pair, we should definitely go for it, but we don’t have any pairs currently. Discarding could help us fish for either two pair or a full house. Maybe the simplest method is to discard three cards, but discards are limited. Since we need to beat 35k, we could also just play the best five cards now, perhaps going for a high card like Ace. I’m weighing the pros and cons!\n**Evaluating card options**\n\nI’m reflecting on how previous two pairs in ante6 scored around 22-23k, and considering the scaling Spare Trousers might help in ante7 to reach 35k. Right now, I don’t have any pairs. I’m thinking about discarding three non-synergistic cards—maybe going for a pair or even aiming for a straight with the 6♠ and 7♠. But I could also aim for a flush since I already have 9♦, 10♦, and 4♦. I need to weigh my options carefully!\n**Analyzing joker strategies**\n\nI’m looking at how our jokers work: Even Steven favors even ranks, Scary Face favors face cards, and Constellation gives a multiplier. Spare Trousers adds a base and can scale, while Supernova depends on hand type counts. I’m thinking that focusing on two pair or a full house might maximize the Supernova benefits—so it might be worth discarding cards that don't contribute to forming pairs. But hmm, we really need to think about how to retain duplicates effectively, since forming two pair is key!\n**Deciding on discards and redraws**\n\nI’m considering the option to discard five cards to completely redraw and aim for pairs. We have 5 discards available, and it might make sense to use one for a complete redraw. Keeping the strong 10♦ is tempting, but discarding it could mean losing that chance. However, I could also play it now to gain some quick chips. I’m thinking about playing a hand to cycle the deck while aiming for my five highest synergy cards, likely leading to a \"high card\" situation.\n**Calculating multipliers and card strategy**\n\nI’m figuring out the multipliers involved with my cards. Two pair grants a +2 multiplier, and Supernova adds +1 based on the number of hands played. I realize the order of card effects matters, especially with even cards and the glass card’s x2 boost. I’m calculating a total multiplier around 102.9, leading to potential total chips around 146. \n\nGiven I need 35k, it makes sense to play a high-card hand now to gain 15k before aiming for two pair. I’ll select my five strongest cards while preserving options for the remaining hands.\n**Exploring flush and high card options**\n\nI’m considering how to create a flush with the 10♦, 9♦, and 4♦, but I realize I need two more diamonds. Or maybe aiming for a straight with 6-7-9-10-J, but that doesn’t work either. I could discard to chase two pair, but that feels uncertain. Given the moderate threshold, it seems fine to play now and save my discards for later. So, I’ll play cards 2, 8, 4, 5, and 6 for a high card, estimating around 15k chips and crafting a JSON action for it!\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,8,4,5,6]"}
