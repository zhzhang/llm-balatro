{"reasoning":"**Analyzing planet options**\n\nI'm looking at the different planet options: Pluto with high card, Mercury with a pair, and Mars with four of a kind. None of these directly improve my full house. However, using any of these planets gives me a Constellation bonus each time. I realize it's important to choose which planet provides the best backup if a full house isn't possible. A stronger pair might be helpful, and I have a lot of rank duplicates that could lead to four of a kind, but I'm not focusing on that. I think a pair planet could ultimately help my early hands.\n**Evaluating planet benefits**\n\nI'm weighing the benefits of different planets for my gameplay. Mercury gives a +1 multiplier and +15 chips for a pair, while Pluto offers +1 multiplier and +10 chips for a high card. Mars provides a hefty +3 multiplier and +30 chips for a four of a kind, which sounds great if I can pull it off sometimes, but it feels rare. My base is 60/7, so moving to 90/10 could strengthen my game. As antes rise, more chips become essential, so enhancing my base multiplier will help too.\n**Deciding on the best planet**\n\nI believe Mars is the best choice for maximizing my potential because it has the highest ceiling. If I manage to hit a four-of-a-kind, the rewards would be significant. Plus, all planets scale Constellation bonuses equally, so I want to choose the one that offers the highest benefits. Mars provides the best stats with +30 chips and a +3 multiplier. I’m going with Mars and will execute the action to select it!\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
