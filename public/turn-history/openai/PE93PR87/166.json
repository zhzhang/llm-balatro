{"reasoning":"**Considering tarot creation**\n\nI’m thinking about creating tarots now, but we’re currently in the middle of a blind. Tarots go into consumable slots, and ideally, I'd want them before the shop. However, winning the blind allows us to go to the shop, where consumables carry over. So, yes, creating tarots now could be beneficial, provided we have the room for two. If we discard both tarot-generators at once, we could possibly create two tarots with one discard action. But should I? Discarding high-value cards might hurt us in the immediate win. Still, we have three hands left and can play pairs or three-of-a-kinds. What if discarding draws new cards that are better? Ultimately, the goal is to ensure we beat the blind. With Pareidolia, Scary Face, and Splash, any strong five-card play should score high. Previous attempts showed a score of 17,577 with high-value cards.\n**Analyzing winning strategy**\n\nI’m figuring out that even a low score could be greater than 4,318, which means we can still win with a small value. I could discard both tarot aces, draw two cards, and play minimally to ensure a win while keeping one hand. However, the hands remaining yield a dollar each at the end of the round, so I want to win with as many hands left as possible. Since we currently have three hands left, winning one would leave us with two. \n\nBut wait—playing a hand consumes one. Ultimately, we need to meet the chips threshold, which means I have to play at least one more hand. The goal could be to try and win with just one hand, leaving two hands unused for a total of two dollars. If I discard first, it won’t affect the hands count, and I could still aim for that win, keeping two hands aside.\n**Considering discarding and tarots**\n\nI’m thinking that discarding is a fine option, especially since it might create tarots to use in the shop. These tarots could be used right away to help enhance my deck, though I can't use them in a round immediately. Wait, actually, I can use consumables during the hand selection phase? But right now, I don’t have any.\n\nIf I discard and create tarots, I could use them to improve my score before playing, but carrying them to the shop might be better. Generally, I can't use them in the shop, but I can modify my deck for the upcoming boss. However, I could generate two random tarots by discarding those aces, and one might be useful right away. But there's also the risk of getting tarots I don’t want to waste—they can be sold for a dollar, though!\n**Planning card discard and scoring**\n\nI just realized that I can sell consumables, which is great because having them is better than not having them at all. My next move seems to be discarding cards 6 and 8, which generate tarots, plus maybe some low cards to help cycle through. However, I need to keep enough cards for a strong hand.\n\nWith A♠, A♣, and potentially 3♥ and 3♣, I could form a Full House. If I discard both A♣ and A♦, I’ll still have A♠ along with the pairs. Having two pairs would trigger Spare Trousers, likely boosting the score to be greater than 4,318. So, the plan is to discard positions 6 and 8 to create two tarots and draw replacements.\n**Deciding on discards and hand type**\n\nI'm planning on playing two pairs with A♠ and A♣ along with my 3s and the best kicker, possibly 7♠ or 6♥ from my hand. In Balatro, the hand type is based on the cards played. With Splash, all played cards count for scoring, so I need to make sure my five-card play includes a pair and the two pairs.\n\nI want to maximize my chips by including the bonus ace A♠, which has an extra 30 chips. Splash allows all cards to count, making it beneficial. The Ace of Diamonds offers a +4 multiplier if played, but I need to discard for tarots.\n\nIt might be better to keep the Ace of Diamonds for that multiplier rather than sacrificing it for more tarots, but I really want those tarots for the upcoming boss that has an ante of 7. So yes, I’ll generate them by discarding two tarot-generators and hope to fill my consumable slots. I need to make sure I can create tarots when I discard. Since I have two empty slots, I should be able to get both.\n\nMy final action will be to discard positions 6 and 8 since I can’t sacrifice too many cards that might reduce my chances of making two pairs. Here goes: I'll go with a discard action at those positions. Let's format that return as an Action JSON with the appropriate details. Discarding [6, 8] it is!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [6,8]"}
