{"reasoning":"**Assessing card strategy**\n\nActually, I calculated that the full house scored 368 points, which includes the base 40 plus additional cards. I need to hit 0 discards for the mystic bonus. Discarding twice and playing the full house will give me enough chips, but I must keep core cards intact while discarding. I can discard a Jack and a 9 or a 4 and a 9. The risk is that new cards might disrupt the full house, so I need to be careful!\n**Choosing discard strategy**\n\nAfter discarding, my hand refills to 8 cards, but I still want to go for the full house. I need to be cautious because discarding could remove necessary cards. I’ve decided to discard positions 1 and 7, which are the Jack and the 9, to keep my options safe. I could play the full house now, but the boss discards 2 random cards afterward, which might risk losing key cards. So, discarding now seems best to reach 0 discards!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,7]"}
