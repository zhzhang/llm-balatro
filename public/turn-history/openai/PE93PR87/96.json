{"reasoning":"**Deciding on discards**\n\nI’m thinking about discarding four cards each time, and it seems that once I do, I can replace them with new ones. This sounds good! But there's a potential risk since I need to discard four times, which involves positions 1, 3, 6, and 8 (A of hearts, J of hearts, 7 of clubs, and 8 of diamonds). I'll make sure not to accidentally discard anything important while doing this. Time to execute the discard!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,6,8]"}
