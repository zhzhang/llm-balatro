{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nAt the start of each round, I draw a new hand from the deck, and specific cards used go to the discard pile, which might be reshuffled later. For the boss, I still have the option to draw cards, but it’s not deterministic. I’m considering if using cards now decreases the chance of needing them during the boss fight. Winning quickly could mean I keep more hands for money. The best play seems to be either a full house or a straight, and the scores are close.\n**Maximizing hand value**\n\nI could choose a straight to preserve some cards, but opting for a full house maximizes my score. I have a Justice tarot that can double the score for a card, but maybe I should save it for the boss. Mystic requires zero discards, and I have one left. I wonder if I should use it on a non-essential card for a bigger score. Discarding 10♣ or J♦ could allow me to keep my full house intact while still drawing a new card.\n**Deciding on card actions**\n\nI can definitely play a full house with K K K Q Q by using K♠ K♥ K♣ Q♠ Q♦. To activate Mystic, I'll discard 10♣, allowing me to play the full house. However, discarding uses one of my discards, leaving me with zero. Mystic triggers for a +15 multiplier when there are zero discards remaining. So, I need to discard the card first, but I'm questioning if it’s optimal since keeping 10♣ might help with a straight. But I don’t need a straight right now.\n**Making discard decisions**\n\nDiscarding the 10♣ could potentially draw something useful — maybe even another king for four of a kind, but I can't really rely on that. Discarding now might also create a chance for a tarot draw, but since the special Ace of Clubs isn't in my hand, that's not an option. Discarding 10♣ leaves me with 7 cards and allows me to have zero discards, enabling Mystic Summit. So, the next action is to discard the 10♣ to set up my strong full house of KKKQQ for a big score.\n**Preparing action command**\n\nI need to provide an action command in the correct JSON format, including fields like action, positions, intended_hand_type, and estimated_chips. For discarding, I’ll set action as \"discard\" with the position list. Since I only have one discard remaining, I should stick to just discarding the 10♣ (position 5). While I can discard up to 5, I want to keep my essential cards. So, I’ll proceed to finalize the output now.\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5]"}
