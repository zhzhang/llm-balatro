{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nIn this game, we like playing five cards; however, it's inconsistent when holding queens if drawn. I'd prefer to stick with the current build. We have a Justice consumable and wonder if we can use it in the shop. We need a target in hand, but there’s no hand displayed in the shop. So, we should focus on rearranging jokers and using round_select next. Rearranging now makes sense for future rounds, but we can always adjust later too.\n**Determining card order**\n\nI need to choose the order of my cards: Splash, Ice Cream, Spare Trousers, Supernova, Constellation, and Luchador. Since Spare Trousers and Supernova are additive multipliers, they should come before Constellation and Luchador, which are multiplicative. I’m thinking it might be better to place Splash first if it affects scoring. So, the final order should be: Splash, Ice Cream, Spare Trousers, Supernova, Constellation, and Luchador. I'll rearrange the jokers accordingly to reflect this new order.\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,6,2,3,4,5]"}
