{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategies**\n\nI need to evaluate which strategy works better for this boss round. We only need 22,000 points, and previous hands scored around 10-12k each. It looks like we'll need about two hands to reach our target. With the boss debuff affecting diamonds, our scoring may drop moderately, but I can aim for two pairs or a full house using non-diamonds. The Justice glass consumable could come in handy, but I'm concerned about the current state of my cards and enhancements.\n**Considering hand strategies**\n\nI’m thinking about how the boss effect might nullify the benefit of using the Ace of diamonds. I also have a Constellation multiplier of 1.6 and Spare Trousers for an additional +10 multiplier. The Supernova increases the number of times the hand has been played to boost the multiplier for different hand types. It seems that building around a full house might yield better scaling, but the Spare Trousers specifically favor two pairs. The boss debuff on diamonds could complicate forming a full house but doesn't necessarily eliminate the option.\n**Evaluating card strategy with debuffs**\n\nI'm considering how debuffed cards still count for hand formations, meaning I can use diamond cards to make pairs or three of a kind, even though they won't score chips or enhancements. With Splash, every played card counts towards scoring, but debuffed cards don't contribute chips. So, while they won't trigger enhancements, they can still be played. If I disable the boss with luchador, I can maintain diamond scoring but lose the significant x1.5 multiplier from polychrome luchador. That’s a tricky trade-off!\n**Analyzing the multiplier strategy**\n\nI'm realizing that if I sell before the round, I lose the x1.5 multiplier. Keeping it means I retain the multiplier but face a diamond debuff for this round. I wonder which option yields a higher expected value. I could try to avoid playing diamonds by discarding them, but there are 13 diamonds in the deck, and I might draw some. Discards are limited, so maybe I can handle it with the grabber for an extra hand. With the right multipliers, I should comfortably reach the needed 22k chips!\n**Deciding on strategy for the round**\n\nI think it’s best to keep the luchador for its x1.5 multiplier and play hands without diamonds or accept the reduction. Without the boss effect, a normal hand can score between 10-12k, but with a diamond debuff, it might drop to 8-10k. We can adapt! I could also use Justice to glass a key non-diamond card, but I’m focusing on the order of jokers to maximize scoring. I’ll likely aim for a two pair hand to grow our spare trousers scaling and set my intended hand type accordingly.\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
