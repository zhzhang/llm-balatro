{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card options**\n\nI think selling first could be a smart move, but I want to check my options: maybe consider Luchador or Sly? Smiley seems weak. The certificate gives a random sealed card each round, which could be powerful. \n\nNow, examining the jokers: Mystic Summit is strong if I manage discards. Smiley Face doesn’t seem great. Luchador is powerful and can save me later. Constellation offers scaling with planet uses and could be useful. Sly Joker is great for chips with a pair.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI think keeping my cards is wise, especially since a three-of-a-kind could trigger from containing a pair, which is good. So, selling Smiley seems to be the best option right now. I’ll just need to ensure I’m ready to output that action correctly. It's all about making the right moves, and I feel confident that this choice will help me out in the game!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
