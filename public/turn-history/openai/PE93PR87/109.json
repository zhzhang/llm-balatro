{"reasoning":"**Considering game strategy**\n\nI'm thinking that skipping the small doesn't eliminate the shop, just reduces the number of shops. However, the money gained from skipping might offset that loss. Our build seems strong, scoring between 10k-12k in ante4 with various thresholds in ante5. \n\nI realize Ice Cream chips decay by -5 per hand, but if we skip small, we might save it from decay during a round. The Garbage Tag gives $1 for unused discards, implying a useful gain. This strategy could boost our funds significantly!\n**Analyzing shop strategy**\n\nRight now, the shop has \"shoot the moon\" for a cost of 5. With $10, I could buy it, but that might not be the best move. Instead, I think about playing the small blind where I start with $2, getting a reward of $3 to make $5, plus any leftover hands. If we win, that leads back to the shop for new items, which could allow me to buy \"shoot the moon.\" \n\nI’m considering how much I might have by the end of the round, likely around $?? with 5 hands due to Grabber.\n**Calculating potential outcomes**\n\nIf I win in one hand, I make $1 for each of the remaining 4 hands, which adds to a reward of $3. That totals to $7, plus the existing $2, giving me $9. There might be $1 from interest too, but that comes at the end of the round after adding rewards. So if I win one hand, my total could be $10 after considering interest. \n\nHowever, if I need more hands, that amount decreases. With our current setup, it's possible to win one hand, especially with a good draw like two pairs or a full house. The Splash mechanic allows scoring even with random cards too. Additionally, skipping the big blind could yield an uncommon joker from the shop, which would be a strong asset!\n**Weighing options for upgrades**\n\nSkipping the big blind means no shop access and forces a boss encounter, which is tricky since I can't skip the boss. However, playing the boss leads to a shop after that. If the shop offers a free uncommon joker, that's intriguing! But skipping the big means waiting for the upgrade until after the boss.\n\nI’m considering if we can manage the boss without shop upgrades. We might handle it, but skipping small could let us grab a garbage tag, followed by skipping big for the uncommon tag. That way, I'd have $8 and the joker after the boss. However, I’d miss two shops and rewards totaling $7. Still, avoiding Ice Cream decay and gaining the uncommon tag seems worth it!\n**Evaluating strategy for purchases**\n\nI’m trying to figure out if skipping the small blind is necessary to later access the free uncommon joker. I can play the small blind and decide to skip the big later, which gives me shop access now. With $2 to start, I could end up with around $10 after playing, allowing for purchases. Skipping small gives an additional $8 but no shop, and might limit scaling.\n\nI think our build is set up to handle this. The Constellation boost and planet creation might help increase scaling. Every card counts with Splash, so playing five cards generally seems optimal. \n\nPlaying small feels safer and gives access to purchases sooner. The tag for skipping small offers immediate cash, but the shop after playing small has value too. Ultimately, I think taking that $8 now is wise, since it can help with future purchases, even though I could skip small, take the cash, and buy after the boss. However, the need for purchases and scaling still weighs heavily.\n**Developing strategy choices**\n\nGetting that free uncommon joker could be a big advantage, but I think we can manage without it. My plan is to skip the small blind for $8 and then play the big blind to secure a shop before facing the boss. If I skip the big blind, no shop until after the boss, but that could limit scaling opportunities. \n\nSince boss debuffs diamond cards, it might affect me, especially if there are many diamonds in my deck. I definitely want a shop before the boss to potentially buy upgrades or jokers. The garbage tag for unused discards presents a solid opportunity for cash too. \n\nTaking the guaranteed $8 from skipping small seems like the best option, so I think I’ll skip that round and choose to proceed with the action!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
