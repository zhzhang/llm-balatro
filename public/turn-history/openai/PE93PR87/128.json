{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop with only $2, which isn't enough to buy anything meaningful. I need to decide if selling something makes sense or if I should keep the money for interest. Selling a joker or a consumable could be options, but with my current build focused on Two Pair and scaling, I'm not sure it's smart to sell Justice, which might be useful against a big boss. It seems I should just leave the shop for the next round.\n**Analyzing scoring mechanics**\n\nI’m thinking about the scoring categories and whether order matters. It sounds like Even Steven is on-scored, while Splash might modify that scoring rule but still operates independently. However, it seems Splash’s effect alters scoring because all played cards count. I realize that Constellation and Luchador function as independent multipliers, but I wonder about Spare Trousers, which gains a multiplier if the hand contains Two Pair. It looks like I need to clarify how order affects these independent multipliers in scoring.\n**Understanding multiplier application**\n\nI’m realizing there's an interplay between additive and multiplicative independence that follows a left-to-right order. If I have both +mult and x mult, it makes sense to apply the x mult after the + mult for better results. In Balatro, independent jokers can be either additive or multiplicative, and I've noted that I should arrange jokers: all +mult should come before x mult. This means Splash, Spare Trousers, Supernova, Even Steven, Constellation, and Luchador should be in that order. However, since Even Steven triggers an earlier category, its positioning among the independent ones isn't crucial.\n**Finalizing multiplier arrangement**\n\nFor independent multipliers, it's important to place the x multipliers at the end of my list, which currently includes Splash, Spare, Supernova, Constellation, Luchador, and Even Steven. There's a concern about Even Steven being in slot 6, but since it triggers during scoring left-to-right, it won't affect the independent category. Constellation and Luchador come before Even Steven, but that's fine because Even Steven isn't independent. The arrangement with additive jokers looks good, so I think I can leave it as is without needing to rearrange anything.\n**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nThe best action seems to be to select a round. I can't sell Wily since I need funds, and selling Justice only nets $1. I wonder if selling Supernova for $2 to buy a Standard pack is worth it; that'd give me $4. But Supernova adds multipliers based on hands played, which is valuable since I often play Two Pair and Full House. Selling it might not be smart. Rerolling for tarot options sounds tempting, though I'd lose Supernova and Justice. In the end, keeping Supernova seems best for my current build. I’ll finalize by choosing round_select.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
