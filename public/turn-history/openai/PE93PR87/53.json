{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card mechanics**\n\nI'm looking at the dynamics of a card game where a certificate gives me a random sealed card and I can create blue and red seals. Since I start with eight cards, adding one more at the beginning of a round could enhance my strategy, even if it's less valuable later.\n\nThere's a splash effect where every card played counts for scoring, and the unconditional +50 chips seem really beneficial. This contrasts with Sly, which is conditional but also often triggers. I wonder how best to integrate these elements!\n**Considering card strategies**\n\nI'm thinking about how extra enhanced cards could work for chip value and joker triggers, even if they're not in my hand. If there’s no Splash effect, then non-hand cards wouldn’t trigger. However, with Splash active, it looks like every played card influences scoring, which is exciting! This could help score additional bonuses while still achieving pairs or three-of-a-kinds. \n\nFor now, our deck lacks enhanced cards, but the Lusty Joker could offer multipliers. Though my deck isn't heart-heavy, I might skip it due to inconsistency.\n**Assessing booster strategies**\n\nI'm weighing the Arcana pack, which could provide tarots for immediate enhancements and duplicates, but it costs 6 and seems uncertain. Since I'm preparing for a boss battle, I'm focused on a stable build featuring a full house with high multipliers from Mystic Summit (+15), spare trousers (+2 scaling), Luchador (x1.5), and constellation (x1.2). \n\nWith a full house at level 3, the base multiplier is 8, yielding around 90 chips. If we assume additional chips from cards sum up to around 53, that sets the total at 193 chips! The joker should also help enhance multipliers further.\n**Calculating multipliers and strategies**\n\nI've calculated that my current multiplier is 27, combining the base of 8 with +15 and +4. Then, factoring in constellation (x1.2) and Luchador (x1.5), my total multiplier becomes 48.6, leading to about 9380 chips—likely sufficient for the boss.\n\nI’m considering replacing Sly with Splash, as Splash gives a steady +50 chips, while Sly only triggers conditionally. If the boss debuffs, having the flexibility to play various hands could be advantageous. However, I’ll need to sell a joker, probably Sly, to clear space for this upgrade.\n**Deciding on card actions**\n\nI need to buy Splash for 5, which means I’ll sell Sly for 1, netting a cost of 4 and leaving me with $5. Selling the Certificate is tempting since it helps generate seals, but I think I should keep it to enhance my chances in future rounds. Therefore, the best move is to sell Sly and then buy Splash.\n\nI’ll also need to consider the order of actions, as I can only perform one at a time. It makes sense to sell Sly first to free up a slot. So, I'll proceed with selling the joker (Sly) now!\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
