{"reasoning":"**Selecting a planet**\n\nI've already chosen Black Hole and upgraded all hands by 1, leaving me with four options: Jupiter, Mercury, Pluto, and Uranus. Since my build highlights Two Pair and Spare Trousers, I'm leaning toward Uranus, as it boosts Two Pair to level 6. This upgrade gives me a +1 multiplier and +20 chips, which is great. Plus, it helps scale Constellation, which is important. Jupiter might work for a flush, but I don't currently have one. So, I'll go with Uranus.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
