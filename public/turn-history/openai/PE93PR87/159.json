{"reasoning":"**Considering card strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about how Splash affects scoring. With Pareidolia + Scary Face, I'd want all cards to matter. If I don't use Splash, only the cards in hand type count. Playing a high card would waste potential if only one scores, but can I play five-card hands like a full house or two pair for more points? Two pair scores 4, and full house scores 5, but with Splash, the kicker also scores and gives extra chips. I’ll consider selling cards before buying.\n**Planning actions in-game**\n\nFirst things first, I need to sell the joker to create a slot. Selling it gives me $2, bringing my total to $7, which lets me buy Pareidolia for $5. If I'm limited to one action right now, selling the joker makes the most sense. Since Pareidolia is a joker card and not negative, I can't buy it if I'm at max. I should go ahead and sell the joker. \n\nHowever, I’m also considering whether to sell another card, like Supernova, since it adds a multiplier for the cards I play. If I keep two pair, Supernova boosts my score by +10, but Even Steven could lead to a +20 multiplier if I play all even cards. There's a lot to weigh here!\n**Evaluating hand strategies**\n\nWith Pareidolia and Scary Face, the synergy is really strong! I could focus on playing card hands that give the highest base multipliers and chips. A full house is appealing since it offers a high base of 140 chips and a multiplier of 12. But I wonder about consistency in getting full houses, especially since I can play with Splash, meaning all 5 cards score. While a two pair gives a base of 80 chips and a multiplier of 5, the full house is still significantly better. However, the current deck isn’t modified much. The high card option might be the easiest to play, especially since all cards are counted for scoring with Splash. The base multipliers vary: high card is 3, two pair is 5, and full house is 12. So many choices to consider!\n**Strategizing hand types**\n\nI want to focus on higher hand types while remembering I can play any 5 cards and still score all. Aiming for a full house seems wise since it provides more value. I should keep in mind that my Spare Trousers benefit from a two pair, which is currently growing. \n\nInterestingly, a full house contains two pairs, triggering the bonus for Trousers. So, I can pursue full houses without sacrificing my strategy. There's also the option to buy The Sun for potential flushes or straight flushes, but I need to consider my slot and funds.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI currently have $7 after selling Even Steven. I could buy Pareidolia for $5, leaving me with $2, but that means I can't buy The Sun. However, The Sun might be helpful in the long run. It's a tough choice, but I think Pareidolia has to be my priority right now. So, my first action will be to sell the joker for 2. I'll need to provide the JSON accordingly for that action.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
