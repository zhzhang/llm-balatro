{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI'm considering the Certificate for $6, which adds a random playing card with a seal at the start of each round. That seems strong early on, effectively increasing my hand size. The seals come in different types, and while the random card could be beneficial, it might add a trash card too. I also have $7 and can buy the Certificate, but the Arcana pack for $4 could provide immediate value as well. Balancing my options is tricky!\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI'm thinking the best move might be to buy the Arcana pack for $4, hoping for a good tarot card. I can choose one out of three, which could give me a solid boost like The Magician or The Empress. There's some risk since I won't have control over what I get immediately. I also need to consider keeping Luchador for extra multiplier benefits while saving for the upcoming boss fight and managing my jokers. Balancing all these factors feels a bit tricky!\n**Assessing purchase options**\n\nI can buy up to 6 jokers, and I currently have 4, which gives me some room. My main goal in the shop is to strengthen my deck and gather more economy. At $7, funds are limited. The Certificate seems stronger than small tarots, but at $6, it feels pricey. It likely counts as a joker since it's in the shop cards section. Essentially, it adds a random card with a seal to my hand each round, expanding my hand size to 9 temporarily, which could boost my strategy!\n**Clarifying Certificate functionality**\n\nI'm trying to clarify how the Certificate works. Initially, I thought it added to my deck permanently, but the description states: \"When the round begins, add a random playing card with a random seal to your hand.\" This means it creates an ephemeral card each round rather than permanently altering my deck, which seems beneficial. It could help avoid debuffs during boss encounters since it’s a new card that hasn’t been played before. However, it doesn't directly improve my chips or multipliers.\n**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI’m analyzing the scoring system which includes Smiley bonuses and others that favor face-heavy hands. With $7, I’m considering the Arcana pack for $4, leaving $3. The Hanged Man consumable, while useful for deck thinning, is also $3 but requires targeting cards in hand. It seems I can buy the Hanged Man for later use, but I'd need to be in the right round to target cards. The Arcana pack looks promising for immediate enhancements, so I might lean towards that instead.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI’m considering how to proceed with my purchases. Buying the Certificate joker seems like a solid choice since it offers consistent benefits and doesn’t require targeting cards. Alternatively, I could buy the Hanged Man tarot for deck thinning, but the Certificate’s sealed card each round could significantly boost my scoring and economy, especially if I generate planet cards. This strategy seems strong with Constellation scaling in mind. I think I’ll go ahead and buy the Certificate.\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
