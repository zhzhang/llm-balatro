{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategy**\n\nIf I skip, I miss out on reward money and the shop after the blind. I could skip small to stay in blind selection for a chance at bigger rewards. Skipping both would take me directly to the boss but with two tags, which means I can't skip the boss. My favorite deck's last full house had a power of 1620, but now I need to reach 2000 chips, which might take two hands; it's a bit uncertain.\n**Calculating chip strategy**\n\nI’m looking at my current chips: with 5 cards, I estimate around 105 chips, which could get me close to 2000 with some multipliers. A full house is my best bet, especially since three of a kind doesn’t fit with the modifications I have. I wonder about my risk in achieving a full house, given the deck composition. Skipping could give me a D6 tag for free rerolls, which seems great since I’m low on cash and need to make strategic purchases.\n**Exploring shop strategy**\n\nI see a plan forming! If I come across a base edition joker, I can reroll for free, but I need to ensure a shop is available. If I skip small blinds and focus on big ones, winning would lead me to a shop after each victory—except for the final blind. To reach 3000 chips, I might need two full houses. With a few hands and discards in play, hitting 1800 per hand seems doable.\n**Assessing boss and shop strategy**\n\nI think I can take on the boss at 4000 potential with three hands, but that comes with risk. Alternatively, I could play small to earn $3 and access the shop. The D6 tag also seems valuable! If I play small, I gain $3 and some interest on leftover hands, and I could get a joker without spending actual money due to the Negative tag. This could work out well, especially if there’s a base edition joker available. I must remember the joker limit!\n**Planning strategy for jokers and tags**\n\nI realized that negative editions add a +1 joker slot without occupying space, which is an advantage! So I should focus on tagging a good joker. If I play small, the shop may have random jokers, but without the D6, rerolls are costly. Skipping small allows me to combine the D6 with the Negative tag for free rerolls, helping me search for a valuable base joker. The trade-off is missing $3 and a shop, but I'm leaning towards skipping small to set up for a strong joker. Playing big after that could maximize my rewards and options.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
