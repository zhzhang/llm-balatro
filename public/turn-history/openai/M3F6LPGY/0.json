{"reasoning":"**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nIn the game, I'm wondering about the impact of skipping the small blind. If I do skip, it might trigger a tag at the next shop, but that could mean losing $3 and the chance to shop early. Doubling my money could yield an extra $4, plus I still get to play the big blind for $4, allowing access to the shop after winning. I think the economy tag is valuable, so maybe skipping for it is worth it. I'll decide to skip the round.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
