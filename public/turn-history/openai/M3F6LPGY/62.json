{"reasoning":"**Deciding shop actions**\n\nI need to make decisions about my shopping options with just $0. I can't buy anything right now. I could sell Zany for $1, but that's not a great choice. A Credit Card costs $1, which is also unaffordable, and I can't reroll. It seems best to use round_select. I wonder if selling the joker could help me afford the Credit Card, but Zany is valuable. I guess we should hold off for now and go to the next blind to earn money.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
