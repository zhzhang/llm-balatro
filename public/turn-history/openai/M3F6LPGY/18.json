{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy for boss fight**\n\nI’m considering going into the boss fight with $0 and no new cards, but I think we might still be able to beat 1600 points. The boss effect debuffs any card played earlier in the same ante, so if I skip both small and big cards, nothing gets debuffed. That's a strategic advantage. However, skipping big means we enter the fight without extra money or shop cards, but I estimate we could still win with the right draws.\n**Weighing card strategy for boss fight**\n\nIf I play big and then face the boss, the boss debuffs previously used cards, which could be pretty punishing since reused cards would score nothing and lose their abilities. This could make reaching 1600 points tough. I could potentially mitigate this by using cards during the big phase that I don’t plan to reuse against the boss, though that's tricky. Alternatively, skipping the big play avoids debuffs and allows shopping afterward, but I’d lose some rewards. Still, the boss gives $5, and that could help with future shop buys.\n**Optimizing strategy for boss encounter**\n\nI'm considering skipping the small for a negative tag and the big for a voucher tag to avoid the boss debuff. This way, I can play the boss cleanly and aim to clear 1600 points, which seems plausible. However, skipping both means we won’t shop before facing the boss, which feels risky but manageable. Our deck and jokers are decent. I aim for a straight with a face card for extra points, but I’ll need to evaluate our chances carefully. We have four hands and three discards to try and hit our targets.\n**Assessing straight-making strategy**\n\nI'm pondering whether we can reliably complete straights. We’ve leveled the straight to level 2, which is a solid base, and we’ve managed multiple straights before. Including a face card can boost our score significantly. However, a five-card straight like A2345 might not have a face, so that’s something to consider. If I play big and then face the boss with the debuff, that could be riskier since it complicates scoring. Skipping big means $0 at the start, but potentially earning $5 from the boss afterward could balance things out. A negative joker might give us a quicker advantage too!\n**Deciding on round strategy**\n\nI’m wondering if skipping both blinds might be too greedy. The small blind rewards us with $800 and the big with $1200, which together could yield $6-10 in end-of-round money, plus any remaining hands and interest, and that’s pretty significant. However, the negative tag could give us a free joker and effectively act as a permanent upgrade. Skipping both means missing out on two shops and the chance to buy jokers early, but we could have more money after the boss fight. Given all this, I'll choose to proceed by skipping the small blind for now.\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
