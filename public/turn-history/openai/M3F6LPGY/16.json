{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop purchases**\n\nWe're at ante 2 with $10. I have Zany and Photograph jokers to consider. The shop has a couple of interesting options, like the Mega Standard pack for $8 or the Arcana for $4. The Clearance Sale offers a strong long-term benefit, but it spends all my money right now. The To Do List could work well with Zany since it requires a Three of a Kind for synergy. I'm weighing the potential benefits of each option carefully.\n**Evaluating purchase options**\n\nI'm looking at the available options, and it feels a bit random, not as efficient as I hoped. The Mega Standard pack gives me 2 new cards, which could help with the Photograph, but it's $8, which feels steep. The Mars planet offers a Four of a Kind upgrade, but that doesn’t fit my current build well. I might want to consider the Clearance Sale, as using all $10 now would provide a 25% discount for future purchases, especially since I have about 16 shops left.\n**Weighing purchase options**\n\nI’m considering our immediate needs for upcoming blinds and the strengths of our current jokers. We’ve scored well in the past, so we should be okay. The reroll cost of $5 feels too high, so I think the best option is to buy the Clearance Sale voucher, which will leave me with no money but a chance to earn more later. Alternatively, I could also buy the To Do List and Arcana pack for $4 each, which could lead to more earnings over time, while also supporting synergy with Zany.\n**Choosing the voucher option**\n\nThe voucher offers a 25% discount, which is significant—saving about $2.50 on average purchases of $10 at each shop. That really adds up over time, so it seems like the best choice. Purchasing the voucher wouldn’t stop me from buying cards later if I had the funds, but right now, I’d have nothing left. I may want the To Do List too, though it could reappear. Still, I’ll go ahead and buy the voucher now.\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
