{"reasoning":"**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI need to figure out whether to buy DNA for $6 when I only have $3. I could sell jokers: Zany for $1, Greedy for $2, and Sly for $1, which would total $4. Selling all would net me $7, but I would lose scoring jokers. However, DNA is powerful in the long run. Selling just Greedy and Sly gives me $3, reaching the $6 needed to get DNA, while keeping Zany for potential scoring. Buying DNA seems like a smart move!\n**Considering card purchases**\n\nI’m weighing my options: I could buy Justice for $2 to create a high-value glass card for the boss, but that might be more useful later. Justice in the shop seems consumable, and I can buy it alongside my current cards. If I sell all my jokers, I'll have enough to buy DNA for $6, but then I can't get Justice. However, if I sell everything, I could get Justice but miss the chance for DNA. I wonder if a celestial pack for $3 might be a better option instead.\n**Deciding on actions**\n\nI need to decide what’s best for my strategy. DNA is crucial for building my deck, but I need to defeat the boss immediately. Keeping Zany is a good idea since it’ll help trigger full houses and straights. Without Drunkard, my deck’s consistency has suffered. I’ll likely sell Greedy or Sly. Selling Greedy first makes sense since it has a bigger value. After that, I’ll sell Sly and then buy DNA, so I’ll plan to execute those actions sequentially. Let's sell Greedy first for $2.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
