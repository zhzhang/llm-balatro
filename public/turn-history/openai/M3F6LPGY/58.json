{"reasoning":"**Calculating poker hand values**\n\nI’m realizing if we add two fives, we could create a full house with the cards I have. I’ve got 5S and 5D, which, when played with three 7s, gives me a full house. The total for chip value comes out to 1728 when I multiply the base by the bonus for having trips. However, I might be better off opting for a simpler three of a kind with just the three 7s, saving other cards for later. Playing will remove used cards and fill my hand size afterward.\n**Deciding on card play**\n\nIf I play only three cards, I can keep five in hand, but since we're likely finishing the blind, I don't need to do that. I should aim for the minimal necessary to form the correct hand type, so I’ll play three 7s from positions 2, 5, and 7, which will give me three of a kind. The Zany trigger activates because I have that three of a kind. I estimate chips at about 765. I need to ensure that my three-card play counts correctly. Let’s go ahead and play 2, 5, and 7 and return that in JSON format.\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,5,7]"}
