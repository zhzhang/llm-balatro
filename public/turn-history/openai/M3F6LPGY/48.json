{"reasoning":"**Deciding purchase options**\n\nI'm in a shop with $6, where I can buy DNA for that amount. If I do, I won't have any money left. Alternatively, I could get Justice (2) plus celestial packs, but it sounds impossible right now. To beat the boss, DNA could be helpful in the long run, but I'm not certain of that. With my current scoring options, I might need a higher chip threshold to defeat the boss. I have some calculations to consider for scoring too!\n**Calculating scoring and purchase decisions**\n\nI’m working through some scores. I've calculated that if I do 65 plus about 35, it reaches 100. If I then multiply by 6, it totals 1800, which isn’t huge. Earlier, I scored more with Zany, Sly, and Greedy. Skipping DNA might make sense to buy celestial packs to improve my hands for the boss. I could use my $6 to get two celestial packs for $3 each, which is a better strategy overall. But those packs are random—they could also be useless!\n**Weighing options for boss battle**\n\nI'm considering if I can still get something beneficial. DNA is helpful long term, but there's a risk of losing to the boss. If I manage to beat the boss, I might unlock a new shop for DNA later, but that's rare. It's about survival priority. Can I defeat the boss with just Zany? The ante might require 3000, needing two full houses. Buying a celestial pack could boost my scoring, and I can get Justice and one celestial pack, leaving me with one. This gives me a glass card option for later!\n**Considering DNA use and strategy**\n\nI’m thinking about how DNA only uses one card on the first hand of the round, and that could be a waste against the boss. I could use it earlier on small/big blinds, but it seems less useful now. Buying DNA could create copies of strong cards later, but I worry it won’t scale without other support. While I might survive this ante with my current deck, spending all my money on DNA could limit my chance to get planet boosters right now.\n**Deciding on purchases in the shop**\n\nI’m considering whether I should buy one celestial pack to boost my scoring and save money for DNA, but I realize my funds are fixed. If I buy the booster pack first, I hope to get a planet for a full house or straight. Selling Zany might be necessary to afford DNA later on, but I can’t get enough right now. If I focus on beating the boss, I should get the packs. I think survival is key! I’ll buy one celestial pack first, and then we can choose the planet.\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
