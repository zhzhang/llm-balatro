{"reasoning":"**Analyzing shop strategy**\n\nI’m at the shop after a big blind ante round. I have $5, with jokers like Zany and Drunkard being negative; I can have a maximum of 6 jokers. The available shop cards include Judgement for $2 and two Celestial packs for $3 each, already discounted. I’m calculating whether to reroll, noting that the reroll cost may be $0 only if a D6 tag applied correctly. Now, should I buy Judgement first or reroll? Judgement creates a random joker, which could be beneficial, but I might lose it if I reroll.\n**Clarifying Judgement mechanics**\n\nI realized that Judgement is a tarot consumable in the shop, which creates a random Joker card. When used, it adds the Joker to the slots if there's room available. I need a consumable slot for Judgement unless I buy and use it. If I purchase Judgement for $2, it takes up a slot, but I can activate it immediately. There's also a buy-and-use command specifically for consumables. Since Judgement doesn’t require a target, I think I can buy and use it to create a random Joker, which seems like a great move given my available slots!\n**Weighing options for Judgement**\n\nI’m thinking about the risk of getting a weak Joker from Judgement, but even so, I could sell it for some value. The cost of tarot is $2, and while I’d get a random Joker, I really only have Zany, which scores. So, using buy-and-use for Judgement seems strong compared to rerolling, especially since rerolling is free. However, I should consider rerolling first to see if I can find a better Joker while still having $3 left for either a celestial pack or another reroll.\n**Deciding on card purchases**\n\nI’m considering which planets can help me—like Saturn for straight hands, Earth for full houses, and Jupiter for flushes. However, it's probably better to focus on getting more Jokers first. With $5, I could buy one pack for $3 and Judgement for $2, but if Judgement gives me a useful Joker, that might work out. I think I should prioritize buying Judgement first for a new Joker. So, I’ll go ahead and execute buy_and_use_consumable for position 1 to get that random Joker.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
