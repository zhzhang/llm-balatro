{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game strategies**\n\nI see that a Jumbo standard adds a playing card to the deck for $4. There are also vouchers: a Paint Brush that increases hand size for $7 and a Magic Trick that lets us buy playing cards for $7. Since we already have a 25% off voucher, I'm wondering if the prices reflect that discount.\n\nThe Negative Tag means the next base edition Joker is free when it appears, which could be helpful! With $8, I could buy the Paint Brush for $7, leading to a better hand size. But that'll leave just $1, which makes me question if it's the best choice.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm considering whether to prioritize our spending after the boss round since we're about to play. If I buy the Paint Brush for $7, that increases my hand size, which seems beneficial right now. Alternatively, there's Earth and Jumbo Celestial for $6, which leaves $2 for future needs.\n\nHowever, the Paint Brush seems like a solid long-term investment, especially with our current setup. I could buy Earth now and hope to get hand size later, but the voucher might not come around again. Rerolling the shop for a joker is an option too, but there appears to be no base edition joker available.\n**Analyzing shop options**\n\nIt looks like the shop cards only show planet cards, which makes me think consumables might also be included. If there are no jokers available, I might not see them here. Since we have a tag that lets us get the next base edition Joker for free, rerolling could be worthwhile, but that costs $5 and leaves us with $3.\n\nWe could also buy a booster that might contain a joker, but the Standard pack only adds playing cards, not jokers. There's also the option to buy the Magic Trick using our Clearance Sale voucher, but it feels quite pricey, especially since we already have the Standard pack available.\n**Planning for upcoming ante**\n\nAs I prepare for the upcoming ante difficulty, I see that the chips needed per blind will increase, which means I need better scaling strategies. Leveling up Full House with Earth gives me a base of 65 chips and a multiplier of 6, which is pretty significant!\n\nWith Zany adding 12 to my multiplier, I could reach 36. Buying the Paint Brush for +1 hand size doesn't directly improve scores, but it helps create better hand types. I still think we can make a full house with size 8 often, but going to size 9 really boosts our chances. Investing in Earth seems crucial, and I wonder if a celestial pack might offer planets like Earth or Saturn for more upgrades.\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI can buy Earth and perhaps the celestial pack for additional planets within my budget, leaving me $2 for future shops. However, there's a chance that I could reroll for a free joker, but I can’t do that with just $2 left.\n\nI think the best option is to buy Earth for $2 and then consider getting a celestial pack, which would enhance my core hand types. However, I also see the value in the Paint Brush, which could increase my scoring consistency. Maybe I’ll have to balance these options against the potential repeat appearance of the voucher. Selling items like Photograph or Zany could provide extra funds, but I’m hesitant to lose their potential multipliers. Overall, while buying Earth is tempting, holding off on it might lead to better long-term gains.\n**Assessing survival and purchases**\n\nI need to consider the immediate survival expectation for Ante 3, where the chips required might scale up to around 4000. Upgrading with Earth can significantly enhance my base score, while the Paint Brush helps increase my hand variety. A typical full house scores around 1620; I estimate for Ante 3 bosses it might need to reach about 3200.\n\nI believe buying Earth now would set me up well for the future. I could potentially sell Photograph for $2 to buy both Earth and the Paint Brush, but I hesitate to lose its multiplier benefit. Ultimately, I think securing Earth while considering the Jumbo Celestial pack would improve my overall performance without sacrificing too much. Thus, I’ll go for Earth first!\n**Deciding on purchases**\n\nI'm considering purchasing the Paint Brush voucher first to secure its benefits, since we may not have enough money later. With $8 to start and purchasing the Paint Brush for $7, I’d be left with only $1, which doesn’t allow for buying Earth right now. However, Earth might not appear later in shops.\n\nI believe the Paint Brush will help with hand sizes and increase the likelihood of creating winning hands. I can sell the Photograph for $2, then buy Earth, keeping Zany. I think I’ll opt to buy the Paint Brush now, as it’s a strong long-term investment for my scoring potential!\n**Finalizing voucher purchase**\n\nI’ll have $1 left after buying the Paint Brush voucher, which is the best option right now. This ensures I can improve my hand sizes effectively. There’s also the Magic Trick voucher, but it’s not as valuable at the moment. \n\nI’ll proceed with the action to \"buy_voucher\" at position [1]. The cost is $7, and since I have $8, I can definitely afford it. Let’s go ahead and make that purchase!\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
