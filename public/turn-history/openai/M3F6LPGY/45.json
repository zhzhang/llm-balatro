{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop actions**\n\nI'm struggling to select a card in the shop because the buy_and_use function doesn’t seem to allow that. Although Justice requires a target and it’s not consumable, I could buy it and use it later in a round when I have a hand. It’s listed in the shop at $2, but having $0 means selling is necessary. Still, that doesn't feel rewarding. Perhaps ending the shop phase and conserving jokers makes sense, especially with DNA on offer that could shape the run.\n**Restructuring for DNA purchase**\n\nI'm deciding how to buy DNA while ensuring I have enough resources to beat the boss. To get $6, I need to sell at least that much. I could sell combinations like Drunkard, Greedy, and Sly or Drunkard, Greedy, and Zany. Then, I need to consider which card to keep. Zany has a multiplier that activates with three of a kind, while Sly triggers with pairs. Both can occur on a full house or four of a kind, but I wonder which multiplier boosts my chips more effectively.\n**Evaluating card choices for DNA**\n\nI'm calculating potential multipliers with my cards to decide whether to buy DNA. If I keep Zany, I can get a multiplier of +12 on a full house, so my total could reach 2,970 chips. If I just keep Sly, I’d only reach 990 chips. Zany seems more powerful for that scenario, but what if I can't make a full house? In straights, neither card helps. Since full houses yield the best score, keeping Zany seems like the wiser option. But both cards sell for 1, so the choice is tricky!\n**Considering DNA use versus card selling**\n\nI’m thinking about using DNA first, but that means playing a high card that won’t take advantage of Zany. Zany helps my later hands, but selling Drunkard could hurt since it provides extra discards to find full houses or straights. Drunkard adds one discard per round, which is useful. Although DNA seems more valuable long-term, losing those discards might make defeating the boss tricky. Yet, with typical rounds allowing three discards, I could manage without Drunkard. Alternatively, selling Greedy, Sly, and Zany for three more isn’t enough, either.\n**Strategizing card sales**\n\nI’m planning to sell Drunkard first to get $3 and then move on to Greedy for $5, followed by Sly to hit $6, and finally buy DNA. I think it’s safe after selling, even if shop positions change. I’ve considered keeping Sly instead of Zany, but I’ve decided to sell Sly. My first action will be to sell Drunkard to raise some funds. It seems I can only sell them one at a time, so I’ll proceed with that action now.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
