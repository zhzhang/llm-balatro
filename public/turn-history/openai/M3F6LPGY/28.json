{"reasoning":"**Deciding on shop actions**\n\nI need to figure out my next move. We sold a Photograph and now have $3, enough to buy Earth for $2, which levels up my Full House. That seems like a solid choice! Jupiter could be good too, but since I'm prioritizing the Full House, I think Earth is the better option. The question is: if I buy Earth, will it go into my consumables? The command list mentions buying and using consumables, which might fit the bill perfectly without needing extra storage. So, I’ll go with buying and using Earth directly.\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
