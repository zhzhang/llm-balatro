{"reasoning":"**Evaluating game options**\n\nI need to figure out whether to play or skip the small blind since I'm broke. Skipping gives me a Rare Tag for a free joker, which is tempting because my only joker is Zany. However, if I skip the small blind, I won't get to shop after that blind. The tag should apply to the next shop after I beat the blind. But skipping means I lose the $3 reward and potential end-of-round dollars. It’s a tough choice!\n**Assessing game strategy**\n\nI think skipping the big blind might actually be a good idea so I can gain both tags. However, if I skip both blinds, I’ll face the boss with 10k chips but no chance to shop, just one joker, and no dollars. It feels risky. Still, our hand levels might be decent. I recall previously scoring around 2k with a full house. The new threshold is 10k, which is much higher, but I can leverage my hand levels. A four of a kind could yield a solid chip multiplier!\n**Calculating potential earnings**\n\nFor a four of a kind, I think it adds the value of the four cards with their rank, plus the kicker, but the kicker doesn’t contribute since it’s not part of the main hand. The scoring includes five cards, but only the four count for chips. So, that could total 4000 chips. However, since I need 10k across hands and each hand might yield around 4k, I could plausibly manage with two hands. Still, I should avoid skipping both blinds. Playing the small blind could help me earn at least $3!\n**Deciding on buying or skipping**\n\nI’m considering the options for buying things like a credit card or tarot deck, which might cost around $1, but the free rare joker from the rarity tag seems much more valuable than just $3. If I skip the small blind, I won’t get a chance to boost my money until the big blind or boss. Winning the big could give me $4. Skipping small seems best, even if playing it gives me $3, since that free rare joker might help later on!\n**Weighing options on skipping**\n\nI'm considering if I should skip the big blind for the coupon tag, which could make initial cards and boosters free in the next shop, but that means I'd face the boss with only Zany and no chance to shop. The boss effect decreases my hand level, which could hurt my score. It seems better to use the tag from the small blind and shop after the big blind to get a free rare joker. Skipping small for that free rare seems the safest way. So, I’m leaning towards skipping the small blind to improve my chances against the boss!\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
