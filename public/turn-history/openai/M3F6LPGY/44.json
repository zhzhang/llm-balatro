{"reasoning":"**Evaluating reroll options**\n\nI’m considering whether I should stick with Sly or reroll for a better option. I can spend $1 to reroll and potentially buy something new if it’s $1; some jokers can sell for $2 or $1. But if I reroll and have $0 left, I can’t buy anything unless I sell a joker first. I think rerolling now might help me to see new offerings and might allow for a purchase with a good deal!\n**Deciding on reroll strategy**\n\nI think I should reroll once for $1 to see what I can find. If there aren’t any good items, I can just keep my current jokers and end it. There's not much reason to hold onto cash unless I can end up with $5 or more, which doesn’t seem likely. I'll check my jokers' order before the reroll, but it looks like I’ll just go ahead and reroll now!\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
