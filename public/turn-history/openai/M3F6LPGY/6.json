I wonder if I can construct a scoring hand with a new draw\\u2014maybe a straight or a flush? However, it seems like I might need to play a stronger hand to lower the point requirement. If I play a five-card hand including spades, other combinations might not yield a straight. Ultimately, a flush seems to be the best path.\\n**Exploring card game options**\\n\\nI'm considering whether I can play fewer than 5 spades to make a pair of kings. Unfortunately, since I only have the king of spades, that's not possible. So, it looks like a flush is the way to go. I wonder if I should discard two off-suit cards to go for a straight flush. I already have 10-9-3-Q-K in spades! I could discard three spades, but that risks losing my flush. Even so, a flush of 308 is still solid!\\n**Calculating winning hands**\\n\\nTo win in one hand, I need around 450 points, but what kind of hand could achieve that without jokers? I estimate that a straight flush could get me to 1200 points, while four of a kind could reach around 700. However, a full house wouldn't be enough, and a regular flush seems impossible. So, it looks like the best approach is to play a flush now and then aim for another flush or three of a kind later. I'm aware that hearts might be the boss next round, but I want to play strategically for an advantage!\\n**Planning next moves**\\n\\nAfter playing, I\\u2019ll have three hands left and currently 308 chips. So, I need to think about my next steps. I\\u2019m focusing on a flush as my intended hand type, keeping in mind that I need to manage my chips wisely. I\\u2019ll consider the play positions 1-5 for strategic action. It\\u2019s essential to plan carefully to maximize my chances in the game. Time to decide on the best approach!\\n\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 5 flush 308\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 5]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $8\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Big.\\nChips Needed: 450\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 4 of Spades.

If I have a pair of sixes, I could use that plus any other pair, but I don't have three of a kind. I wonder if I can form a straight with 4, 6, 7, and 8 but I\\u2019m missing the 5 or 9, so no straight there. I can't get a flush either. My high card is Ace, and I need to create stronger hands, like a flush or straight, using discards. Given three hands and a target of 142, I could do 50 chips each or two hands of 71 chips. A straight contributes more chips with a solid base, while a flush might yield even higher.\\n**Prioritizing hand improvement**\\n\\nI\\u2019m focusing on finishing with a flush or straight, so I need to prioritize my discards to achieve that. My current hand has the potential for a straight with 4, 6, 7, and 8, but I need a 5 and 9, or maybe a 5 and 3. Oh wait, a straight must be consecutive! With what I have, I\\u2019m close to 4-5-6-7-8 if I draw a 5. I also have two 6's, which helps.\\n\\nAdditionally, I could aim for a diamond flush with Ad, Kd, and 8d, needing two more diamonds, and there are good odds with 9 diamonds left. There\\u2019s also a heart flush option with Qh, 7h, and 6h, needing two hearts. I\\u2019ll have to decide which is the better option!\\n**Calculating discard strategies**\\n\\nIf I keep 3 diamonds and discard 5, I can draw 5 new cards. I want to calculate the probability of getting at least 2 diamonds from those 5 draws among 35 cards with 9 diamonds. Using hypergeometric distribution, I compute that: the chances of getting 0 diamonds is about 20% and for 1 diamond around 41%. So, the probability of getting at least 2 diamonds ends up being approximately 38%.\\n\\nIf I keep 3 hearts and discard 5, the chances remain similar, while keeping 3 spades with 7 available is worse. I wonder if it\\u2019s better to discard fewer cards instead. With 3 discards left, maybe I should aim for a straight by discarding A, K, and Q, trying to find 5, 9, and 10, as flush probability with one discard is low.\\n**Exploring hand options**\\n\\nSo, I\\u2019m considering keeping my pair of 6s to try for three of a kind. There are only 2 sixes left in the deck with 35 cards, and I can't discard more than 5. However, I can still play my pair and have two hands left, which is good, but I'd like to finish quickly.\\n\\nThe simplest option might be to aim for a straight with 4-5-6-7-8. I just need to draw a 5. There are only 3 fives left, which isn\\u2019t great. \\n\\nAlternatively, I could aim for a straight of 6-7-8-9-10. I already have 6, 7, and 8, but I need both 9 and 10, and there are 3 nines and 3 tens in the deck. It might be better to calculate the probability of drawing both from those 5 cards.\\n**Planning for optimal play**\\n\\nI'm considering my hand strategy now. I could keep 6, 7, and 8, but I need at least one 9 and one 10 from my next draws. For that, I'll discard to increase my chances. Using the inclusion-exclusion method, my calculated probability of getting both a 9 and a 10 from 5 draws is only about 12%, which isn't great!\\n\\nOne option is to make a flush. However, since I only have 3 hearts, I can\\u2019t reach this goal without discarding too many. My best bet may be to aim for two pair or three-of-a-kind by discarding high cards while retaining what helps form a straight. I want to discard high non-connectors, keeping pairs, and try to draw new cards. I'll discard cards that don't contribute to a straight and focus on drawing toward potential straights or three-of-a-kinds. Using my 3 discards strategically could improve my chances for a solid hand!\\n**Calculating draw strategy**\\n\\nI need to decide how to discard cards while maximizing my chances for a straight or another strong hand. With my current cards\\u2014keeping 4, 6, 7, and 8\\u2014I will discard the A, K, Q, and the extra 6 to draw 4 new cards. The probability of drawing at least one 5 from the remaining deck is about 31.3%. It's crucial to ensure I keep at least one 6 for a straight, as there are still a couple of sixes left. After the discard, I can evaluate what to play based on the new cards I draw.\\n\\nCommand: discard 2 5 6 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 6]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $8\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Big.\\nChips Needed: 450\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 4 of Spades.

With 3 hands left and 2 discards, my current hand has some potential for a straight, but I lack the necessary cards. I could also aim for a diamond flush since I have four diamonds. The deck has a limited number of cards left, so I need to calculate probabilities for drawing the cards I need.\\n**Calculating discard strategy**\\n\\nLet\\u2019s approximate: if I calculate the probabilities, I find that if I discard 4 cards, I have about a 60% chance of drawing at least one diamond. If I only discard 3 cards, that drops to around 49%. Given I have 2 discards left, it makes sense to discard 4. If I succeed with the flush, I'll earn a base of 35 chips, plus additional chips from the cards involved. Even with lower estimates, the flush would likely give me enough chips to exceed my target.\\n**Deciding on a strategy**\\n\\nI'm considering alternatives for my approach. Playing a pair or a high card could work for two hands, but the diamond flush seems like the best bet to win a single hand. I have three hands left, and I can use a discard to improve my odds. While I could play a strong hand now, I'm not confident in my current cards. Discarding to attempt a diamond flush seems like the best option. I need to focus on the right cards to discard to maximize my chances.\\n**Evaluating card strategy**\\n\\nI\\u2019m weighing my options here. Keeping the King of Clubs might help with a potential straight (9-10-J-Q-K), but that would mean discarding fewer cards and decreasing my chance of drawing diamonds. However, I could try for both a straight and a flush. The flush seems easier, though! I'll discard my first four cards. If I draw a diamond, I\\u2019ll focus on the flush; if not, I can still adapt and play a different hand. So, I\\u2019ll definitely go ahead with this plan!\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $8\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Big.\\nChips Needed: 450\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 2 of Spades.

  "reasoning": "**Calculating chip strategy**\n\nI need to reach 450 chips and I'm currently at 308, so I need 142 more. My hand has 4 diamonds, specifically Q, J, 10, and 8, plus some off-suit cards. With one discard left and three hands, I can likely win without too much risk. I want to attempt a diamond flush by discarding the 3 off-suit cards and possibly one diamond. The probability of drawing at least one diamond from the remaining deck is about 66%, which looks promising! If I miss, I can still play pairs for the remaining chips.\n**Calculating flush potential**\n\nIf I manage to achieve a flush, I could score enough with just one hand. The base score for a flush is 35 chips, and then I’d add the chip values of the cards in my hand, like Q, J, 10, and 8, totaling about 48 plus any extra card. My previous flush yielded 308 chips, giving me a formula: for a flush, the total chips would be 35 plus the ranks of the cards. Accumulating chips across hands within a round helps, but I still need to reach 450 total.\n**Exploring chip strategies**\n\nI actually only need 142 more chips, not 450 in one hand. If I play a flush that scores around 292 plus four times something, that would definitely exceed my goal. However, I could also consider a straight. If I had an 8, 9, 10, J, Q, I could play those cards regardless of suits, as the straight only cares about the ranks. The straight base score is 30 chips, and combining the cards gives me a total of 308 chips—enough to win!\n**Deciding on straight vs. flush**\n\nIt’s clear that playing a straight guarantees a win without risking a discard. I have three hands available, and the straight scores 308 chips, which is sufficient. The straight uses a base of 30 plus a multiplier of 4, summing to 77 total chips before multiplying. Once I play the straight, I’ll end the round with money left for shopping. After winning, I'd still have two hands remaining, making this the best move to ensure I reach my goal.\n**Setting up the card selection**\n\nI need to select the card positions for my intended straight hand: I’ll choose 9h from position 2, Qd from position 5, Jd from position 6, 10d from position 7, and 8d from position 8. The order of the cards doesn’t matter since it's a straight. I’m estimating the chip value to be around 308. Now, I’ll craft my response in the required JSON format for the action to share!\n"
