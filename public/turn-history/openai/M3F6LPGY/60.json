{"reasoning":"**Choosing planets from Mega Celestial pack**\n\nI need to choose two planets from the Mega Celestial pack. The Zany Joker focuses on the three of a kind. Looking at our levels, we have a full house, straight, and flush at level 2, and others at level 1. The planets available are Mercury, Uranus, Venus, Pluto, and Mars. Notably, Venus offers a great synergy with Zany Joker for three of a kind, while Mars also improves our four of a kind.\n**Evaluating hand options**\n\nI’m considering whether to take the four of a kind to level 3, which would give me a base of 120 chips after a +30 chip increase and a +3 multiplier. While a four of a kind is harder to achieve, it can score high. Alternatively, I could go for Mercury for a pair, which is easier but scores lower. With Zany Joker offering a +12 multiplier if I contain a three of a kind, I feel more inclined to focus on improving my three of a kind hands.\n**Selecting planets in Balatro**\n\nIn Balatro, “contains” means a hand can form with cards. For example, a four of a kind indeed contains a three of a kind. So, Zany can trigger bonuses on hands like full houses or four of a kinds. My strategy should focus on making those hand types common. While Venus helps with increasing three of a kind value, my fallback plans for lower hands should be ready. I think I’ll choose Venus first since pursuing duplicates later with Mars can be an option after. After selecting Venus, I'll see the remaining planets.\n**Making selections in JSON format**\n\nI’m going to remove the chosen card and reduce my selections for the next choice. I’ll select position 3 now. To do this, I need to output the action in JSON format. I’ll structure it as \"action\": \"select\" with the positions in an array, which will include the pack card position and possible hand positions. My schema will have the action and positions defined as a list of integers, so it’ll look like this: [3], while keeping the intended hand type and estimated chips as null.\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
