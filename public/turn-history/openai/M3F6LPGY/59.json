{"reasoning":"**Considering options for purchases**\n\nI'm looking at Mega Celestial, which offers a good value with planet choices, where I can pick two. It seems like the best use of $6. Alternatively, I could buy a Credit Card for $1 plus a pack. The Credit Card allows me to take on debt for expensive items later, but I already have the Clearance Sale. Still, I might choose the Credit Card since it's cheap and can help with future purchases when cash is low.\n**Evaluating planet and card options**\n\nSo, Mega Celestial is appealing for immediate scaling, but I have to choose two planets to use right away. I'm considering options like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, or Earth, though getting exactly what I want is tricky. I'd prefer planets over a Credit Card at this point. Even though buying Mega Celestial takes my entire $6 and leaves me with no money later, I think it's worth it. The standard packs are interesting but seem less effective than focusing on planets now. So, I should go for one Mega Celestial booster.\n**Planning the next steps**\n\nI’m preparing to choose the planets, but that will come later. For now, my immediate action is to buy one booster. I need to make sure to format the return in JSON, including the action field and the relevant positions. This way, I'll keep everything organized and clear for the next steps. Let's get this booster set up properly!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
