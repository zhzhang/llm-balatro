{"reasoning":"**Considering reroll strategy**\n\nI've already bought what I want, but I could reroll to see new cards and possibly buy more. The reroll cost starts at $0 but might increase by $1 each time. With the D6 tag effect applied, the first reroll is free, and the next would cost $1. I should definitely use the first free reroll to look for better jokers, but I have to make sure I don’t lose the chance to buy booster packs!\n**Evaluating strategy for hands**\n\nI need to consider if I'm focusing on building straights or full houses. The deck appears random, but I’ve had success with both types. Leveling a straight or full house with a planet could be beneficial. When looking at a celestial pack, there are options like Jupiter for a straight, but let’s clarify: Mercury gives a pair, Venus provides three of a kind. The mapping in Balatro shows that Saturn is ideal for a straight or Earth for a full house!\n**Considering purchase options**\n\nThe pack costs $3, and it could be worth it since I can choose the best of three planets. Hopefully, at least one will be useful. I could also opt for a free reroll for jokers, which might have a bigger impact than just a small planet boost in early levels. \n\nJudgement creates a random Joker for $2, which might be great or entirely worthless. Since I only have the Zany Joker, I really need another for scoring. I think it might be best to skip Judgement and use the free reroll to find better jokers instead!\n**Planning my next moves**\n\nI think the optimal choice is to buy the Drunkard now, then reroll the shop for new cards. If a strong joker appears, I can buy it later, and celestial packs will still be available since rerolls only replace shop cards. After buying the Drunkard, I'll take my time to decide on my next action. The task requires a single action command, so I'll proceed with buying the Drunkard. \n\nIt adds a +1 discard each round and gives an extra joker slot, which is useful! With Negative Jokers taking no existing slot but increasing the max, this should work out nicely.\n**Confirming the effects of Drunkard**\n\nThe Negative edition of the Drunkard joker gives +1 joker slot and doesn't count towards the joker limit. There’s also a built-in +1 joker slot with Drunkard itself, which should stack! So, buying the Negative Drunkard might actually provide a total of +2 joker slots. Currently, my max jokers are 5, so after getting the Negative Drunkard, that could rise to 7. This seems like a solid plan, so I’ll go ahead and buy it!\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
