{"reasoning":"**Considering game mechanics**\n\nI'm at a point in the game where I can't skip my turn, so I need to play the round. I’m thinking about the order of my jokers: Zany gives a +12 multiplier if I have three of a kind, while Photograph doubles the first played face card when scored. It turns out Photograph triggers when I score; this means its order matters less compared to Zany's independence. So, I don't need to rearrange them. Plus, I need to remember that cards played earlier in this ante are debuffed.\n**Planning the next move**\n\nSince I skipped both small and big blinds, no cards have been played in this ante, which means there's no debuff affecting me. That’s a relief! I should go ahead and play the round. I can estimate my chips to be around 1600, likely within the next 2-3 hands at Level 2, especially with cards like Photograph in play. I’ll need to provide an action JSON for this play. Let's get started!\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
