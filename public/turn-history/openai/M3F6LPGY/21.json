{"reasoning":"**Evaluating card strategy**\n\nI think it's best to win with as few hands as possible and avoid reusing the same card. While reusing might happen if I redraw from a 44-card deck, it's unlikely. The cards in the first hand should be okay. Our objective is to create a high-scoring hand, possibly aiming for a strong three of a kind with a face card. Currently, I have options for pairs of 8s or Jacks, and I’m considering the possibility of a flush or using a pair of Jacks strategically.\n**Assessing scoring strategy**\n\nI’d focus on making a pair of Jacks with additional cards that don’t contribute to the score. Jacks are key because they score the chips and trigger effects. I need to keep in mind that the Photograph triggers on the first played face card when scored, so placing a Jack first in the play order is crucial. If I score with that Jack, I’ll get a multiplied score. This means I should maximize my selection to include Jacks effectively to benefit from the multiplier.\n**Understanding joker scoring**\n\nI’m dealing with a scoring joker that gives a x2 multiplier when that card scores. This means that for that card's scoring event, the multiplier doubles and persists for the entire hand. Scoring order matters because each card adds chips and can trigger jokers that modify the multiplier. If Photograph, which boosts the multiplier based on the first scored face card, is played early, it benefits later cards too. To optimize, I'll arrange the play order and likely play the Jack first. The Zany joker works independently, giving a separate multiplier for a Three of a Kind.\n**Clarifying joker mechanics**\n\nIt seems the joker functions independently and adds a +12 multiplier regardless of card order, which is significant for achieving a Three of a Kind. To hit this target, I might consider discarding some cards to aim for trip 8s or trip Jacks. Since I have four hands and discards available, I need to reach 1600 chips. My level 2 straight already scored well, and if I use Photograph for x2, that could enhance my score considerably. Looking at previous scoring, it's likely that the Photograph doubled the multiplier effectively.\n**Deciding on strategy**\n\nI believe I can reach 1600 chips in 3-4 hands, and I have to decide whether to play or discard. I might aim for a flush since I have 4 spades, potentially discarding non-spades to draw one more. The flush has a decent scoring base and could yield around 568 chips with multiplier boosts. Alternatively, I could also pursue a Three of a Kind with 8s or Jacks, but I'd need to draw a specific card from the deck. It’s a balancing act of maximizing my chances across multiple hands.\n**Formulating the optimal play**\n\nI have a potential plan that involves keeping the two Jacks and two 8s in my hand, aiming for a Full House. I would need to draw either a third Jack or an 8 to complete it, which seems promising since both would trigger the relevant Jokers for scoring. My first action should be to discard the other cards while maximizing my chances of drawing what I need. If successful, I'd get a strong score from the Full House with boosts from the Jokers. Discarding wisely is key to clearing this game efficiently!\n**Planning the discard strategy**\n\nI'm considering keeping the four key cards: the two Jacks and two 8s, while discarding four others: the 6♠, 5♠, A♥, and K♦. This way, I can draw four new cards and improve my chances of getting another Jack or 8. The probability of hitting at least one out is about 32.7%, which is decent. I have to be cautious with discard decisions since they won’t reduce my hands, allowing me to attempt multiple times. Time to proceed with the discard!\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,7]"}
