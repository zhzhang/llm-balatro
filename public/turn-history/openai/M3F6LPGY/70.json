My hand features pairs of 9s, 8s, and Jacks, which gives me three pairs. I\\u2019m considering possible outcomes like a straight or a flush, but I realize I need a fifth card of the same suit for a flush and can't form a straight, either. Discarding to aim for a three of a kind could be the best route, given I still have two discards to use.\\n**Calculating poker scoring needs**\\n\\nTo reach 7500 chips with minimal scoring, I\\u2019m looking at averaging about 1875 per hand. Without strong jokers, that\\u2019s a challenge; I need at least full houses or Zany-boosted trips. My hand can reach Four of a Kind, level 3 strong, but I'm stuck at pairs. I could build a full house with a trip and a pair, which would increase my potential score. However, since I need four hands to do this, it\\u2019s going to be tough. I\\u2019m trying to clarify if Four of a Kind contains three of a kind.\\n**Clarifying four of a kind in poker**\\n\\nI\\u2019m trying to figure out if a Four of a Kind contains a Three of a Kind. In poker, it seems that I can form a Three of a Kind from four cards, which works in Balatro too. That means Zany should trigger for Four of a Kind since it contains a Three of a Kind. Total chips for a hand with Jacks and a kicker would be 169. Since all five cards participate, the final score could reach 4225. With two such hands, I could easily exceed 7500 chips, so I'll focus on chasing a Four of a Kind with my discards.\\n**Evaluating card discards and draws**\\n\\nI realize that I have two Jacks in hand, which means there are two remaining in the deck. The same goes for the 9s and 8s, so I could potentially draw more of those. I already have three pairs, and I\\u2019m contemplating whether to keep all three pairs while discarding others like the 10h, 4h, and 5d. Since I can discard up to five cards, I should decide between keeping pairs of Jacks, 9s, or 8s while ensuring my hand remains strong.\\n**Deciding on discards and draws**\\n\\nI\\u2019m weighing my options between keeping more pairs to increase my chances of forming a trip or full house versus discarding to draw new cards. I can discard three cards now and see how that goes before potentially discarding up to five later. I\\u2019m thinking of discarding the 10h, 4h, and 5d to leave 9h, 8h, Jc, 8c, and Jd. This gives me a good shot at hitting a trip or a full house. I\\u2019ll check the probabilities, and we seem to have about a 46.4% chance to draw at least one relevant card. So, I\\u2019ll move forward with those discards!\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 4 9\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 69]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 6\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

I'm in the big blind and need to gather 7500 chips, with four hands left and just one discard remaining. My hand includes several combinations, like three 9s which already gives me a Three of a Kind, plus two 8s and two Jacks which could form a Full House. \\n\\nIf I use three 9s and two 8s, that gives me 108 chips. With multipliers applied, my total comes to 1944 chips.\\n**Evaluating poker hand options**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering my card combinations again. If I go for three 9s and two Jacks, I get a stronger total of 2016 chips. However, I can't make a Four of a Kind since there are only three 9s. I can't form a Straight or a Flush either. The best option seems to be a Full House with 9s and Jacks. \\n\\nI could attempt to use the discard to draw for a fourth 9, but there\\u2019s only one left in the deck, while there are still two Jacks available.\\n**Assessing full house strategy**\\n\\nI'm looking at my current Full House, which yields around 2000 chips, but I need 7500 total. With four hands left, I need an average of 1875 per hand. If I manage to play a few Full Houses, I could reach around 8000. \\n\\nWhen I play, I'll choose up to 5 cards that will be removed, and then I'll draw the same number to refill my hand. So, I could actually play a 5-card Full House using my 999JJ. After that, I'd have A\\u2660 K\\u2660 8\\u2665 8\\u2663 remaining. I might want to discard the A, K, or 8s for the next round.\\n**Evaluating hand strategies**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering whether I should discard to try for a Four of a Kind with 9s or a higher-rank Full House. However, my current Full House with 9s and Jacks is already a strong hand, and I think I should play it now to start scoring, since I have plenty of hands left.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s calculate the expected chips: for the Full House, I have a base of 65 chips with a multiplier of 6, plus 47 from the cards, leading to a total of 2016 chips. After playing one hand, I would need an average of 1828 chips over the next three hands to stay on track. Keeping the pair of 8s could help create future Full Houses or Three of a Kind hands.\\n**Deciding on poker strategy**\\n\\nTo reach 7500 chips, I\\u2019ll need Full Houses for each hand. If my future draws don\\u2019t go well, I might need to use my discard wisely. So, it makes sense to play a Full House now and keep the discard option open for a later hand if necessary. \\n\\nI'm considering which Full House to play: if I go with 999JJ, I keep A, K, and 8s. But if I choose 99988, I'll keep the Jacks, which is stronger. So, I'll pick 9\\u2665 9\\u2663 9\\u2666 J\\u2663 J\\u2666 and declare my intended hand type as \\\"full house.\\\" Our estimated chips for this hand should be 2016. Let's go for it!\\n\\nCommand: play 3 6 9 5 8 full house 2016\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 70]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 6\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

With a 9-card hand, I can discard up to 5 cards, focusing on keeping the most promising ones. I think about sticking with my pairs and high cards, but I need to decide which cards might help me build towards a better hand. Ultimately, keeping both 8s and some high cards while discarding others seems like a good strategy. Discarding 5 would still leave me with a 9-card hand since I'd draw 5 new cards.\\n**Evaluating card options**\\n\\nI'm trying to figure out if keeping my spades (A, K, J) for a possible flush is worth it. I currently have 3 spades, and there are 7 left in the deck. I could try discarding some cards, but a flush seems insufficient as it wouldn\\u2019t give me enough chips. Instead, aiming for either a full house or four of a kind seems more promising. With Zany, I could potentially score significantly higher, so focusing on those options might be the best path forward.\\n**Calculating hand values**\\n\\nI'm working on a strategy for forming a full house. It seems like I could potentially score around 2k for that. If I stick with three of a kind, it\\u2019s looking like I\\u2019d get about 1.2k instead, which isn't quite enough. Achieving multiple full houses is difficult, but with three hands left, I should aim for at least one full house and maybe a few three of a kinds to boost my total. I want to leverage my pair of 8s to aim for trips and create a full house with additional pairs too.\\n**Strategizing discards**\\n\\nI think the best plan is to use discards to aim for a third 8 and possibly another pair. I'm considering which cards to let go of, maybe A\\u2660, K\\u2660, J\\u2660, and 2\\u2663, but should I keep 4\\u2666 and 7\\u2666? Honestly, it's tough to decide what to keep when I can only discard 5 cards. I definitely want to hold onto the pair of 8s, but maybe I should keep higher duplicates for better chances instead. Since I\\u2019ll draw 5 new cards if I discard 5, it\\u2019s all about maximizing my opportunities!\\n**Calculating discard strategy**\\n\\nI'm thinking about the probability of drawing another 8. With 2 eights left in a 25-card deck, I calculated that the chances of getting at least one 8 is about 36.7%, which isn't too shabby! If I keep my pairs, it might reduce my chances. I need to decide which 5 cards to discard, possibly letting go of lower cards while keeping high ranks for potential pairs. Keeping both 8s along with an Ace and a King sounds like the best plan, so I think I\\u2019ll discard the J\\u2660, 5\\u2665, 2\\u2663, 7\\u2666, and 4\\u2666. Then, I'll draw 5 new cards and evaluate my hand.\\n\\nCommand: discard 3 5 7 8 9\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 6\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.
