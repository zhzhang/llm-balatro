{"reasoning":"**Considering shop options**\n\nI’m thinking about what to buy in the shop after beating the big blind ante. We have $15 to spend. The options include the Photograph Joker for $5, Saturn for $3, and some boosters priced at $4 each. It seems like Photograph could be strong if I play a face card first, but it requires certain conditions to trigger. I could buy both the Photograph and Saturn for $8, leaving me with $7, or consider a booster. It's worth considering how flexible my hands have been so far.\n**Deciding on shop purchases**\n\nI'm considering buying Saturn, as leveling a straight yields chips and multipliers for future rounds, and it's inexpensive at the early ante stage. I realize that Saturn is categorized as a consumable, so I can buy and use it immediately. I can spend $3 on Saturn to level up my straight. After that, I could buy the Photograph, which costs $5. This way, I can enhance my strategy while keeping my spend efficient.\n**Evaluating purchases and strategy**\n\nAfter buying Saturn and Photograph, I'm left with $7, which allows me to consider a booster pack. I think the Buffoon pack could give me better jokers than the Photograph since it offers a choice of jokers. The Buffoon pack costs $4, leaving me with $3 afterward. While the Director's Cut voucher is appealing for later challenges, I’m focusing on enhancing my joker options now. So, my plan is to buy and use Saturn first, then get the Photograph, and finally the Buffoon pack.\n**Determining my purchasing strategy**\n\nIn this interface, buying a booster pack will lead to the next step where I choose from the options. I’m weighing whether to buy the Buffoon pack first, as it may give me a better joker compared to the Photograph. While the Photograph is cheap, I can sell it later, but not for much. Since I have to choose one action, I think buying the Buffoon pack first makes the most sense to gather more information while keeping the option to use Saturn later.\n**Planning the next purchase**\n\nI realize that buying Saturn now doesn’t limit my ability to buy a booster later. However, to maximize information, I think it makes sense to buy the booster first to check for straight or face card synergy. While there’s a risk with RNG, I can choose from up to two jokers, and I still might want the Photograph later. Since I have $15, buying the booster for $4 leaves me with $11, allowing for other options too. So, let's proceed with buying the booster!\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
