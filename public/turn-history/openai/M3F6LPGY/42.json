{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm in a shop with $3, and celestial packs each cost $3. Since I don’t have any cards, I can reroll for free, which might give me new jokers or consumables. Previously, the reroll cost was tied to a D6 tag, and now that’s changed to $0. I should reroll without spending before deciding which pack to buy. This way, I can also save my money for potential good cards that might show up after rerolling.\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
