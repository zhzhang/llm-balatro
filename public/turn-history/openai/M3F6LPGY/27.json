{"reasoning":"**Evaluating strategy with cards**\n\nI'm in a situation where I have $1, which isn't enough to buy anything. I can either round_select or sell a joker to afford Earth. Selling the Photograph for $2 could help me buy Earth, but that means I'd have to let go of a strong card. Although the Photograph has great multiplier potential with face cards, Earth would significantly level up my full house strategy. I wonder if I should keep the Photograph and sell Zany instead, even though that has a big multiplier too.\n**Comparing card strategies**\n\nSelling the Photograph nets me $2, which makes my total $3, allowing me to buy Earth for $2 and still have $1 left. Earth offers great boosts: +25 chips and +2 multiplier to my base. However, the Photograph could give me a x2 multiplier, which might outweigh losing Earth depending on the situation. Currently, my full house scoring is around 81 chips, and with Zany's bonus, that brings it to 16. If I play a face card first, the multiplier could double, making a theoretical 2,592 chips! But last time, it only scored 1,620.\n**Analyzing scoring discrepancies**\n\nI'm wondering why there’s a discrepancy in my scoring. Maybe the Photograph only triggers once and affects just that card, giving a x2 multiplier when it's scored. This would mean the multiplier doubles then, impacting the remaining cards. In Balatro, cards score sequentially, so each adds chips based on the current multiplier, rather than a total multiplier at the end. Since my last full house scored 1,620 instead of the expected 2,592, it looks like I may have made some incorrect assumptions. However, the boss doesn't debuff previously played cards in this Ante.\n**Understanding full house scoring**\n\nI built my full house with 7s and queens, and if I play a queen first, it should trigger the x2 multiplier. My base multiplier is 4, and adding Zany's +12 brings it to 16, then the Photograph would double that to 32. Initially, I calculated chips as 81, thinking I could achieve 2,592, but the actual score was 1,620, which corresponds with a multiplier of 20. This means Zany activates after Photograph during scoring. If I sell Photograph for Earth, my new base chips change to 65 with a multiplier of 6, adding Zany's +12 after scoring as well.\n**Deciding on card strategy**\n\nI have a total of 106 chips with a base of 65 and card chips of 41, which would give me 1,908 chips if I could use Earth right now. That's 288 more than my current score of 1,620. Losing the Photograph means missing out on its multiplier potential. However, Earth offers permanent upgrades to my full house strategy, which is crucial. Selling the Photograph would give me the funds for Earth, but I'd lose a major multiplier. It seems wise to sell the Photograph now, as Earth could disappear from the shop. So I'll sell it first and then plan to buy Earth next.\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
