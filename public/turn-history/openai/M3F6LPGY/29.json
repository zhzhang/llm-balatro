{"reasoning":"**Evaluating options in shop**\n\nI'm in a shop with $1, which limits my buying choices. I can't afford Jupiter, boosters, or any other upgrades. Selling the Zany Joker gives me $1, making $2, but I'm wondering if buying Jupiter is worth it. Upgrading the Flush offers significant rewards, but my focus is on building a strong hand like a full house or straight. Since the Zany Joker has a large multiplier effect, I think it's best to keep it and select a round instead to earn more.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
