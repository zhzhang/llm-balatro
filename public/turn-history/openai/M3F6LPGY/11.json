{"reasoning":"**Evaluating shop options**\n\nI'm at the shop with $3, but I can't afford the celestial pack for $4. I have a $10 voucher, but rerolls cost $5, and there are no cards to buy. So, I think the best move is to end my shop round. I should consider rearranging jokers since the order could matter for triggers. The Photograph triggers scoring with the first played face card when scored. Zany seems to be independent and conditional. I'll proceed with the round selection.\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
