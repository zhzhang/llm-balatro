{"reasoning":"**Considering options with no funds**\n\nI'm in a shop with no money, so I can't buy anything right now. I'll need to move on to the next step, which is round selection.

It’s a little disappointing not to make any purchases, but I'll focus on what's next and make the best of it!\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
