{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Selection: Prioritizing Flush Synergy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in Ante 3, Round 4, deep in a PLANET_PACK. I've got $5 and a solid Joker lineup: Zany, Odd Todd, Abstract, Turtle Bean, and, crucially, The Tribe which doubles Flush Multiplier. My hand levels are decent, with Full House at 3, Flush at 2, and Four of a Kind at 2. The other hands are level 1. I have three Planet choices: Saturn (Straight), Uranus (Two Pair), and Jupiter (Flush).\n\nGiven my hand and Jokers, especially The Tribe, leveling up Flush is the clear winning play here. My current Flush level is 2, with 50 Chips and 6 Multiplier. Jupiter will add +15 Chips and +2 Multiplier to Flush. So, the new level will be 3 with 65 Chips and 8 Multiplier.\n\nThen, with Abstract Joker giving +15 Multiplier and The Tribe doubling it, we get: base Multiplier 8 + 15 = 23; then 23 * 2 = 46. That's a whopping 65 * 46 = 2990 Chips! Obviously, this doesn't account for card chips or Odd Todd, but it illustrates the power of this synergy.\n\nSo, I need to select Jupiter (position 3).\n\nThe base command is `select <pack_card_position>`. Based on the current parameters, I’ll set:\n*   `action`: \"select\"\n*   `positions`: [3]\n*   `intended_hand_type`: null (because I'm not selecting cards for a hand yet, just picking a card)\n*   `estimated_chips`: null\n\n*Wait, hold on.* I should specify that I'm intending to level up a Flush in my thought process. The prompt *allows* specifying the `intended_hand_type` and `estimated_chips`. Since I'm selecting a planet card to level up a specific hand, let’s refine:\n\n*   `action`: \"select\"\n*   `positions`: [3]\n*   `intended_hand_type`: null\n*   `estimated_chips`: null\n\nOkay, double checking. The command remains `select <pack_card_position>`. The indices are: 1: Saturn, 2: Uranus, and 3: Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is: `select` Position: `3`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
