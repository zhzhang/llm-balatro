{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shopping Spree**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 3, Round 5, and I'm in the SHOP phase. I've got $20, which is decent, and my hand is leaning heavily towards a Flush build, which is at level 3. My target is the Ante 3 Boss, which needs 4,000 chips, and I have just played a Flush that scored 7,498 chips. I'm feeling good about that. I just sold the Zany Joker to free up a Joker slot for the Gift Card.\n\nI have some interesting cards available:\n\n*   **Gift Card:** This is the priority. It's free and adds a $1 sell value to jokers and consumables at the end of the round. This is huge for my economy and will power up the Abstract Joker.\n*   **Mars:** Also free, and levels up Four of a Kind, which I might be able to get use of at some point.\n*   **Standard Pack:** Again, free. Always good for the long game.\n*   **Telescope Voucher:** This costs $10. It *guarantees* that Planet packs will contain the most played hand, which is Flushes, so this is a must-have.\n*   **The Hanged Man:** I can't use The Hanged Man to destroy cards in the shop (I tried `use_consumable` command, but no targets), so I will need to wait until the round to do this.\n\nMy plan is crystal clear:\n\n1.  **Buy the Gift Card.** This is the immediate priority. It's free and gets Abstract Joker going right away.\n2.  **Buy and Use Mars.** It levels up Four of a Kind. I can hopefully fit this in somewhere.\n3.  **Buy the Standard Pack.** More cards are always useful.\n4.  **Buy the Telescope.** This is a must-buy, and I have enough money to get this.\n5.  **Proceed to the Round.**\n\nFirst things first: I'm going to buy the Gift Card. I'll execute that now. No reason to delay.\n\nOkay, let's get this done.\n```\nAction: buy_card\nCard position: 1\n```\nNo brainer.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
