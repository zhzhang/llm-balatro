{"reasoning":"**Current Turn Strategy: High Variance, High Reward**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 14, Ante 7/8, and I've got $44 to play with in the shop. The objective, as always, is to maximize my hand value. Right now, I'm running a strong Flush build, Level 8, with a base of 140 chips and 18 mult. My Joker lineup is pretty solid: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, To the Moon (a holo one, even!), Gift Card, The Tribe, and Acrobat. I've got six Joker slots filled, thanks to that Gift Card. The Gift Card actually gives me a positive effect: it provides an additional slot, unlike some negative Jokers.\n\nMy current priority is maximizing my multiplier for the Flush, and it looks like the shop has some powerful options. The Jumbo Spectral Pack is a no-brainer at $6. Spectral packs can offer cards like Ankh (copy a Joker), Wraith (Random Rare Joker), Hex (Polychrome), Immolate (destroy 5 cards, gain $20), and Sigil (change all cards to one suit). These are game changers at this stage of the game, and for just $6, it's a steal. I am expecting some of these effects to dramatically change my multiplier.\n\nFortune Teller (+8 mult) is okay, but it's not better than what I have and I am not looking to sell anything. Pluto (High Card) is completely irrelevant for my Flush strategy. Hone (Voucher) is decent for the future, but right now I need immediate power, and I already have a positive economy.\n\nSo, the plan is to immediately acquire a Jumbo Spectral Pack. Let's make sure I'm doing the right thing, by double-checking: Jumbo Spectral pack, `buy_booster 1`, which should cost $6, leaving me with $38. Easy. \n\nBefore I commit to buying the booster, I'm confirming that I am using my 6 Joker slots, and making sure my Jokers are ordered in a reasonable way. The positive mult Jokers come first, followed by the multiplicative Jokers.\n\nFinal Action: `buy_booster 1`. Let's see what the Spectral pack holds!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
