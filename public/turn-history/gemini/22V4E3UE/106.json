{"reasoning":"**A Moment of Calculated Hesitation**\n\nOkay, here we are: Ante 6, Round 11. Back in the shop after using the Spectral Pack. I've got $20, six Jokers (effectively seven with the Gift Card's negative effect), and a Flush that's currently level 5. My gut tells me this is where things get interesting. I'm prioritizing interest generation, and that's usually the right call. \"To the Moon\" is giving me a big bonus here.\n\nLet's do a quick run-down of my options:\n\n*   **Riff-raff:** Potentially useful for the Abstract Joker and the Gift Card's sell value. But I have 7 slots already, so it might not be worth the cost.\n*   **Business Card:** Not relevant to the Odd Todd/Flush build.\n*   **Standard Pack:** Cheap enough at $4 to maybe give me a card that could really shift the deck to the positive.\n*   **Hone Voucher:** Very tempting for long-term value, but $10 is a big chunk of my current capital.\n\nMy thoughts are this: The shop doesn't have anything truly \"must-buy\". I've got a solid Flush build, with the Tribe as the engine and Odd Todd for chip generation. Acrobat is the finisher, and \"To the Moon\" is printing money. It feels like \"round\\_select\" is the best option right now. Let the high interest continue and hope for better opportunities later.\n\nHowever, I just used \"Grim,\" so I really need to see what aces I now have. I'm going to hold off on spending for now, because \"To The Moon\" is too good to pass up.\n\nHold up. Should I just `buy_booster`? It's a small gamble that could be a huge win if I get a good card.\n\nOkay, wait, let me think this through. My current hand is barely getting through the small blind. I really need to get some more power.\n\nReroll costs $5 and would be tempting to try to find a Celestial Pack. That would give me Jupiter, which is what I really need. But `round_select` is safer.\n\nOkay, standard play: I'll stick to maximizing the \"To the Moon\" interest by passing on these cards.\n\nBut I really should try to level up this Flush, and a single good card would be the key here. It's cheap enough to check the Standard Pack.\n\nNope. The safe play: `round_select`. Let's see if the next shop is better.\n\nHowever, let me check the Standard Pack one more time. Wait, I keep being tempted by this cheap option. I just really want to improve this Flush.\n\nNo. I need to maximize that interest to see what the next shop gives us. We are going with `round_select`.\n\nFinally, for the final, *final* time, let me check the Standard Pack.\n\nNope, no, let's keep that interest.\n\nMy final and *definitive* decision is to go with `round\\_select`. I need to generate capital for Jupiter or better Jokers.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
