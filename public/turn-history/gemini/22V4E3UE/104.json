{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State and Making a Play**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 6, Round 11. I just beat Ante 5, so this makes sense. Let's see, I have $26. My Jokers are pretty solid: Odd Todd for chips, Abstract and To the Moon for a good mult boost, The Tribe for the Flush multiplier, Acrobat as a safety net, and Gift Card boosting sell values and giving me an extra Joker slot, which is important. My Voucher, Telescope, is useless, and Flush is level 5. This Odd Todd, The Tribe, and Flush combination is really strong, with To the Moon for scaling, Acrobat as insurance, and Gift Card for sell value.\n\nNow, looking at the shop: Riff-raff is a Joker generator, which I can't use because I'm full; I have 6 jokers and 7 slots because of Gift Card. Business Card isn't useful for my flush build because it focuses on face cards, and I don't need those with Odd Todd. Then there are the packs: a Jumbo Spectral Pack for $6, a Standard Pack for $4, and a Hone Voucher for $10. I also have the option to Reroll for $5.\n\nA Jumbo Spectral Pack is almost always worth it if I can afford it, especially since I need to scale for Ante 8, and Hone is good long term, but Spectral might give an immediate power spike. I have $26, so the Spectral pack is the obvious choice. I can still have $20 for interest, and To the Moon says I get an extra $1 of interest for every $5 I have.\n\nSo, I'm going to buy the Jumbo Spectral Pack. The prompt asks for a JSON, so the action is `buy_booster` with position `[1]`.\n\nShould I rearrange the jokers? I'll re-check: Odd Todd (Chips), Abstract (+Mult), To the Moon (+Mult), Gift Card (Scaling), The Tribe (x2 Mult), Acrobat (x3 Mult). Order of operations is: played cards (Odd Todd), Independent Jokers (Abstract, To the Moon, The Tribe, Acrobat). The additive mult should be before the multiplicative, so the order is fine: Odd Todd, Abstract, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, Acrobat.\n\nSo, I'm buying the Spectral Pack. My interest with $26 is $10. If I buy the pack, I have $20, so it's a loss of $2, but it's worth it for the cards. I'm choosing the Jumbo Spectral Pack.\n\nJust a final check: the action is `buy_booster` with positions `[1]`. Also, Gift Card increases Joker sell values by $1. So I am ready.\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
