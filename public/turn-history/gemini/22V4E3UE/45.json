{"reasoning":"**My Turn: Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking: Ante 3, Round 5. I have $18, aiming for the Ante 3 Boss (4000 threshold). The Coupon Tag is active, so several items are free, but I'm primarily focused on long-term scaling here.\n\nMy current jokers are: Zany Joker (useless for my Flush build), Odd Todd, Abstract, Turtle Bean, and The Tribe (essential X2 for Flushes). I also have a Hanged Man consumable, but it's not immediately relevant in the SHOP phase because I can't view my hand cards to target them. The Gift Card, Mars, and the Standard Pack are free. I also have the Telescope voucher for $10.\n\nMy immediate priority: Maximizing value. The Gift Card, which increases joker/consumable sell value, is *critical* for long-term economy, especially given the number of jokers I'm building. Since I have 5/5 jokers, I *must* sell one to get the Gift Card. Zany Joker's +12 Mult for 3-of-a-kind is useless for my Flush strategy, so that's the obvious choice.\n\nI should also buy and use the free Mars planet, since it's an immediate upgrade for potential 4-of-a-kind hands and free. Standard Pack is also a no-brainer. The Telescope is the only item I need to *purchase*, and I can easily afford it with $8 leftover.\n\nThe *order* of operations matters here. The Gift Card's value increases *at the end of the round*.\n\nSince I'm focused on a *single action*, it will be `sell_joker 1`. I need to ensure that the command I am submitting is the only one I submit. My only job is to provide one action, no more.\n\nTo confirm the positions:\nJokers: 1: Zany, 2: Odd Todd, 3: Abstract, 4: Turtle Bean, 5: The Tribe.\n\nShop Items:\n1: Gift Card\n2: Mars\n\nI'll execute that action first. Then, in the next round, I can buy Gift Card, buy and use Mars, buy the Standard Pack and buy the Telescope.\nI am selling Zany.\nThe action is `sell_joker`.\nThe position is `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
