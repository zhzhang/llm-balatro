{"reasoning":"**Current Strategic Analysis: Round 3 Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 2, Round 3, at the SHOP phase. I've got $15 to work with. Let's see... my inventory is decent: I've got the Zany Joker, which is handy for those 3-of-a-kind situations, and The Tribe, the Flush multiplier. Odd Todd is alright for early chip boosts. Right now, I'm at Full House Level 2 and Flush Level 2.\n\nLooking at the shop, the *Turtle Bean* is tempting for the immediate hand size boost, but I'm more interested in long-term power scaling. The *Abstract Joker* is definitely the key here - +3 Mult per Joker, and I already have 3, so buying this gives a flat +12 mult, for any hand, which is HUGE. This solidifies my strategy. This is especially good because it's a permanent buff that works for *any* hand, be it Flush or 3-of-a-kind.\n\nThe *Celestial Pack* is my next best option. It's a reliable way to level up my Flush or Full House, which is crucial for scaling. A *Jumbo Standard Pack* might be okay, but I can't rely on getting specific cards, so it's less reliable for my needs. The *Crystal Ball* is also not a priority, since I don't have a consumable slot yet.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'm going to buy the *Abstract Joker* for $4. This will leave me with $11. Buying the *Celestial Pack* for $4, and leaving me with $7, means I'm 2 shy of getting interest from $5, so I might need to make a decision later.\n\nBuying the *Abstract Joker* means my Flush mult will go from (6 + 12) * 2 = 36 and my 3-of-a-kind to (3 + 12 + 12) = 27 which is great. I can now scale up Flush and Full House.\n\nGiven I need to pick one hand for the next boss (The Pillar), scaling these hand types is vital.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.  **Buy Abstract Joker (buy_card 2)**.\n2.  **Buy Celestial Pack (buy\\_booster 2)**.\n3.  Evaluate next turn.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
