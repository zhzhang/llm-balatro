{"reasoning":"**Current Play Strategy: Diamond Flush with a Wild Card Twist**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 6/8, Round 12, small blind. I need 20,000 chips to clear this. I've got 4 hands and 3 discards, with $20 in the bank. My hand is: 6♠ (Wild), 6♥, 4♥, 2♣, 10♦, 3♦, 3♦. My Joker setup is: Odd Todd, Abstract, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, Acrobat. My Flush level is at 5.\n\nThe immediate goal is to win, preferably with the 6♠ still in hand to trigger its \"Planet\" bonus at the end of the round. A Diamond flush seems like the best play given what I have. I'm already sitting on a 10♦, 3♦, and 3♦. To maximize value, I should aim for an Odd Todd Flush, since I have Odd Todd as a Joker.\n\nLet me calculate: if I hit 9♦, 7♦, and 5♦: the base 5-card flush nets me 95 chips, 12x mult, 4 odd cards * 31 chips = 124 chips, 10 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 34 chips, totaling 253. With my Jokers, I can get 12 (base) + 18 (Abstract) + 10 (To the Moon) = 40x mult; The Tribe gives me 80x mult. 253 * 80 gets me 20,240, which would be enough. This is enough to win.\n\nThe 6♠ is my wildcard, so I should hold it for the end. That means I need to discard the 6♥, 4♥, and 2♣ and hope to draw more Diamonds and preferably odd-numbered ones.\n\nI'm keeping the 6♠, 10♦, 3♦, and 3♦. I'll discard cards in positions 2, 3, and 4. I can discard up to 5 cards this round, but I can't think of a better play right now. So, the action is discard in positions 2, 3, and 4. I should be able to get two more diamonds.\n\nNow, let's check the Joker order: Odd Todd, Abstract, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, Acrobat. Additive before multiplicative, yes. Correct. Gift Card's value scales at the end, To the Moon interest applies at the end too.\n\nFinal Check: the deck has a lot of odds left. The ranks I need are Ace, 9, 7, 5, or 3. I have 14 diamonds in the deck. Odds of getting a Diamond are pretty good.\nThe next action is to discard: Discard the 6♥, 4♥, and 2♣.\nSo the final action is: `\"action\": \"discard\", \"positions\": [2, 3, 4]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4]"}
