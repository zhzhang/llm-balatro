{"reasoning":"**The Spectral Pack: A Calculated Risk**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 6. I've got $20 and a solid flush-focused build going. My jokers are Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, Turtle Bean, The Tribe, and Gift Card. The Tribe is the linchpin, and the Telescope voucher means I'm aiming for those sweet Planet cards in Celestial packs. Flushes are my bread and butter (level 3, 3 plays).\n\nI'm in the shop, and I need to make some decisions. Sly Joker and Square Joker are non-starters. They don't mesh with my Flush strategy. I could consider a re-roll, but the Spectral Pack at $4 is tempting. It’s high-risk, high-reward, but it could really supercharge my build, especially with The Tribe. I could get something like \"Ankh\" (copy The Tribe – imagine that x4 Mult for flushes!) or \"Hex\" (Polychrome The Tribe, x1.5 Mult) or even \"Wraith,\" which could give me a rare joker. The downside is that I could end up losing my other jokers, and while Gift Card is nice for sell value, it's not contributing to score. Turtle Bean is decaying and Abstract Joker is okay, but I can improve on this.\n\nA Jumbo Standard Pack for $6 is a lower priority than flush support. The Tarot Merchant Voucher for $10 is tempting, but my primary scaling is going to be via Planet cards from Celestial packs, and Tarot cards help thin the deck or enhance cards. The Telescope voucher is doing that job.\n\nThe Spectral Pack is often game-defining, especially with my focus on The Tribe. And if I get a legendary joker, I might have to sell something.\n\nSo, I'm going to take the Spectral Pack, it's the right play. I'll need $4, so my money will be at $16. Then I will reassess.\n\nMy actions:\n\n*   `buy_booster`\n*   `positions`: \\[1]\n\nAnd, double-checking, I have enough money, and Telescope means Celestial packs are what I should be looking for. After this, let's see. Maybe I'll grab a Tarot Merchant Voucher after all.\n\n*   `action`: \"buy_booster\"\n*   `positions`: \\[1]\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
