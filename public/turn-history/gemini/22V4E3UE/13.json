I just skipped the Big Blind to pick up a Rare Tag, so now I'm facing the Boss Blind screen. My current hand is:\\n\\nI've got the Zany Joker in play, which is crucial. It gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind or better. I have $6 in money, and the Rare Tag is ready for the next shop. The upcoming boss is \\\"The Head,\\\" which debuffs all Heart cards. The target is 600 chips to clear the blind.\\n\\nMy main goal is to reach 600 chips, and the Zany Joker is going to make this very straightforward. A Level 1 Three of a Kind gets me 30 chips with a 3x Mult. With Zany, that Mult jumps to 15. So, if I get, say, a Three of a Kind with three low cards like three 3s (non-Hearts), that's 30 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 39 chips. Multiplying by 15, that's 585! I'm almost there just with a very basic 3OAK, a Pair plus a high card will easily push me over the threshold and a Full House will smash the target.\\n\\nThe Heart card debuff means Hearts cards are essentially dead weight, but they still count towards making the hand, so I should just make sure my scoring cards aren't hearts.\\n\\nSo, here's the plan: Since I skipped the Big Blind, I *have* to play the Boss Blind now. I need to make use of the Zany Joker to get to the shop where the Rare Tag triggers.\\n\\nI have no consumables to use or sell. I only have one Joker, so rearranging or selling is pointless. The obvious next action is: \\\"play_round\\\" \\u2013 let's do this.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play_round\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 12]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

I've got my Zany Joker, which is key - it gives a +12 Multiplier if I can get a Three of a Kind or better. Also, I have a Rare Tag.  My current cash is a paltry $6.\\n\\nLooking at my hand: Jack of Spades, 10 of Spades, 4 of Spades, 2 of Hearts (useless in this scenario, as debuffed), 9 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, King of Diamonds. Pure garbage right now, no pairs, no nothing. Highest scoring potential is High Card Ace. I've got four discards left, and four hands.\\n\\nMy primary goal here is to trigger that Zany Joker. I need at least a Three of a Kind. The 2 of Hearts is dead to me right now given the debuff.\\n\\nMy strategy here is pretty simple: get rid of the dregs and fish for what I need. I'm discarding the 4 of Spades, 2 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, and 6 of Clubs. Those cards are unlikely to help me make a hand. If I discard those four cards, I'll get four new ones.\\n\\nI've got 44 cards left in the deck. There are plenty of opportunities for pairs or triples.\\n\\nI'm thinking about discarding the 10 of Spades as well, but no, that's a high card, let's keep it.  The idea here is to dig deep for a 3OAK to activate the joker.\\n\\nJust checking the joker's description: it says \\\"+12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\\\". That includes 3 of a kind, full house, 4 of a kind, and even a 5 of a kind.\\n\\nAlright, discard positions 3, 4, 5, and 6. Standard move, dig for the goods. Let's discard the 4 lowest/debuffed cards: [3, 4, 5, 6].\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 3 4 5 6\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 13]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

I'm in Ante 1, Round 2. The Head boss has the Hearts debuff active, which is relevant, but secondary to the primary goal: reaching 600 chips. Right now, I have the Zany Joker in play, which gives a huge +12 Mult bonus if I can get a 3 of a Kind (3OAK) or better. I need to maximize its potential.\\n\\nLooking at my hand, I see some options. I have a King of Spades, a Jack of Spades, a 10 of Spades, a 7 of Spades, a 3 of Clubs, an Ace of Diamonds, a King of Diamonds, and a 10 of Diamonds. That gives me a pair of Kings and a pair of 10s. No 3OAK just yet, but that's what I'm aiming for. I only have 3 discards though, so choices need to be efficient!\\n\\nClearly, the Zany Joker wants a 3OAK, and since I have pairs of Kings and 10s, that's what I'm going for. I'm going to discard the Jack, the 7, the 3, and the Ace. I can't keep every card, and those contribute least to my goal. The Jack, 7, 3, and Ace have to go.\\n\\nNow I need to assess the risk vs reward. If I get a 3OAK, it's worth a lot. Let's see... a 3OAK has a base of 30 chips with a mult of 3. My Zany Joker adds +12 mult, which is huge, and brings that base mult to 15. To hit 600 chips, I need to get at least 40 chips in that hand: *Chips * 15 >= 600* is the equation. If I hit a 3OAK of 10s, that's 30 + 10 + 10 + 10 for 60 chips, and at a mult of 15, I get 900 chips. Win.\\n\\nIf I get Two Pair, Kings and 10s: That's only 20 chips at a mult of 2. I would have 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 chips. That's only 120 Chips with Two Pairs. That's not enough to win, and I really need that 3OAK.\\n\\nSo, the optimal play here is to discard those cards that don't help me get a 3OAK.\\n\\nLet's check the deck odds: I still have a decent chance. There are two Kings and two 10s remaining in the deck. I need to discard the Jack, 7, 3, and Ace to have a better chance of hitting that 3OAK. Here's hoping the RNG gods are with me! Let's do it!\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 2 4 5 6\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

  "reasoning": "**My Poker Decision: Full House for the Win**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 2, with the ante at 1/8. This is the hand-selection phase, and that blind, \"Boss (The Head),\" is playing nasty, debuffing all Heart cards. That's relevant; I need to keep that in mind. My target is 600 chips, and I have $6.00 to play with. I also have the Zany Joker, which is going to be crucial here. It gives me a +12 Mult bonus if I play a hand with a Three of a Kind. I have 4 hands remaining and 2 discards.\n\nLet's see what I'm working with: a King of Spades (+10), a 10 of Spades (+10), a debuffed King of Hearts (0), a debuffed 9 of Hearts (no dice), a 2 of Clubs (+2), a King of Diamonds (+10), a 10 of Diamonds (+10), and a 7 of Diamonds (+7).\n\nI can form a Three of a Kind with the Kings (KS, KH, KD), but the King of Hearts being debuffed is a big consideration; it still contributes to the hand type but scores 0. I can also build a Two Pair (Kings and 10s). But the clear winner is a Full House! Kings (KS, KH, KD) and 10s (10S, 10D).\n\nThe Zany Joker is definitely going to work for me because both the Full House and Three of a Kind hand contain a three of a kind.\n\nI calculated the Full House: King of Spades (10), King of Hearts (0), King of Diamonds (10), 10 of Spades (10), and 10 of Diamonds (10). The cards score 40 chips in total. Then I have the Base Mult of 4, the card chips which are at 40, and the Zany bonus of 12 for the Three of a Kind. That gets me 80 * 16 = 1280 total chips! I'm easily over the 600 target. The Full House is the safer play, guaranteeing the win. The King of Hearts being debuffed is already factored into the calculation.\n\nEven if I played the Three of a Kind I would easily win but the Full House is the safest.\n\nI need to confirm the positions: Card positions are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.\n\nSo, the play is a \"play\" action, the positions are [1, 2, 3, 6, 7], and the hand type is \"full house\". I estimate 1280 chips. This is a very good hand, and I'll go for it. I should easily be able to move to the shop and get my Rare Joker after this.\n\nLet me just double-check one more time...\n\nCards again: King of Spades, 10 of Spades, King of Hearts (Debuffed), King of Diamonds, 10 of Diamonds. Okay, I'm ready.\n\nAction: \"play\"\nPositions: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]\nHand: \"full house\"\nChips: 1280.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\n"
