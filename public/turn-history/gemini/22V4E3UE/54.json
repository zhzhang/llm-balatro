{"reasoning":"**Optimal Play: Flush for Massive Chips**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Boss Blind in Round 6, with only four hands left. I need to hit 4,000 chips, and I have none right now. The good news is, I have a fantastic hand setup for a Flush, and the Jokers are perfectly aligned for a massive score.\n\nLet's break it down. I have Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, The Tribe, and Turtle Bean in play, along with the Gift Card. I have a solid Flush in Spades with the Ace, King, Queen, 10, and 3. The Abstract Joker is giving me +15 Multiplier per joker. The Tribe doubles my Flush multiplier. Turtle Bean is handy.\n\nMy goal is to reach 4,000 chips. I will get it with this play.\n\nI've got a Flush that's ready to go. Focusing on the best cards with Odd Todd, I'll play the Ace, King, Queen, 10, and 3 of Spades. The Ace and 3 will trigger Odd Todd's bonus, giving me an extra 62 chips. The base flush score is 65 chips, and those cards are worth an extra 44 chips, for a total of 171 chips.\n\nThe Flush's base multiplier is 8. The Abstract Joker adds +15 Multiplier per Joker, bringing me to a total Multiplier of 23. This will then be doubled by The Tribe to 46.\n\nSo, 171 chips * 46 multiplier is a massive 7,866 chips. This is well above what I need.\n\nSo, I'm setting up to play a \"flush\" with cards in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, which are the Ace, King, Queen, 10, and 3 of Spades, in that order. This should net me about 7,866 chips. Time to execute this play!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,6]"}
