{"reasoning":"**Round Decision: Ante 4 - Big Blind Dilemma**\n\nOkay, here we are at the `BLIND_SELECT` phase of Ante 4. I've got a tight $5, facing a 7500 chip Big Blind. The reward for playing is $4, which is a big deal right now, along with the interest and the Gift Card scaling. That Gift Card is going to be worth something by the end of this run. Skipping gives me a D6 tag for free rerolls in the next shop, but that shop visit is probably more important right now, to search for those essential Planet cards.\n\nI'm running a Flush build, and it's been consistently hitting over 7500 chips, so I'm confident in the build's power. Thinking back to the last hand, I earned over 10,000 chips using a Flush. That should easily cover the blind.\n\nThe core of the strategy is the shop visit after playing. I need to find Planet cards, specifically Jupiter, because of the Telescope Voucher guarantee. I'm currently holding *The Hierophant* consumable. Is this the right time to use it? Can I even target cards with it in this phase? A quick look at the available actions reveals `use_consumable` is an available command, so it's possible. However, Hierophant needs target cards from a hand, and I don't have a hand yet. I have to select `play_round` first.\n\nThe boss, The Pillar, adds a small challenge with the first card face down. It makes it a bit harder to set up the first Flush, but I have four hands and three discards, which is a good chance to form it.\n\nOne final thought: Let's quickly review the Joker order. It’s a standard lineup: Odd Todd for chips, Abstract Joker for mult, Turtle Bean to reduce every round (it can't be helped), The Tribe for X2 mult, Gift Card for more scaling, and Acrobat for X3 mult. The order looks optimal, and I don't need to shuffle anything.\n\nOkay, the decision is clear. I’m playing this round. Action: `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
