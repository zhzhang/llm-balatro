{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante 2 Shop: A Focused Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2, Round 3, $11 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Zany (3 of a Kind multiplier), The Tribe (Flush multiplier), Odd Todd (odd card chips), and Abstract (Joker multiplier). I'm running 4/5 Jokers, so that's good. My hand levels are Flush 2 and Full House 2. The immediate goal is to fortify this deck to beat The Pillar.\n\nThe shop is offering some interesting choices, and I need to prioritize carefully. I just snagged the Abstract Joker, and now I'm looking at my options. I'm thinking... The Celestial Pack ($4) is incredibly appealing. Leveling up Flush or Full House *directly* boosts the base chips and mult, which then gets amplified by The Tribe (for Flush) or added to by Abstract/Zany. The Jumbo Standard ($6) is solid for specific cards, but I need consistency for the boss. The Turtle Bean ($6) is tempting for the extra hand size, but it's temporary and eats into my interest, so probably not. The Crystal Ball ($10) is out of the question – too expensive, especially when I can earn interest. Finally, rerolling the shop for $5 is not worth it at this stage.\n\nMy thinking right now: The Celestial Pack is the clear frontrunner. I should buy that, no question. It's a bargain for the direct hand scaling. Even after the purchase, I'll still have $7. I'll maintain my $1 interest. I could be tempted to then buy the Jumbo Standard Pack and drop to $1, but the loss of interest at that point could be a mistake unless the Celestial pack gives me an obvious reason to buy it.\n\nTherefore, the action is going to be `buy_booster 2` – the Celestial Pack. It lines up perfectly with my strategy of enhancing the hands that are currently supported by my Jokers. The cost is $4, reducing my funds to $7, but keeping me above the $5 threshold for interest. This plan should work.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
