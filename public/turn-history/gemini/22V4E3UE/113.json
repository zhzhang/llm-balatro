{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Decision-Making for the Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6, Round 12. $33 in the bank. I've got a solid Joker lineup: Odd Todd for chips, Abstract Joker for mult, To the Moon for interest, Gift Card for sell value (and an extra Joker slot, which is important here), The Tribe for Flush multiplier, and Acrobat for the end-hand multiplier. I'm rocking a Flush build, currently level 5.\n\nI need to make the most of this shop phase. I have one Jupiter in my inventory, thanks to the 6 of Spades effect, and I need to level up my flush!\n\nFirst, let's confirm the Joker slot situation. With the Gift Card (Negative), I should have one slot free given the max is six jokers. Seems good.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Walkie Talkie isn't ideal for this Flush-focused strategy. Riff-Raff *could* be interesting to get sell value from Gift Card, but it's a bit slow, so I'll put it aside for now. Celestial Packs are interesting given I have the Telescope voucher! And the Hone Voucher could be a solid investment for late game scaling.\n\nMy initial plan is clear: **Use the Jupiter consumable to level up the Flush**.\n\nThe current plan is to use Jupiter immediately to level up the Flush and then buy the Celestial Packs. This approach seems the most efficient given that I have the Telescope Voucher guaranteeing Planet card in my packs. I think, since the Jupiter is already in my inventory, I can use it without buying anything first.\n\nJupiter costs zero.\nCelestial Pack ($4) + Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6) = $10.\nHone ($10)\nTotal spent = $20.\nRemaining = $13.\n\nNow, let's generate the action.\n\nMy current action: Use Jupiter.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
