{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Selection: Ante 2, Round 2**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. I'm in the shop, Ante 2, Round 2. I've got $11. My hand currently features the Zany Joker (+12 Mult for 3OAK), The Tribe (x2 Mult for Flush), and Odd Todd (+31 Chips for odd rank cards). I'm sitting on three Joker slots filled and have no consumables. My goal is to maximize my ability to beat this Ante.\n\nLooking at the shop, I've got the Business Card ($4), a Celestial Pack ($4), the Crystal Ball ($10), and a $5 reroll option. The Crystal Ball is out of the question; it'll leave me broke. Rerolling is too risky right now.\n\nThe Business Card is tempting because it gives me more money when I use face cards, but with $11, I'm already in a decent spot, and I value permanent scaling more.\n\nThe Celestial Pack is where it's at for me. It could help me level up my Flush or 3OAK, which is crucial for long-term consistency. Currently, all my hand levels are at level 1. If I skip buying it, I will end up with $13 at the end of the round.\n\nMy immediate strategic thought is that since I have Odd Todd, Zany Joker, and The Tribe, the Celestial Pack is probably higher value. I could end up with a level up on one of the hands and that would be worth the $1 interest loss. Since my hand levels are all 1, I need to get one of them to scale.\n\nGiven that I'm on a tight budget, but I also have the Celestial Pack (1), I'm making the following action: `buy_booster 1`. This is because permanent scaling is a high value.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
