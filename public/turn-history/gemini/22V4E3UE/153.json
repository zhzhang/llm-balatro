{"reasoning":"**The Game Plan: Heart Flush or Bust**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Big Blind is looming, I'm at zero chips, and it's Round 16. I've got a bit of money ($31), a few hands left, and a deck of cards to work with. My primary goal, given the hand I've been dealt, is to hit a Flush, specifically a Heart Flush. \"The Tribe\" card gives a 2x multiplier to Flushes, and the Flush is already at level 8, so it's the obvious play.\n\nI need 52,500 chips to meet the blind, and I have a few cards in my hand already that could work with the flush. I've got two Steel Aces (one of which is a Heart, the other a Club - the Steel multiplier will definitely come in handy) and a couple of other Hearts, a 9 and a 6. I know keeping the Steel Aces in hand provides the best multiplier overall, so I am going to keep them.\n\nMy first thought is to discard any cards that aren't Hearts. The Ace of Spades, the 9 of Diamonds, and the 4 of Diamonds are the obvious choices. They're junk for a Flush. I have 4 discards, so I can be aggressive. I need to keep the 2 Steel Aces (one is a Heart, and one is a Club) to get the most multi, and get two more Hearts.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking of discarding the Ace of Spades, 9 of Diamonds, and 4 of Diamonds. But then I check if keeping all four Hearts is better. I can still use the discard. So I decide to discard the non-Hearts.\n\nThere's the question of whether I should discard all three cards (Ace Spades, 9 Diamonds, 4 Diamonds) to give me a chance to find the Hearts I need.\n\nAnd then there's the other question, how many Hearts do I need? A Heart Flush would include 5 Hearts, right? I am holding a Steel Ace of Hearts, the 9 of Hearts, and the 6 of Hearts already. If I discard the other cards, there are 15 Hearts. So I need to discard the non-Hearts and hunt for two more Hearts.\n\nAnd if I do hit the Heart Flush, even with a few odd cards, I should be able to get a significant score boost from Odd Todd, To the Moon, and the Steel Ace multiplier. A heart flush (with a Steel Ace) *should* be enough to get the chip total I need.\n\nSo, the play is clear: I'm going to discard the Ace of Spades, the 9 of Diamonds, and the 4 of Diamonds. Let's dig for those Hearts!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,6,7]"}
