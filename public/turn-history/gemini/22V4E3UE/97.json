{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis - Ante 5, Round 10: Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop phase of Round 10 with $14. I've got a solid Joker setup: Odd Todd for chips, Abstract for mult, To the Moon for that sweet, sweet extra interest (currently $2 extra, making it $4 total), Gift Card for a free slot (although it decreases sell value, that's fine with the value it is already), The Tribe for flush multipliers, and Acrobat for the final hand. I've got a \"Death\" consumable, but can't use it now. My Flush hand is at Level 5 with good chip and mult bonuses. The Telescope voucher is ready, and a Magic Trick Voucher is in the shop.\n\nMy options in the shop are Rocket for $6, which adds $1 at the end of round, increasing by $2 for each boss. I have a full Joker slot, so I'd need to sell one. The Green Joker is available for $4. It gives a mult bonus per hand played, but a negative mult per discard. The magic trick is $10. Not worth it now. I can also reroll for $5.\n\nLet's break this down. The build is strong for Ante 5. *Odd Todd*, *Abstract*, *To the Moon*, *Gift Card*, *The Tribe*, and *Acrobat* are a powerful core. Rocket is great long-term, but with only three Boss Blinds remaining, the payout would only increase to $7, making it a questionable replacement at this stage.\n\nConsidering my cash, saving for interest seems the most prudent move. I'm currently at $14, which, with \"To the Moon\", gives me $4 interest. Getting to $15 would give me a significant boost to $6 total interest.\n\nI've already used the boosters and planet cards. The shop cards are not an improvement over my current jokers. The Magic Trick voucher is a low priority. Reroll is out of the question as it costs $5. It would drop my interest by $2.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to proceed to the next round, maintain the interest streak, and accumulate more money. I'm going to take the action `round_select` and move on.\n\nWait, before I commit, let me double-check that interest calculation one more time. Interest is $1 per $5. I have $14, so that's 2, plus an extra $1 for \"To the Moon\" for every $5. So, for $10-$14, I get $2 base + $2 extra = $4 total. At $15, that becomes $3 base + $3 extra = $6. Buying something costing $4 or more will drop me significantly, so saving is better. Rocket is $6, which would reduce me to $8, giving $1 base + $1 extra = $2 total. Yep, still better to save.\n\nOkay, back to `action`: \"round_select\", with `positions`, `intended_hand_type`, and `estimated_chips` all set to `null` because they aren't relevant for this action. I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct according to the schema. \n\nLet's verify the schema again to make sure. I'm going to set it correctly now.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"round_select\", \"positions\": null, \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
