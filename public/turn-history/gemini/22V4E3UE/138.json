{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Spectral Pack: Aura is the Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 14, Ante 7/8. I've got $38, six Jokers, and a solid Flush build at Level 8. My primary goal right now is to grab the best card from this Spectral Pack.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n*   **Ouija:** Interesting idea. Converts all cards to a single random rank, but permanently reduces hand size. That's a huge risk for my Flush strategy; I need those cards to get the right suits. Could be insane for Five of a Kind, but I'm not running that. Plus, the reduced hand size is a huge negative. Hard pass.\n*   **Aura:** Adds a Foil, Holographic, or Polychrome effect to a card in hand. This is the least risky option, offering a direct, if small, buff. I'm leaning towards this.\n*   **Ectoplasm:** Adds Negative to a random Joker, but also takes away two cards from my hand size. Yikes! That hand size reduction is brutal for a Flush. I need to be able to find the right cards, and losing two is a death sentence. And, actually, since I already have Gift Card, I am at max Jokers anyway. This isn't even worth considering with my build.\n*   **Ankh:** Copies a random Joker, destroying all others. This is the high-variance play. Could be incredible if I copied The Tribe (X2 Multiplier) or Acrobat (X3 on final hand), but losing my other jokers like Abstract (+18) and To the Moon (+10) is a massive risk. I have to calculate the potential payout vs. the current situation. I'd be looking at a max of X4 from two Tribes (18\\*2\\*2=72), whereas I have a baseline of 46 \\* 2 (Tribe) = 92. And I don't want to lose my Odd Todd (+31 for odd ranks). Ankh is way too destructive here.\n\nI'm thinking Aura is the only way to go. There is no major downside, and a direct boost is always welcome. The other choices would likely make me worse, or the benefit is only worth it in very specific scenarios. I want to add Polychrome to a card in my hand to get the x1.5 multiplier.\n\nRight. Time to make a selection. I'll go with `select 2 4`.\n\nI will be adding Polychrome to my 10 of Diamonds, which is in the fourth position.\n\nNope, I am confident in this. Aura is the play.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,4]"}
