{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Decision - Ante 6, Round 12**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 6, round 12, shop phase, $27 in the bank. I need to make the most of this. My Joker setup is pretty strong: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, and Acrobat. I'm flush focused, with a level 7 Flush already. I also have Telescope voucher, which is solid for shop manipulation.\n\nFirst, I used Jupiter, so that's out of the equation.\n\nThe prime target here is the Celestial Pack. Specifically, the \"Jumbo\" Celestial pack is done, so I want to get the regular Celestial Pack. That will continue pushing my flush level. I could also buy the Hone voucher to get a discount later.\n\nThe plan is to:\n\n1.  `buy_booster 1` - the Celestial Pack.\n\nLet's check the money after this: $27 - $4 = $23. Then if I bought Hone, it would be $23 - $10 = $13. To the Moon will give me about $4 interest ($2 per $5).\n\nOkay, so Celestial Pack is a must. The Celestial Pack is the priority. With Telescope, it will be optimized to give me a flush card.\n\nBefore executing, let's quickly re-evaluate the shop cards. Walkie Talkie and Riff-raff. Riff-raff is useless since I have 6/6 Jokers already. Walkie Talkie is also not helpful because my core build doesn't focus on 10s or 4s. So, scratch those.\n\nRight, so the action is clear: Celestial Pack.\n\nI'm ready to execute. I need to buy the Celestial Pack and *use* it immediately, since I'm in the shop.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
