{"reasoning":"**The Calculation of a Winning Flush**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the thick of it – 7500 chips needed to clear this blind. Let's see...I'm in the hand selection phase with four hands left and four discards remaining. Inventory is pretty solid: Odd Todd for odd ranks, Abstract Joker for mult boost, Turtle Bean for a larger hand size, The Tribe for double mult on Flushes, Gift Card (the negative one which opens up an additional joker slot) and Acrobat for a final hand x3 mult. No consumables available this time.\n\nMy current hand looks promising. I have a King of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, 8 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 6 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and 3 of Clubs. A quick glance tells me I can make a Flush with the clubs: King, Queen, 7, 4, and 3.\n\nNow, let's break down the scoring. A base Flush gives me 65 chips with an 8x Mult.  The cards themselves contribute: King and Queen each are worth 40 chips (base + bonus), 7 is worth 7, 4 is worth 4, and 3 is worth 3. Then, Odd Todd kicks in, adding 31 chips each for the 7 and the 3 because those ranks are odd.  This sums up to 221 chips before mults.\n\nFor mult calculation, I get an 8 base, and the Abstract Joker adds a whopping 18 for a total of 26. The Tribe doubles that to 52 because it's a Flush. The Acrobat is sitting there waiting for the final hand but won't apply this round.\n\nSo, the estimated total score for this play comes to 221 * 52 = 11,492.  That's well over the target of 7500, easily clearing the round in a single hand.\n\nI'm playing the cards in positions 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. The intended hand is a flush. The schema checks out - that looks good.\n\nHold on, quick double-check on those Odd Todd ranks. King is rank 13. King and Queen, are technically Even in chips, but Odd in rank. The game lists them: (A, 9, 7, 5, 3). The calculations look correct.\n\nJust one final thought... Does the Abstract Joker count itself and the Gift Card for its mult bonus? Let me see. I have six Jokers in total. Yup! Six Jokers at 3 mult each = 18 mult.\n\nAnd I've got a hand of 8 cards. So, there is a total of five clubs in the hand to be played.\n\nAlright, the final output looks good:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 2, 6, 7, 8],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 11492\n}\n```\n\nLet's do this.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,7,8]"}
