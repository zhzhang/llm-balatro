{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Celestial Pack: A Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, here we go. We're in Round 2, and it's time to choose the second card from the Mega Celestial Pack. I've got $7 and some interesting Jokers: Zany Joker, which is a beast for Three of a Kind, The Tribe for Flushes, and Odd Todd for odd-ranked cards (which could be useful later). My hand levels are decent, a Flush and Full House at level 2 and a Three of a Kind at level 1.\n\nThe booster choices are Mercury (Pairs, not ideal), Neptune (Straight Flush, high ceiling but tough to hit), Mars (Four of a Kind, good synergy with Zany, and easier to get than straight flush), and Uranus (Two Pair, a fallback but not as exciting).\n\nMy immediate focus is building around Flushes (thanks to The Tribe) and Three of a Kind (Zany). Mars levels up a Four of a Kind, which triggers Zany. Neptune levels up Straight Flush, which also benefits from The Tribe. Let's compare the potential. A Straight Flush base score (level 1) is 100 chips/8 mult, a Four of a Kind is 60 chips/7 mult. A Straight Flush would be (100+40) * (8+4) * 2 = 3360 chips. A Four of a Kind would be (60+30) * (7+3+12) = 1980 chips.\n\nI need to focus my strategy:  I've got a Full House focus, and I have The Tribe. Since Straight Flush is essentially a Flush, it gets the X2 from The Tribe. I can play the cards of a 3OAK, a hand I'm already building with Zany.  Mars (4OAK) is much easier to transition into from a Full House. I have Zany so even if the mult is slightly lower, it's easier to hit.\n\nReconsidering... I have the options: Mercury, Neptune, Mars, Uranus. If I'm not planning on playing any of these, it doesn't matter much. Two Pair (Uranus) is a common fall-back. Pair (Mercury) is even more common. Since I have Zany, I want to play hands that contain Three of a Kind. Four of a Kind is a logical choice.\n\nWait, I just realized: Straight Flush benefits from the tribe, but Four of a Kind benefits from Zany. This makes Mars the most logical choice among these that supports my current Joker (Zany). I'm going with Mars, because it's a more realistic \"dream\" hand than Straight Flush right now.\n\nNow, let's double-check the previous turn's logic. Earth, then pack of 5, then now only 4.  Mars is at index 3. I pick Mars to level up the hand.\n\nMars is the choice, I pick it. This is a free upgrade.\n\nLet's do a final check: Zany Joker for Three of a Kind, The Tribe for Flush. Mars levels Four of a Kind which triggers Zany Joker. Okay, and what about Odd Todd? If I get four 7s: (60+30 base + 4*11 rank + 4*31 Odd Todd) * (7+3 base + 12 Zany) = (258) * (22) = 5676. Yeah, it works fine.\n\nMy final action, with all constraints are fine: `\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3]`\nI'll include the intended hand: `\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3], \"intended_hand_type\": \"four of a kind\", \"estimated_chips\": 1980`\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
