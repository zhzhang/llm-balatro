{"reasoning":"**First Round Decision Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 1, Round 0, the very beginning of the game. I have $4, a completely empty inventory, and the Blind structure is set. Currently, I'm at the BLIND_SELECT step. The Small Blind is 300 chips with a $3 reward and a Coupon Tag, the Big Blind is 450 chips with a $4 reward and a Rare Tag, and the Boss Blind is 600 chips with a $5 reward. The Boss Blind debuffs Hearts (The Heart).\n\nMy immediate choice is whether to play or skip the Small Blind. Skipping would give me the Coupon Tag, which makes items and packs in the *next* shop free, but means I skip the first shop altogether and head straight to the Big Blind. The rewards for the blinds are fairly standard.\n\nI could skip, get the Coupon Tag, and have free stuff next shop. The Coupon Tag seems alright, but I usually prefer getting some early money to buy a useful Joker immediately. If I play and win the Small Blind, I get $3 plus potential money for hand rewards. I also access the shop *immediately*. It's likely I can earn ~$8 for the first shop, which lets me get a Joker or some packs.\n\nGenerally, I'd say skipping the first Small Blind for a Coupon Tag is a decent early strategy *if* the tag is high-value. However, playing the Small Blind is safer, and I prefer building up some money to buy something. The Coupon Tag's value is unknown until the shop. Also, I don't know the exact value of the Rare Tag I'd gain after the Big Blind. This means beating 300 chips is a safe bet to begin with.\n\nSo, I will choose to play the round, since that gives me early money to spend at the shop. My action will be `play_round`. I need to generate valid JSON: `{\"action\":\"play_round\",\"positions\":null,\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
