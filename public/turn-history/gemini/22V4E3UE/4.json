I have eight cards in hand, and the goal is to reach that 300 chip target, so let's get efficient here. I can discard up to five cards, which is key. My initial thought is to make a quick play, I want to minimize the number of rounds to maximize the end-of-round bonus.\\n\\nLooking at my hand: Q\\u2660, 3\\u2660, 7\\u2665, 2\\u2663, Q\\u2666, J\\u2666, 10\\u2666, 2\\u2666. Two pairs, the Queens and the 2s, are the obvious starting point. I know these aren't terrible, but a Two Pair will only get me 88 chips which means multiple hands. We can do better than this with 4 discards. I have four diamonds: Q\\u2666, J\\u2666, 10\\u2666, and 2\\u2666. Now that's the key. I know a flush is worth more, 35 chips with a 4x multiplier, and I'm at 200, or more, with multiple high diamonds, for an easy win with one hand.\\n\\nSince I have four discards, let's keep all four diamonds. Discard the ones that don't fit the build. If I am really lucky, I can go higher with more diamonds.\\n\\n**Action: Discarding the Unhelpful Cards**\\n\\nOkay, so I will discard the cards that are *not* diamonds: Q\\u2660, 3\\u2660, 7\\u2665, and 2\\u2663.\\n\\n**The Probability and Strategy Refinement**\\n\\nHere's the thinking: If I have good cards (Q, J, 10, etc.) in my hand, with 4 discards, I have a good chance to draw a Diamond and get that flush. With 62% chance, I have a good starting hand.\\n\\n**The Final Decision**\\n\\nMy final action is to discard the cards that will *not* help my Flush and to keep the diamonds. I just have to write it in JSON format now.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"action\\\": \\\"discard\\\",\\n  \\\"positions\\\": [1, 2, 3, 4],\\n  \\\"intended_hand_type\\\": null,\\n  \\\"estimated_chips\\\": null\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 3]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 7 of Spades.

I've got a decent hand, but I need to make a strategic play. Let's break down the options.\\n\\nMy initial hand contains: 7\\u2660, 4\\u2660, 10\\u2665, 10\\u2663, Q\\u2666, J\\u2666, 10\\u2666, and 2\\u2666. I'm sitting on a three-of-a-kind (the 10s) and four Diamonds. I've got a total of three discards left. The deck only has 40 cards remaining.\\n\\nOption A is the Three-of-a-Kind, which has a 3x multiplier, but it leaves me short. That\\u2019s probably not the best route.\\n\\nOption B is to simply fish for a diamond.\\n\\nOption C is to keep the Three-of-a-Kind and the diamonds. But, if I play the 10s, I lose a Diamond.\\n\\nBut the most compelling play seems to be for the flush with Option D. I'm four cards into a diamond flush, so if I get a fifth diamond, I'm looking at a base of 35 chips with a 4x multiplier. I've got a roughly 66% chance of hitting that flush. With the current cards, the flush would give me 39 total chips. That gets me 296, which is very close to 300. It is a calculated risk, but a risk I'm willing to take.\\n\\nI have 9 diamonds left in the deck, including an Ace, King, 9, 8, and 7. I only need 8 or higher to pass the 300 chip threshold.\\n\\nSo, I need to discard the non-diamond cards, which are 7\\u2660, 4\\u2660, 10\\u2665, and 10\\u2663. My action is to `discard` these in positions `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The goal is to get a diamond flush and aim for the quick win.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 3 of Hearts.

My primary goal is to hit 300 chips in this first round as the small blind. I've got a Flush in my hand with Diamonds. Currently, I have 72 chips with a base multiplier of 4, netting me 288 chips. I'm just short of the 300-chip target. I have two discards remaining, which offers a great opportunity to improve my hand.\\n\\nI'm holding the Q\\u2666, J\\u2666, 10\\u2666, 5\\u2666, and 2\\u2666 \\u2013 a Diamond Flush. The value of these cards is a bit low. I've calculated that I'm 12 chips shy of my goal. I've got 8 Diamonds remaining in the deck. I can discard the lower-value Diamonds (5\\u2666 and 2\\u2666) along with the non-diamond cards (3\\u2665, A\\u2663, 7\\u2663) to try for higher diamonds. That gives me a good chance of significantly boosting my score.\\n\\nIf I replace the 5\\u2666 and 2\\u2666 with higher Diamonds, like a K\\u2666 and 9\\u2666, my score jumps up to 336 chips, comfortably exceeding my goal. Even if I don't get the perfect draw, any two diamonds that add up to 3 or more chips will be more than the initial hands. The odds of drawing at least one viable diamond are very high. So, the smart move is to discard the non-diamonds and the lower diamonds.\\n\\nI have 3 hands remaining, meaning that I need to weigh the potential reward of winning on one hand, versus two. If I can nail the winning hand now, with a discard, then I receive more cash ($4 + $1(interest) + $3(reward) + $3(hands) = $11 total), versus if I don't discard ($4 + $1(interest) + $3(reward) + $2(hands) = $10 total). The small difference makes this a clear choice.\\n\\nTherefore, I'll execute the discard, targeting positions 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8, keeping the Q\\u2666, J\\u2666, and 10\\u2666. This should get me the extra 12 chips I need, and allow me to hit the 300 target. I've double-checked the math, and this is the highest probability play to maximize my return.

You may play up to 5 cards at a time.

  "reasoning": "**My Strategic Analysis: Round 1 Flush Attempt**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante is 1/8, and I'm aiming for 300 chips. I have $4, four hands left, and one discard remaining. Inventory is clean, no Jokers or consumables to speak of. My hand currently holds: 2 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, 10 of Diamonds, and 8 of Diamonds.\n\nThe immediate goal is obvious: I'm staring at a potential flush. I've got four diamonds (Q, J, 10, 8) with a total of 38 chip rank. The Level 1 Flush is worth 35 chips with a 4x multiplier. To hit 300 chips, I need to make the calculation: (35 + card\\_chips) * 4 >= 300, which means card\\_chips needs to be at least 40. I'm already at 38, so I only need two more chips. This indicates any diamond will achieve my goal. The current deck contains 7 diamonds.\n\nTo maximize my chance of hitting the flush, I'll be discarding the non-diamonds: 2 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, and 4 of Clubs, leaving me with the four diamonds. This will leave me with a 67% chance to draw at least one diamond and complete my flush. If I do draw a diamond, the lowest one I can get is a 2, which will get me exactly 300 chips. Even if I don't draw a diamond, I still have four hands left. I can play a high card or pair and discard/play again.\n\nI ran through the calculations again to be sure: (35 + 38 + rank) * 4 = 300. So I'm covered.\n\nNow, let's verify positions.\nPositions to discard:\n1: 2 of Spades\n2: Ace of Hearts\n3: Queen of Clubs\n4: 4 of Clubs\n\nPositions to keep:\n5: Queen of Diamonds\n6: Jack of Diamonds\n7: 10 of Diamonds\n8: 8 of Diamonds\n\nThere are no better hands available than the Flush.\n\nThe final action is to discard cards in positions \\[1, 2, 3, 4] and hope to hit the Flush.\n\n\n"
