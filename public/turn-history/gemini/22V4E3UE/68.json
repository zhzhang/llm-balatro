{"reasoning":"**Okay, here's the game plan, laid out like a blueprint.**\n\nI'm in Round 8, the Big Blind, and I need 7500 chips to win, but I'm sitting pretty with my current hand – or, I *will* be, in a moment. I've got a killer Flush in the making, and I've got to play it smart to optimize the situation for this round and the ones to follow.\n\nI'm eyeing this hand: a potential Flush with the King, Queen, 7, 4, and 3 of Clubs. My initial calculation shows that with the Jokers I have, I'm easily going to win with a score well above 7500 – around 25,116 chips! But here's where the strategy kicks in. I see \"The Hierophant,\" my consumable, and it's calling to me, screaming \"Deck improvement!\"\n\nI've got the \"Gift Card\" Joker which gives +$1 sell value. If I'm honest, $1 sell value isn't going to make or break anything. I have $5, and will have $13 to start the next round! My brain is locked on the main prize, and I'm ready to use this Hierophant on the King and Queen of Clubs. Now they're no longer just strong cards, but super-powered Bonus Cards!\n\nShould I focus on an instant win or strategic deck improvement? The expert in me says deck improvement. My current hand is a winning hand, so I might as well *enhance* my cards for an even better future.\n\nHere's the final plan. I'll deploy \"The Hierophant\" now, on the King of Clubs (position 4) and the Queen of Clubs (position 5). Now, those two cards are turned into Bonus Cards, and then I'll play the flush. This boosts my score *this* round *and* makes the deck more powerful!\n\nHere's the JSON command I'm using, since I'm pretty sure that's what I am expected to return here, or at least the most useful thing:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 4, 5]\n}\n```\n\nWait, before I commit! Let me double-check the order: Consumable position, then the two cards I am selecting. Yes, that's what's needed.\n\nOkay, here we go! With that, I'm confident in my decision.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,4,5]"}
