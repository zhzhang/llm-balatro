I've got a decent hand, but I need to make a strategic play. Let's break down the options.\\n\\nMy initial hand contains: 7\\u2660, 4\\u2660, 10\\u2665, 10\\u2663, Q\\u2666, J\\u2666, 10\\u2666, and 2\\u2666. I'm sitting on a three-of-a-kind (the 10s) and four Diamonds. I've got a total of three discards left. The deck only has 40 cards remaining.\\n\\nOption A is the Three-of-a-Kind, which has a 3x multiplier, but it leaves me short. That\\u2019s probably not the best route.\\n\\nOption B is to simply fish for a diamond.\\n\\nOption C is to keep the Three-of-a-Kind and the diamonds. But, if I play the 10s, I lose a Diamond.\\n\\nBut the most compelling play seems to be for the flush with Option D. I'm four cards into a diamond flush, so if I get a fifth diamond, I'm looking at a base of 35 chips with a 4x multiplier. I've got a roughly 66% chance of hitting that flush. With the current cards, the flush would give me 39 total chips. That gets me 296, which is very close to 300. It is a calculated risk, but a risk I'm willing to take.\\n\\nI have 9 diamonds left in the deck, including an Ace, King, 9, 8, and 7. I only need 8 or higher to pass the 300 chip threshold.\\n\\nSo, I need to discard the non-diamond cards, which are 7\\u2660, 4\\u2660, 10\\u2665, and 10\\u2663. My action is to `discard` these in positions `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The goal is to get a diamond flush and aim for the quick win.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 3 of Hearts.

My primary goal is to hit 300 chips in this first round as the small blind. I've got a Flush in my hand with Diamonds. Currently, I have 72 chips with a base multiplier of 4, netting me 288 chips. I'm just short of the 300-chip target. I have two discards remaining, which offers a great opportunity to improve my hand.\\n\\nI'm holding the Q\\u2666, J\\u2666, 10\\u2666, 5\\u2666, and 2\\u2666 \\u2013 a Diamond Flush. The value of these cards is a bit low. I've calculated that I'm 12 chips shy of my goal. I've got 8 Diamonds remaining in the deck. I can discard the lower-value Diamonds (5\\u2666 and 2\\u2666) along with the non-diamond cards (3\\u2665, A\\u2663, 7\\u2663) to try for higher diamonds. That gives me a good chance of significantly boosting my score.\\n\\nIf I replace the 5\\u2666 and 2\\u2666 with higher Diamonds, like a K\\u2666 and 9\\u2666, my score jumps up to 336 chips, comfortably exceeding my goal. Even if I don't get the perfect draw, any two diamonds that add up to 3 or more chips will be more than the initial hands. The odds of drawing at least one viable diamond are very high. So, the smart move is to discard the non-diamonds and the lower diamonds.\\n\\nI have 3 hands remaining, meaning that I need to weigh the potential reward of winning on one hand, versus two. If I can nail the winning hand now, with a discard, then I receive more cash ($4 + $1(interest) + $3(reward) + $3(hands) = $11 total), versus if I don't discard ($4 + $1(interest) + $3(reward) + $2(hands) = $10 total). The small difference makes this a clear choice.\\n\\nTherefore, I'll execute the discard, targeting positions 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8, keeping the Q\\u2666, J\\u2666, and 10\\u2666. This should get me the extra 12 chips I need, and allow me to hit the 300 target. I've double-checked the math, and this is the highest probability play to maximize my return. Let's do it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 5]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 2 of Spades.

I have $4, four hands left, and one discard remaining. Inventory is clean, no Jokers or consumables to speak of. My hand currently holds: 2 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, 10 of Diamonds, and 8 of Diamonds.\\n\\nThe immediate goal is obvious: I'm staring at a potential flush. I've got four diamonds (Q, J, 10, 8) with a total of 38 chip rank. The Level 1 Flush is worth 35 chips with a 4x multiplier. To hit 300 chips, I need to make the calculation: (35 + card\\\\_chips) * 4 >= 300, which means card\\\\_chips needs to be at least 40. I'm already at 38, so I only need two more chips. This indicates any diamond will achieve my goal. The current deck contains 7 diamonds.\\n\\nTo maximize my chance of hitting the flush, I'll be discarding the non-diamonds: 2 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, and 4 of Clubs, leaving me with the four diamonds. This will leave me with a 67% chance to draw at least one diamond and complete my flush. If I do draw a diamond, the lowest one I can get is a 2, which will get me exactly 300 chips. Even if I don't draw a diamond, I still have four hands left. I can play a high card or pair and discard/play again.\\n\\nI ran through the calculations again to be sure: (35 + 38 + rank) * 4 = 300. So I'm covered.\\n\\nNow, let's verify positions.\\nPositions to discard:\\n1: 2 of Spades\\n2: Ace of Hearts\\n3: Queen of Clubs\\n4: 4 of Clubs\\n\\nPositions to keep:\\n5: Queen of Diamonds\\n6: Jack of Diamonds\\n7: 10 of Diamonds\\n8: 8 of Diamonds\\n\\nThere are no better hands available than the Flush.\\n\\nThe final action is to discard cards in positions \\\\[1, 2, 3, 4] and hope to hit the Flush.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Ace of Spades.

  "reasoning": "**Round 1: Full House Analysis**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 1/8, Round 1. We need 300 chips, and I have zero. I have $4, and 4 hands remaining. No Jokers or consumables, and I'm out of discards. This should be interesting. Let's see what we've got.\n\nThe hand I'm dealt is: Ace of Spades, 8 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, 10 of Diamonds, and 8 of Diamonds. It's too bad I missed drawing a fifth diamond during the discard, but that's in the past.\n\nMy options jump out quickly: I can go for Three-of-a-Kind with the 8s, or the Jacks. I could go for Two Pair with the Jacks and 8s. A High Card of Ace of Spades is also an option, but that's not going to cut it. Wait... let me see if I can get a straight. Nope.\n\nAha! There it is, the Full House: Three 8s and two Jacks. Let's confirm: 8 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, 8 of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs, and Jack of Diamonds.\n\nThe base chip value for a Full House at this level is 40 with a multiplier of 4. Now, let's calculate the total chip value: 8 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 10 = 44. The total chip count will be (40 + 44) * 4 = 336.\n\nThat clears the 300 chip requirement. I need to make sure this is the *best* play though. Three-of-a-Kind with the 8s would only be (30 + 24) * 3 = 162. Two Pair with Jacks and 8s would get us (20 + 36) * 2 = 112. Nope, Full House is definitely the best option here.\n\nOkay, 336 is greater than or equal to 300, so we're good. Full House it is.\n\nJust to be safe, I need to double-check my hand type is correct. The cards I need are: 8 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, and 8 of Diamonds. Yup, that's a Full House: Three 8s and two Jacks. The total card chip count: 8+8+10+10+8 = 44. Base: 40 chips, 4 multiplier, so (40 + 44) * 4 = 336.\n\nLet's do a quick comparison to see if there's any weird order, de-buff, or blind effects. I have none. I'm not using any inventory items. There are no hand level debuffs. Everything seems correct.\n\nOne more sanity check on the positions: 1: A-S, 2: 8-S, 3: 8-H, 4: J-C, 5: Q-D, 6: J-D, 7: 10-D, 8: 8-D. So positions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8. Correct.\n\nOkay, let's be absolutely certain here. I need to play the three 8s and the two Jacks. There are only two Jacks (4, 6), so that is fixed. I need three 8s (2, 3, 8), so that is also fixed. The selection is [2, 3, 4, 6, 8].\n\nOne last check: Full House - Three of a kind (8, 8, 8), and a pair (J, J). Check.\n\nChip requirement? 300. Estimated chips? 336. Check.\n\nTime to construct that JSON and submit this hand: {\"action\": \"play\", \"positions\": [2, 3, 4, 6, 8], \"intended_hand_type\": \"full house\", \"estimated_chips\": 336}. Done.\n\n\n"
