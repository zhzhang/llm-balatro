{"reasoning":"**Round 1: Full House Analysis**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 1/8, Round 1. We need 300 chips, and I have zero. I have $4, and 4 hands remaining. No Jokers or consumables, and I'm out of discards. This should be interesting. Let's see what we've got.\n\nThe hand I'm dealt is: Ace of Spades, 8 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, 10 of Diamonds, and 8 of Diamonds. It's too bad I missed drawing a fifth diamond during the discard, but that's in the past.\n\nMy options jump out quickly: I can go for Three-of-a-Kind with the 8s, or the Jacks. I could go for Two Pair with the Jacks and 8s. A High Card of Ace of Spades is also an option, but that's not going to cut it. Wait... let me see if I can get a straight. Nope.\n\nAha! There it is, the Full House: Three 8s and two Jacks. Let's confirm: 8 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, 8 of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs, and Jack of Diamonds.\n\nThe base chip value for a Full House at this level is 40 with a multiplier of 4. Now, let's calculate the total chip value: 8 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 10 = 44. The total chip count will be (40 + 44) * 4 = 336.\n\nThat clears the 300 chip requirement. I need to make sure this is the *best* play though. Three-of-a-Kind with the 8s would only be (30 + 24) * 3 = 162. Two Pair with Jacks and 8s would get us (20 + 36) * 2 = 112. Nope, Full House is definitely the best option here.\n\nOkay, 336 is greater than or equal to 300, so we're good. Full House it is.\n\nJust to be safe, I need to double-check my hand type is correct. The cards I need are: 8 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, and 8 of Diamonds. Yup, that's a Full House: Three 8s and two Jacks. The total card chip count: 8+8+10+10+8 = 44. Base: 40 chips, 4 multiplier, so (40 + 44) * 4 = 336.\n\nLet's do a quick comparison to see if there's any weird order, de-buff, or blind effects. I have none. I'm not using any inventory items. There are no hand level debuffs. Everything seems correct.\n\nOne more sanity check on the positions: 1: A-S, 2: 8-S, 3: 8-H, 4: J-C, 5: Q-D, 6: J-D, 7: 10-D, 8: 8-D. So positions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8. Correct.\n\nOkay, let's be absolutely certain here. I need to play the three 8s and the two Jacks. There are only two Jacks (4, 6), so that is fixed. I need three 8s (2, 3, 8), so that is also fixed. The selection is [2, 3, 4, 6, 8].\n\nOne last check: Full House - Three of a kind (8, 8, 8), and a pair (J, J). Check.\n\nChip requirement? 300. Estimated chips? 336. Check.\n\nTime to construct that JSON and submit this hand: {\"action\": \"play\", \"positions\": [2, 3, 4, 6, 8], \"intended_hand_type\": \"full house\", \"estimated_chips\": 336}. Done.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,8]"}
