{"reasoning":"**Current Round Decision: Reroll for Value**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 4, and I've got $16. The name of the game is Flushes, baby! My current hand size is a bit wonky thanks to that Ectoplasm, but the Turtle Bean is still kicking, even if it's on the decay. My core strategy right now is built around Flushes and my Jokers reflect that: Odd Todd for the chips, Abstract for the base Multiplier, The Tribe for the x2 Multiplier on Flushes, and the Gift Card for future scaling. I also have a lot of interest in Jupiter cards (due to Telescope) and any good Tarots (spades!).\n\nI'm staring at this shop. The Sly Joker and Square Joker are useless, so skip. That Jumbo Standard Pack could have some helpful cards, maybe some Spades, Hearts or Clubs... but it's not a priority. The Tarot Merchant Voucher? It's tempting, a permanent buff for the shop, but I'm hesitant to lock up so much money. That leaves me the Reroll...\n\nRight, Reroll. Reroll gives me a shot at a Celestial Pack, which means Jupiter! Or maybe another Joker with some Multiplier. Reroll seems the best option for long-term consistency and future scaling, so let's check it. I also need to use the Joker slot I have. The Gift Card is nice, adding sell value, and having something to sell gives good value, so the standard packs might be a good purchase.\n\nThe question then is, should I buy Tarot Merchant or just reroll? I have the Telescope voucher, so Celestial Packs are ideal. A reroll is worth it. It is better to use the reroll, and keep money coming in.\n\nLooking at the history, I've had a solid run so far, so reroll it is! I'm pretty comfortable with what I currently have.\n\nFinal Decision: **reroll_shop**\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
