{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Prioritizing Flush Synergy**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 5, Round 10. The goal is clear: beat Ante 8. The primary strategy is Flushes, currently Level 4, heavily boosted by The Tribe joker. Telescope is crucial here, guaranteeing Jupiter cards in Celestial Packs to power up that Flush. To the Moon is providing steady interest. Gift Card grants a crucial 6th joker slot.\n\nI have $18. The shop's offering is key. Rocket, Green Joker, Celestial Pack, Magic Trick, and reroll are the options. Reroll is out; I'm happy with the current cards. Magic Trick isn't a priority right now.\n\nLooking at the shop, there's one Celestial Pack left, and *that's* the clear winner. I know I saw two in the shop earlier (Turn 94), and based on my previous action, I am back to buy the second one. Buying this Celestial Pack for $4 is a no-brainer with Telescope, locking in a Jupiter card for the Flush. It's an efficient move. This leaves me with $14.\n\nRocket is available for $6. It provides income, which is good, but I have a tight setup. I need to sell something and I don't really want to. The Green Joker is also $4. Again, I'd have to sell. My current Jokers are: Odd Todd (chips), Abstract (+ mult), To the Moon (interest/mult), Gift Card (free slot), The Tribe (X2 Flush), and Acrobat (X3 final hand). Current build is strong and doesn't warrant swapping to make some income (Rocket) or a minor mult (Green Joker). I'm focusing on leveling the Flush.\n\nThe Celestial Pack guarantees the level-up. It's the most efficient purchase.\n\nSo, the action is to buy the Celestial Pack. I'm going to send `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`. \n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
