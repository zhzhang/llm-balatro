The current blind is Boss (The Pillar), meaning my first hand is drawn face down. My objective is 10,000 chips, and I have zero at the moment. I have four hands and four discards remaining.\\n\\nMy joker lineup is pretty solid: Odd Todd (additive chips), Abstract Joker (additive multiplier), The Tribe (flush multiplier), and a Gift Card, which is currently negative but will provide value at the end of the round. Then there's Acrobat (multiplies the final hand) and Death (card swapping).\\n\\nI've got seven cards in hand, all face down, indices 1 through 7. Flush is level 3, which is a good hand to aim for in most cases and given the jokers I have.\\n\\nGiven the \\\"The Pillar\\\" blind effect, I'm starting with a hand of unknowns. Playing blindly would be foolish. I have no information and Acrobat is useless this early. The optimal strategy, as always, with this blind is to discard the entire first hand to see what I'm working with. I can't trigger any synergies without that information.\\n\\nTherefore, I have to discard these face-down cards to gather some intel. The objective is to find a Flush. Since all cards are face down, there's no way to optimize. I need to get information. I need to discard cards.\\n\\nI can discard up to 5 cards. My current hand consists of indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. I'm going to discard the first five cards (indices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) to reveal a hand.\\n\\nSo, I'll go with the action: `{\\\"action\\\": \\\"discard\\\", \\\"positions\\\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}`. This maximizes information gathering at the minimum hand cost. I don't see any reason to play the initial hand since it's completely blind and risky. I also need to save those hands if a situation arises where I want to use Acrobat. Death is useless in the starting blind round. The joker order is good. Odd Todd first, Abstract Joker second, then The Tribe. The Gift Card will improve at the end of the round.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4 5\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 77]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 9\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.

Ante 4/8, Round 9 against The Pillar. The boss blind gives me a face-down first hand, which is exactly where I am now. 10,000 chips needed, zero in the bank, four hands left, and only three discards. I have $6 in money, and five jokers: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, The Tribe, Gift Card, and Acrobat. I also have a Death consumable, which won't help in the current situation. I'm sitting on a Flush Level 3, ready to go. I have a partial Flush so far, with 9 of Clubs and 8 of Clubs in hand.\\n\\nMy current hand is: 2 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds, and two unknowns, plus 3 of Diamonds. I need to make a move to get a hand I can leverage.\\n\\nOdd Todd boosts my chip count for odd ranks, Abstract Joker adds mult, The Tribe doubles my mult if I have a flush, and Acrobat will triple my final hand. I need to get as much mult as I can, since my current chip count is 0.\\n\\nMy main goal is a Flush, which is critical here. I can get 65 chips and an 8 mult base from that, and then multiply it with Abstract and The Tribe. I have to maximize my chances of getting the remaining clubs I need. I currently have two clubs, so I need three more. I have 8 clubs left in the deck.\\n\\nThe Pillar's effect adds some ambiguity; the first hand is drawn face down. The key is to understand how this is applied to *discarded* hands. My initial hand was completely unknown, discarded, and then I ended up with the current hand. However, my face-down cards were never discarded. The boss effect applies to the entire original hand, not replacements, so my face-down cards 5 and 7 are *still* face down. That means I don't know their suit or rank.\\n\\nNow, I've got to play this smart. I've got two known clubs. Let's get rid of the known non-clubs (2 of Spades, 7 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds) as well as the two unknown face-down cards (positions 5 and 7). I have 3 discards remaining, and this strategy utilizes all of them for a shot at a flush. I am keeping positions 2 (9 of Clubs) and 3 (8 of Clubs) to guarantee I have a flush.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to discard positions 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7. This is the optimal move.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 4 5 6 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 78]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 9\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.

It's Ante 4, Round 9. My primary goal is 10,000 chips. The Boss Blind, \\\"The Pillar,\\\" is already dealt with \\u2013 no immediate concerns there. I have four hands left, and two discards available. My current money is a paltry $6. The Joker lineup is key: Odd Todd (which is going to be helpful here!), Abstract Joker (for that sweet mult!), The Tribe (for the Flush multiplier), Gift Card (ugh, a negative, but with a Joker slot!), and the Acrobat (X3 on the final hand!).\\n\\nMy hand is: 10 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs. Looking at this, it's clear: I have a flush! Clubs, baby! Flush Level 3, with 65 base chips and 8 base mult.\\n\\nThe flush cards are 9, 8, 7, 4, and 2 of Clubs. Odd Todd triggers on 9 and 7, which is a nice little bonus. Calculating the chips, I have 65 base, 30 from the card values, and 62 from Odd Todd (31 * 2 for the two odd ranks). Total chips: 157. The base mult is 8, plus 15 from the Abstract Joker, giving a total additive mult of 23. Then the Tribe doubles it due to the Flush, for a total of 46. This hand will score 157 * 46 = 7,222 chips.\\n\\n*Wait a minute.* I need 10,000. 7,222 isn't enough to clear the round *unless* I use the Acrobat on my *final* hand.\\n\\nShould I try to discard to chase better Odd Todd cards? The ideal Odd Todd ranks are A, 9, 7, 5, and 3. I already have the 9 and 7. There are only five Clubs left in the deck. I only have two discards remaining. If I play this flush now, I score around 7,222. That leaves 2,778 chips to find. If I play this hand, I will have three remaining, but the Acrobat will be there for the final hand to guarantee the 10,000 chip target.\\n\\nI can use the \\\"Death\\\" consumable. It lets me select two cards, and the leftmost becomes the rightmost. Right now, there isn't anything in particular I need. I already have a flush, but I could clone a useful card if I was fishing, which I am not.\\n\\nOkay, so the play is clear. I'm going to play the flush hand, and use the Acrobat on the final hand. I'll discard the flush cards: 9C, 8C, 7C, 4C, 2C. Total chip calculation is: (65 base + 30 cards + 62 Todd) * (8 base + 15 Abstract) * 2 (Tribe) = 157 * 23 * 2 = 7,222. Since the target is 10,000, I will definitely need a second hand.\\n\\n**Action: `play`**\\n\\n**Positions: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`**\\n\\n**Hand Type: `flush`**\\n\\n**Estimated Chips: `7222`**\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 3 4 5 6 7 flush 7222\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 9\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.

  "reasoning": "**Strategic Analysis: The Pillar Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 9 against The Pillar boss. I need 2,778 more chips to win, with only three hands remaining. I've got a decent hand, but I've got to play this *smart*. My hand consists of [10S, 6S, 4S, AH, JH, 10H, JD], and two discards available. I have a Gift Card, which adds $1 at the end of the round, but the priority is making chips. I have Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, The Tribe, and Acrobat in my Jokers, plus a Death consumable.\n\nMy initial thoughts run through the possible hands: high card with the Ace (~750 chips), pair of Jacks (~510 chips), two pair (~1,020 chips), or a potential flush. A flush with The Tribe's X2 multiplier seems *very* appealing, especially with Abstract Joker's multiplier, since the Tribe would *easily* get me the chips I need.\n\nI see I have 3 Spades in my hand. With the AH (Wild), I'm just one card away from a flush. The Tribe would make that a winning hand. So, my primary strategy is finding that flush, ideally with an odd card to benefit from Odd Todd.\n\nMy plan crystallizes: discard non-Spades to increase my chances of drawing the missing Spade. I have two discards, so I have a reasonable chance of getting a card needed for the Flush.\n\nI briefly consider using Death to convert cards. If I rearrange the hand, I can force two Wild cards. That's a huge boost. It's a high-risk high-reward play. It's also probably not strictly necessary.\n\nI then consider rearranging and using the Death card, but decide that a clean discard is simpler and less risky. I *really* want to discard 5, 6, 7 and hunt for that last spade. It's the cleanest, highest-probability path to victory.\n\nHowever, I pause, and then I look at all the options:\n\n*   The Death card can be used to *guarantee* a Flush, but it takes two turns. \n*   However, if I use the discard and *don't* find the Spade, I'm wasting a hand and will have to play something weaker (like Two Pair).\n\nUltimately, I decide that the guarantee of a flush with the Death card is the best play.\nI need to execute a play in the following order:\n\n*   Rearrange: I have JH, AH in the hand. I have to move JH to the position to the left of the AH.\n*   Use Death Card: Death card transforms JH into AH.\n\nI choose to rearrange the hand to prioritize the Wild card and ensure that I draw into the winning Flush. It's the most efficient way to achieve my goal. I'm going to win this round!\n\n\n"
