{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Game Plan: Maximizing Flush Power and Long-Term Scalability**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6/8, Round 12. My goal is clear: supercharge this deck and joker setup before the next blind hits. I've got $33 to work with. My joker lineup is solid: Odd Todd for chips, Abstract adding mult, \"To the Moon\" for extra interest, Gift Card as a sell-value wildcard, The Tribe x2 for Flush multiplication, and Acrobat x3 for the final hand. I’ve used Jupiter already, which is ideal for a Flush build. My Flush is already at Level 6, offering a good base chip count and mult, and the Telescope voucher guarantees I can get another Planet card (likely Jupiter, for Flush) from a Celestial Pack.\n\nThe shop has some interesting options: Walkie Talkie is useless for my Flush strategy. Riff-Raff is irrelevant since I have no free slots. Now the packs. The Celestial Packs are key. Both have a Jupiter guarantee because of the Telescope voucher. I can level my Flush from 6 to 8 by buying both packs. The Hone voucher is appealing for long-term value, as it increases the chance of finding premium editions.\n\nThe \"To the Moon\" joker is granting me double interest, which is helpful.\n\nMy priorities are clear: Level up Flush immediately. Focus on economics to maintain interest as much as possible, and then find some long-term value with the Hone voucher.\n\nI can get 2 packs and Hone for $20. Buying both packs will ensure I level the Flush hand twice for some permanent scaling, and the Hone is great to find those extra powerful cards. Spending $20 leaves me with $13, earning me roughly $4 in interest.\n\nOkay, the plan: `buy_booster 2` for the Jumbo Celestial Pack. It's guaranteed to have Jupiter which is what I want and need to use immediately to level up the Flush. The regular pack is next for an additional level, and then the Hone voucher.\n\nThe action is now: `buy_booster 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
