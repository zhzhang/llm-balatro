{"reasoning":"**Flush Strategy Optimization - Round 13**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 13 with $27, which means I'm getting a hefty $10 interest thanks to \"To the Moon.\" Let's see what this pack brings. My setup is flush-heavy: Flush level 8 with The Tribe, Abstract Joker, Acrobat, Odd Todd, and Gift Card for an extra Joker slot.\n\nThis pack presents the 4 of Spades, a Foil Queen of Diamonds, and a regular Queen of Diamonds. Initially, the 4 of Spades is out because it's even and doesn't synergize with Odd Todd. The question boils down to which Queen to select.\n\nOdd Todd wants odd ranks: A, 9, 7, 5, 3. The Queens are even. However, the Foil Queen offers +50 chips, and the regular Queen doesn't. Since I'm aiming for Flushes, a Diamond is a good pick for consistency, and that Foil bonus is great. I can quickly calculate: a Queen provides 10 base chips + 50 from the Foil = 60 chips. Even a 9 with Odd Todd's bonus would provide only 40 chips (9 + 31).\n\nMy gut says take the Foil Queen.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the score. A Flush level 8 gives 140 chips and 18 mult. Jokers give +18 (Abstract), +10 (To the Moon), x2 (The Tribe), and x3 (Acrobat). Let's calculate: (140 + 60) * (18 + 18 + 10) * 2 = 18400. That seems like a solid, realistic estimate. I think that is in the ballpark.\n\nSo, I'm going to take the Foil Queen of Diamonds.\n\nI have just verified:\n*   Action: \"select\"\n*   Positions: \\[2]\n*   Intended Hand Type: \"flush\"\n*   Estimated Chips: 18400\n\nLet's do this. I've updated the model with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 18400\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
