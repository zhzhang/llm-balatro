{"reasoning":"**Blind Select Analysis - Boss Blind \"The Head\"**\n\nOkay, here we are at the Boss Blind for Ante 5. The description is \"All Spade cards are debuffed.\" I need to hit 22,000 chips. My current build is flush-focused at level 5. This Boss Blind presents a problem, since I rely heavily on Flushes and the Spades debuff could impact that. However, even debuffed cards *count* towards the hand type, which is important. The Tribe and Abstract Joker will still trigger for the Flush.\n\nI've got the following Jokers: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, To the Moon (Holo), Gift Card, The Tribe, and Acrobat. I'm also holding the \"Death\" consumable. I'm currently at \"BLIND_SELECT.\" Hmm, the provided command list includes `play_round`, not a \"skip\" option. With a Boss Blind, there's no choice: I *must* play it.\n\nLet me analyze the options. `play_round` is the only viable one right now to advance. Other commands, like `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, and `sell_joker`, require me to be in the round phase.\n\nFirst, let me confirm my Joker order. After a quick review, my current order is already optimal for scoring: Odd Todd (Chips), Abstract (+18 Mult), To the Moon (+10 Mult), Gift Card (Utility), The Tribe (X2 Mult), Acrobat (X3 Mult). The positive effects come first. Gift Card is a non-scoring utility and doesn't affect the order.\n\nI can't use Death yet since I need to select two cards in my hand and I'm still on the blind selection screen. So `play_round` is the only action.\n\nA quick check on the \"Last Played Hands\" section. A regular flush with my build got ~12k chips at the Big Blind of Ante 5, and I need 22k. Using Acrobat (X3 Mult) on the final hand will easily clear 22,000 chips (12k * 3 = 36k). Okay, I feel good with this analysis. Let's make sure I've got the command right. The prompt provides `play_round`. The previous command was `round_select`. Time to start the match.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
