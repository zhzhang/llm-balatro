{"reasoning":"**The Plan Evolves**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante is 7/8, Round 16 (Big Blind), and I need 52,500 chips, I'm currently sitting at 36,168. So, I need to make up 16,332 chips with the 3 hands I have left. No discards, which is a key constraint.\n\nJokers are in play: Odd Todd (+31 for odd ranks), Abstract Joker (+18 mult), To the Moon (Interest + $1, Holo: +10 mult), Gift Card (sell value). The Tribe (x2 mult if a flush) and Acrobat (x3 mult on the final hand of the round) are going to be key.\n\nMy hand: King of Spades, Wild 6 of Spades, Steel Ace of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, Steel Ace of Clubs, 9 of Clubs. A decent starting point.\n\nFirst, I consider a Flush. It's got potential, as I have the Aces, 9s. I can see I can't currently form a flush unless I sacrifice a Steel Ace. No.\n\nNext, I calculate a Three of a Kind (Aces).  Playing the Steel Aces and the standard Ace.  I run the numbers:  30 base + 3 Aces (11 each) + 93 (from Odd Todd) = 156 chips. With the Jokers and Steel, the total Mult would be 31, and the total score is 4,836. That is not enough.\n\nThen I try to think broader: Should I play for a smaller hand to cycle cards? If I play a pair of 9s, that could give me some chips (around 6,000) while getting me closer to the Acrobat x3 bonus on the final hand. Still, 10k is what I need.\n\nPlaying towards Acrobat is the strategy. Currently, I need to get to my final hand. I am thinking I can't just win it by playing Three of a Kind.\n\nOkay, let's re-evaluate a Full House (Aces and 9s). If I play a Full House with 2 Steel Aces, I get about 10,656 total.\n\nI re-evaluate: A \"Flush\" is the way.  A Flush with the Wild Card in my current hand.  If I got a flush, it's 140 chips, 18 Mult. with Acrobat, The Tribe (x2) and steel cards (x1.5).  It's likely I can win.  Yes, the Mult would be *very* high: (18 + 18 + 10) * 2 * 3 * 1.5 * 1.5. This would clear 16,332 easily!\n\nSo, the strategy is this:\n\n1.  Play a small hand to get new cards, fishing for that flush.\n2.  Play another small hand.\n3.  The big flush hand on the final play.\n\nThe key is getting that flush.\n\nI need a junk hand, to get new cards.  I should not play the Aces.  I'll play: King of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs.\n\nI *need* to keep the Aces and Wild Card.  So: I want to keep the Aces, and the Wild Card. And fish.\n\nSo, I decide: Play Junk. Play 1, 4, 7. But...the 9 is \"odd\" so I will benefit! I can play 1, 4, 7 for a pair of 9s and it will make me a bit more money.\n\nThen, there's the wild card! It says it can create the Planet card. It enhances! Oh!\n\nSo my final plan, is this:\n\nHand 3: Play the junk hand to improve my draw. The hands are 1, 4, 7.\nHand 2: (Play junk hand).\nHand 1: The winning flush. (If I get there!)\n\nI check the Three of a Kind with the Aces. Again: 4,836. This is not enough. I must get to the final hand.\n\nLet's just play: King of Spades and 9 of Hearts and see. I can draw into a Flush!\n\nThe hand type is just a \"High Card King\".\n\nI make the decision: The goal is to get to the *last* hand for Acrobat. So I should play junk until I have 1 hand left.\n\n*Action:* Play 1, 4. No, play 1, 4,\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,7]"}
