{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 3, Round 5, and I'm sitting on $9. The Coupon Tag is active, which is fantastic because it means the initial shop items are free. This is huge.\n\nI've got a solid Joker setup: Zany Joker, Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, Turtle Bean, and The Tribe. My Joker capacity is maxed out at 5/5. My hand is built around Flushes, and it's Level 3. The immediate goal is to prepare for the Boss Blind; I recall the description: -1 hand size, which I think points to The Pillar. The target for this Boss Blind is 4000.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see a Gift Card, Mars, a Mega Arcana Pack, and a Standard Pack, all priced at $0 thanks to the coupon. I also see a Telescope for $10, which is out of reach this round.\n\nThe Mega Arcana Pack is a \"Choose 2 of 5\" pack, so it offers the greatest potential immediate value. Buying it is my top priority. The Standard Pack is next, followed by Mars, which levels up Four of a Kind, but is less relevant to my current Flush-focused build. The Gift Card looks tempting as it increases sell value, but to acquire it I'd need to sell a Joker and that isn't worth it in this moment.\n\nZany Joker is the weakest link in my Joker lineup given my Flush build. I need to make a tough decision about that. The Gift Card, however, is a long-term economic boost.\n\nTherefore, the action plan is clear: I'll buy the Mega Arcana Pack. It's the most impactful free item in this shop. After that, I will buy the Standard Pack and Mars. Buying the Gift Card is not an option as things stand.\n\nThe syntax for buying the Mega Arcana Pack should be `buy_booster 1`. That's what I'll do.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
