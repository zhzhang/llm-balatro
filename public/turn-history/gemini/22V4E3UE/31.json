{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State and Making the Optimal Move**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 2, Round 3, in the shop phase. I've only got a single dollar to my name. The shop is a bust – nothing affordable, and I already bought the Turtle Bean last turn. No use in even looking further. Let's see... my inventory is pretty decent, given the circumstances: Zany Joker for those sweet 3-of-a-kind multipliers, Odd Todd for some chip boosts, Abstract Joker for overall mult, and The Tribe for Flushes – perfect for that x2 mult at the end. I also have the Turtle Bean, which adds some nice hand size.\n\nI've already re-ordered my Jokers optimally, with The Tribe at the end for maximum Flush synergy. The hand levels show I can go for a Full House (at Level 3, 90x8) and a Flush (Level 2, 50x6), but my hand size limits.\n\nLet's do a quick calculation of my options.\n\nIf I go for the Flush, the numbers are as follows:\n\n*   Base Chips: 50.\n*   Odd Todd Chips: +31 per odd card.\n*   Base Mult: 6.\n*   Abstract Mult: +15.\n*   The Tribe (x2)\n*   Total Mult: 42.\n\nIf I go for a Full House:\n\n*   Base Chips: 90.\n*   Odd Todd Chips: +31 per odd card.\n*   Base Mult: 8.\n*   Zany Mult: +12.\n*   Abstract Mult: +15.\n*   Total Mult: 35.\n\nConsidering the Blind has the same Ante level, I need to choose the hand type with the highest score that I can consistently hit.\n\nThe shop is definitively exhausted. There's nothing more I can do here. Therefore, the only logical action is to leave the shop. I should select the next round. `action`: \"round\\_select\". Time to get back in the game and beat this round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
