{"reasoning":"**The Calculation**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 4, Round 9 against \"Boss (The Pillar)\", and I need 10,000 chips to advance. Currently, I've got 7,222, so I need to make another 2,778 with only three hands remaining and one discard. My money's at $6, so I really need to make this count.\n\nI've got a decent hand: 10 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 4 of Spades, and an Ace of Hearts (which is a Wild Card!). I've also got a Queen of Clubs, and it's a bonus card that will give me +30 chips.\n\nI have some powerful Jokers in play: \"Odd Todd\" (adds chips for odd cards), \"Abstract Joker\" (a flat multiplier), \"The Tribe\" (a 2x multiplier if I hit a Flush), \"Gift Card\" (adds a Joker slot), and \"Acrobat\" (a 3x multiplier on the *final* hand of the round).\n\nMy immediate thought is, with those Spades and the Wild Ace, I can make a Flush, right? Flush Level 3, to be exact. Let's see... base chips 65, base multiplier of 8. I have two odd cards: the 7 and the Ace. I can use the Ace as a Spade. Odd Todd will give me a boost of 31 chips for each of those two odd cards, for a total of 62 chips. So, the total chips I can get from this flush are 65 (base) + 10 (10S) + 7 (7S) + 6 (6S) + 4 (4S) + 11 (A-Spades) + 62 (Todd) which comes out to 165.\n\nThe base multiplier is 8, but I have the \"Abstract Joker\" which adds 15 to it. Also, \"The Tribe\" doubles the multiplier if I have a Flush. So, the total multiplier is (8 + 15) * 2 = 46.\n\nTherefore, the total hand score will be 165 (chips) * 46 (mult) = 7,590.\n\nSince I only need 2,778 chips, I'll clear the round with no problem (7,222 + 7,590 = 14,812). I don't need to consider any other cards or discards to win. I should just play the hand I have! Let's do it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 7590\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
