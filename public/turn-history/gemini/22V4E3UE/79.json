Ante 4/8, Round 9 against The Pillar. The boss blind gives me a face-down first hand, which is exactly where I am now. 10,000 chips needed, zero in the bank, four hands left, and only three discards. I have $6 in money, and five jokers: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, The Tribe, Gift Card, and Acrobat. I also have a Death consumable, which won't help in the current situation. I'm sitting on a Flush Level 3, ready to go. I have a partial Flush so far, with 9 of Clubs and 8 of Clubs in hand.\\n\\nMy current hand is: 2 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds, and two unknowns, plus 3 of Diamonds. I need to make a move to get a hand I can leverage.\\n\\nOdd Todd boosts my chip count for odd ranks, Abstract Joker adds mult, The Tribe doubles my mult if I have a flush, and Acrobat will triple my final hand. I need to get as much mult as I can, since my current chip count is 0.\\n\\nMy main goal is a Flush, which is critical here. I can get 65 chips and an 8 mult base from that, and then multiply it with Abstract and The Tribe. I have to maximize my chances of getting the remaining clubs I need. I currently have two clubs, so I need three more. I have 8 clubs left in the deck.\\n\\nThe Pillar's effect adds some ambiguity; the first hand is drawn face down. The key is to understand how this is applied to *discarded* hands. My initial hand was completely unknown, discarded, and then I ended up with the current hand. However, my face-down cards were never discarded. The boss effect applies to the entire original hand, not replacements, so my face-down cards 5 and 7 are *still* face down. That means I don't know their suit or rank.\\n\\nNow, I've got to play this smart. I've got two known clubs. Let's get rid of the known non-clubs (2 of Spades, 7 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds) as well as the two unknown face-down cards (positions 5 and 7). I have 3 discards remaining, and this strategy utilizes all of them for a shot at a flush. I am keeping positions 2 (9 of Clubs) and 3 (8 of Clubs) to guarantee I have a flush.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to discard positions 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7. This is the optimal move.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 4 5 6 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 78]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 9\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.

It's Ante 4, Round 9. My primary goal is 10,000 chips. The Boss Blind, \\\"The Pillar,\\\" is already dealt with \\u2013 no immediate concerns there. I have four hands left, and two discards available. My current money is a paltry $6. The Joker lineup is key: Odd Todd (which is going to be helpful here!), Abstract Joker (for that sweet mult!), The Tribe (for the Flush multiplier), Gift Card (ugh, a negative, but with a Joker slot!), and the Acrobat (X3 on the final hand!).\\n\\nMy hand is: 10 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs. Looking at this, it's clear: I have a flush! Clubs, baby! Flush Level 3, with 65 base chips and 8 base mult.\\n\\nThe flush cards are 9, 8, 7, 4, and 2 of Clubs. Odd Todd triggers on 9 and 7, which is a nice little bonus. Calculating the chips, I have 65 base, 30 from the card values, and 62 from Odd Todd (31 * 2 for the two odd ranks). Total chips: 157. The base mult is 8, plus 15 from the Abstract Joker, giving a total additive mult of 23. Then the Tribe doubles it due to the Flush, for a total of 46. This hand will score 157 * 46 = 7,222 chips.\\n\\n*Wait a minute.* I need 10,000. 7,222 isn't enough to clear the round *unless* I use the Acrobat on my *final* hand.\\n\\nShould I try to discard to chase better Odd Todd cards? The ideal Odd Todd ranks are A, 9, 7, 5, and 3. I already have the 9 and 7. There are only five Clubs left in the deck. I only have two discards remaining. If I play this flush now, I score around 7,222. That leaves 2,778 chips to find. If I play this hand, I will have three remaining, but the Acrobat will be there for the final hand to guarantee the 10,000 chip target.\\n\\nI can use the \\\"Death\\\" consumable. It lets me select two cards, and the leftmost becomes the rightmost. Right now, there isn't anything in particular I need. I already have a flush, but I could clone a useful card if I was fishing, which I am not.\\n\\nOkay, so the play is clear. I'm going to play the flush hand, and use the Acrobat on the final hand. I'll discard the flush cards: 9C, 8C, 7C, 4C, 2C. Total chip calculation is: (65 base + 30 cards + 62 Todd) * (8 base + 15 Abstract) * 2 (Tribe) = 157 * 23 * 2 = 7,222. Since the target is 10,000, I will definitely need a second hand.\\n\\n**Action: `play`**\\n\\n**Positions: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`**\\n\\n**Hand Type: `flush`**\\n\\n**Estimated Chips: `7222`**\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 3 4 5 6 7 flush 7222\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 79]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 9\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.

I need 2,778 more chips to win, with only three hands remaining. I've got a decent hand, but I've got to play this *smart*. My hand consists of [10S, 6S, 4S, AH, JH, 10H, JD], and two discards available. I have a Gift Card, which adds $1 at the end of the round, but the priority is making chips. I have Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, The Tribe, and Acrobat in my Jokers, plus a Death consumable.\\n\\nMy initial thoughts run through the possible hands: high card with the Ace (~750 chips), pair of Jacks (~510 chips), two pair (~1,020 chips), or a potential flush. A flush with The Tribe's X2 multiplier seems *very* appealing, especially with Abstract Joker's multiplier, since the Tribe would *easily* get me the chips I need.\\n\\nI see I have 3 Spades in my hand. With the AH (Wild), I'm just one card away from a flush. The Tribe would make that a winning hand. So, my primary strategy is finding that flush, ideally with an odd card to benefit from Odd Todd.\\n\\nMy plan crystallizes: discard non-Spades to increase my chances of drawing the missing Spade. I have two discards, so I have a reasonable chance of getting a card needed for the Flush.\\n\\nI briefly consider using Death to convert cards. If I rearrange the hand, I can force two Wild cards. That's a huge boost. It's a high-risk high-reward play. It's also probably not strictly necessary.\\n\\nI then consider rearranging and using the Death card, but decide that a clean discard is simpler and less risky. I *really* want to discard 5, 6, 7 and hunt for that last spade. It's the cleanest, highest-probability path to victory.\\n\\nHowever, I pause, and then I look at all the options:\\n\\n*   The Death card can be used to *guarantee* a Flush, but it takes two turns. \\n*   However, if I use the discard and *don't* find the Spade, I'm wasting a hand and will have to play something weaker (like Two Pair).\\n\\nUltimately, I decide that the guarantee of a flush with the Death card is the best play.\\nI need to execute a play in the following order:\\n\\n*   Rearrange: I have JH, AH in the hand. I have to move JH to the position to the left of the AH.\\n*   Use Death Card: Death card transforms JH into AH.\\n\\nI choose to rearrange the hand to prioritize the Wild card and ensure that I draw into the winning Flush. It's the most efficient way to achieve my goal. I'm going to win this round!\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 5 6 7\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 9\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.

  "reasoning": "**The Calculation**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 4, Round 9 against \"Boss (The Pillar)\", and I need 10,000 chips to advance. Currently, I've got 7,222, so I need to make another 2,778 with only three hands remaining and one discard. My money's at $6, so I really need to make this count.\n\nI've got a decent hand: 10 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 4 of Spades, and an Ace of Hearts (which is a Wild Card!). I've also got a Queen of Clubs, and it's a bonus card that will give me +30 chips.\n\nI have some powerful Jokers in play: \"Odd Todd\" (adds chips for odd cards), \"Abstract Joker\" (a flat multiplier), \"The Tribe\" (a 2x multiplier if I hit a Flush), \"Gift Card\" (adds a Joker slot), and \"Acrobat\" (a 3x multiplier on the *final* hand of the round).\n\nMy immediate thought is, with those Spades and the Wild Ace, I can make a Flush, right? Flush Level 3, to be exact. Let's see... base chips 65, base multiplier of 8. I have two odd cards: the 7 and the Ace. I can use the Ace as a Spade. Odd Todd will give me a boost of 31 chips for each of those two odd cards, for a total of 62 chips. So, the total chips I can get from this flush are 65 (base) + 10 (10S) + 7 (7S) + 6 (6S) + 4 (4S) + 11 (A-Spades) + 62 (Todd) which comes out to 165.\n\nThe base multiplier is 8, but I have the \"Abstract Joker\" which adds 15 to it. Also, \"The Tribe\" doubles the multiplier if I have a Flush. So, the total multiplier is (8 + 15) * 2 = 46.\n\nTherefore, the total hand score will be 165 (chips) * 46 (mult) = 7,590.\n\nSince I only need 2,778 chips, I'll clear the round with no problem (7,222 + 7,590 = 14,812). I don't need to consider any other cards or discards to win. I should just play the hand I have! Let's do it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 7590\n}\n```\n\n\n"
