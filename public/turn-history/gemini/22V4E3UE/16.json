{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante and Joker Selection**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process for this decision. We're in Ante 2, and the key is to maximize our scoring potential. I've got a Zany Joker, which is great for a 3-of-a-kind build, and The Tribe, a strong multiplier for Flushes. The game is giving me a choice between the Wrathful Joker, which boosts Multiplier for Spades, and Odd Todd, which gives chips for odd ranks.\n\nInitially, my instinct was to lean towards Wrathful, as it synergizes with the Tribe if I focused on Spade Flushes.  A 5-card Spades Flush with Wrathful is a big multiplier: 38x. However, Odd Todd is a fantastic source of chips, which is a resource I currently lack with my existing Joker setup (Zany is a multiplier, The Tribe is an XMult). Early-game chips are *crucial*. I have to balance the potential of a high-scoring flush against the consistent chip boost Odd Todd would offer.\n\nLet's do some quick calculations. A regular flush with The Tribe gives 280. A spade flush with Wrathful and The Tribe would give 1330. With Odd Todd, and a similar flush with three odd cards, the score would be 1024. Then there's my 3-of-a-kind option (Zany Joker). That with Odd Todd would give a score of 1845.  Wrathful is very specific (Spades), whereas Odd Todd works with any odd rank across suits.\n\nAlthough Wrathful Joker is tempting, especially paired with The Tribe, Odd Todd really stands out as a strong choice for providing chips early on. Since Odd Todd's rank list (A, 9, 7, 5, 3) contains a lot of cards in a standard deck, it's very versatile, and it would give a significant boost to a 3-of-a-kind hand, which I've had success with. Also, since I already own \"The Tribe,\" I'm incentivized to play flushes. However, the flat chip amount from Odd Todd is better than a situational +mult from Wrathful. My goal at this stage should be to build the most impactful early-game hand. I have the Joker slots.\n\nSo, Odd Todd it is. The action is `select 2`.  I've double-checked the command format, and I just need to specify the selected position. The command to be sent is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
