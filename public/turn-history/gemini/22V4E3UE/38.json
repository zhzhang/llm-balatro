{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Best Move: Skip or Play?**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 3, Round 4, BLIND_SELECT phase. I've got $2, which is tight. My build is Flush-focused with The Tribe, Abstract Joker, and Odd Todd. The Hanged Man consumable is in hand, and I'm aiming for a Flush hand to hit the 3000 chip Big Blind next.\n\nHere's the situation: do I play the Small Blind, or do I skip? Playing gets me $3 immediately, potentially up to $7 with interest. But skipping gives me the \"Coupon Tag,\" which means the *next* shop is completely free. Initial cards and booster packs... that's huge when I'm broke. A free Mega Booster or a decent Joker is worth way more than $3 and some interest.\n\nMy initial thought was to play and use The Hanged Man to thin the deck for a stronger Flush. However, I can't use the Hanged Man until I have a hand visible, and that's *not* during the current step. Skipping immediately takes me to the Big Blind select. So it doesn't even make sense to skip and use the hanged man immediately.\n\nSo, skipping means I must still beat the Big Blind of 3000 chips. A single Flush easily does that. I'm hitting ~4600 chips with a Flush. Then, after beating the Big Blind, the shop comes up and the Coupon Tag kicks in!\n\nTherefore, the value is clearly in the Coupon Tag, especially when money is so low.\n\nHere's the comparison. If I play: $2 -> $6 (win) -> spend money at the shop -> Big Blind. If I skip: $2 -> Big Blind -> beat the blind and get $4 for a win -> Shop (free stuff).\n\nThe Coupon Tag is the clear winner here. My gut says go for the skip.\n\n**Action: \"skip_round\"**\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
