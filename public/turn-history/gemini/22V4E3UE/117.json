{"reasoning":"**My Analysis of the Current Game State & Action**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. It's Ante 6, Round 12. I'm in the PLANET\\_PACK phase, thanks to the Celestial Pack. I've got $23 and a decent Joker spread: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker providing a solid +18 Mult, To the Moon for extra interest and +10 Mult, Gift Card for an additional slot and increased sell value (which could be useful), The Tribe doubling my Flush Multiplier, and Acrobat giving me x3 on my final hand, which could be powerful.\n\nMy strategy is clearly Flush-focused, aiming for Level 7 with 125 chips and 16 multiplier, and with the Telescope voucher, I'm guaranteed Jupiter in this pack. Now, the pack choices are: Jupiter (Flush bonus), Neptune (Straight Flush bonus), and Pluto (High Card bonus).\n\nGiven the Flush-centric build – The Tribe Joker is key here, and I'm playing Flushes primarily – Jupiter is the obvious choice. It upgrades the Flush to level 8, granting +15 chips and +2 mult for Flush. Neptune could provide +40 chips and +4 mult for Straight Flush, but that's not what I'm focused on. Pluto's just not relevant.\n\nSo, the action is to *select* Jupiter, which is in position 1 in the booster pack. The immediate command I need is `select 1`. I need to output a single, parseable JSON object for the next turn, with double-quoted values and no extra cruft.\n\nLet's see: `action` is \"select\", and `positions` is \\[1]. I don't *need* `intended_hand_type` or `estimated_chips` in the JSON, they're optional according to the schema. That's good; it simplifies things. So, I don't need to specify either, and can skip those parameters.\n\nDouble-checking... `select` takes only the position.\n\nHere's the JSON I'll use:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
