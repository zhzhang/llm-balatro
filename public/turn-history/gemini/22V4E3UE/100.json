{"reasoning":"**Flush for the Win!**\n\nAlright, let's see what we've got. Ante 5, Round 11, Boss \"The Head\" (Spades debuffed). Goal is 22,000 chips. Got zero chips, four hands left. Let's make this count. I have a decent hand with some promising Jokers: Odd Todd for odd ranks, Abstract Joker for mult, To the Moon for a mult boost, Gift Card for an extra slot, The Tribe for double Flush mult, and Acrobat for that sweet x3 on the final hand. Got the Death consumable too, and that's *critical* here.\n\nMy current hand has some potential, but needs a nudge: 6H, 2H, 3C (Odd), KD, 6D, 4D, 3D (Odd). I have 4 Diamonds, but that 3 of Clubs is messing up my Flush! Since this is the Spades debuff, that 3 of Clubs will do nothing to help on any hand.  I have two of the Odd cards already, so that's a good start. I can move the 3 of Diamonds to sit next to the 3 of Clubs (7 to 3). The Death consumable can then convert the left card (the 3 of Clubs) to match the right card (the 3 of Diamonds), giving me the Flush I need.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. With a Flush (Level 5) and these cards, I have a decent base score of 95 chips and 12 mult. That Odd Todd triggers on those 3s, giving me +62 chips, and that gets multiplied to a total of 80 mult with my Jokers. This gives me a rough total of 14,640 chips. Not enough for 22,000, but the real key is the Acrobat joker, which would give me a x3 multiplier. I can play the discard a bunch strategy!\n\nBut, first, I need that flush. Death is going to be key. Let me double check what Death actually does... \"convert the left card into the right card.\" So, using Death with position 3 and position 7 is perfect. Position 3 will then be my target and 7 my source. 3C gets turned into 3D. \n\nBefore I do anything else, let's make the move. Death will create the flush, then I can see what I can do with discards, or just go for the final hand play.\n\nSo, here we go: The Death tarot is at position 1, 3C at position 3, 3D at position 7. I'll use the JSON `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 3, 7], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`.\n\nPerfect. The play is set. Time to deal with these cards and get to that winning hand!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,3,7]"}
