{"reasoning":"**Planet Pack Selection: Jupiter's Call**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 5/8, Round 10. We're in the PLANET_PACK phase after buying a Celestial Pack. I've got $18 and a decent inventory, but right now, I'm focused on this booster. My hand's leaning heavily into Flushes – it's Level 3 with a base of 65 chips and 8x mult, and I've played it eight times, which means The Tribe is going to be my money maker here. I also have the Telescope voucher, which means I *know* Jupiter is in the pack, so there's no real question of strategy. The Jupiter booster will give a bonus to Flush and I need to keep those multipliers going. I'm choosing Jupiter.\n\nThe command is `select <pack_card_position>`. Jupiter is at position 1. So, the action is `select`, the positions are `[1]`, and since this is a planet pack and not a hand selection, `intended_hand_type` and `estimated_chips` are both `null`.\n\nNow, I *need* to be absolutely sure this JSON is perfectly formatted. Last time, the system had trouble with that. Let's double-check the schema again... Got it. `action`: \"select\", `positions`: `[1]`, `intended_hand_type`: `null`, `estimated_chips`: `null`. I need to ensure it's a valid JSON object. Okay, I've got it.\n\nThe schema expects a JSON object with those fields. \"select\" is a valid action and the `positions` and the `intended_hand_type` is required and should be null, which it is in this case. Also, `estimated_chips` is null. The plan is straightforward. Jupiter is the obvious and only choice.\n\nSo, the resulting JSON should be: `{\"action\":\"select\",\"positions\":[1],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}`. Let's send that off and hope for the best.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
