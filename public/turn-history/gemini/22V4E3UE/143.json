{"reasoning":"**Current Strategic Analysis: Ante 7, Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 7, round 14, and in the shop phase. I've got $26, and a strong hand with a Flush Level 8, but I'm thinking about maximizing my score. I just bought \"The Fool,\" which copies the \"The Sun\" tarot, that targets cards to hearts, that I need to use in the upcoming round. I have maxed out Jokers: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, and Acrobat. So I need to decide what to do in the shop. I have the Telescope voucher and a single Fool consumable. I need to make some decisions.\n\n\"Photograph\" is tempting; it gives a 2x mult on the first face card. I have Queens in the deck, so it's potentially very strong, but I'd have to sell Odd Todd (+31 chips) to make room. The flat chip boost from Odd Todd is nice, but I'm leaning toward mult scaling at this point in the game. It will give me a 2x bonus IF I can get face cards to play. I'm debating the trade-off.\n\nI need to quickly analyze potential moves. Hone, which doubles the appearance of foils/holos/polys, is $10. Not essential right now, and I'd prefer a bigger impact. A reroll is $6. That's potentially interesting, especially if I can hit a Planet pack with the Telescope, but that's a gamble. It makes my interest drop from $10 to $8, which makes it less efficient.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target score, and the \"Fool\" is essential to maximize my flush plays in the next round, so I need to go to the round select to get the best out of my current hand. I can't use the Fool in the shop. I need to get the \"Sun\" in play. I can't think of anything else.\n\nI need to see the \"Last Played Hands\" scores to get a baseline for how much I need to score. The Ante 7 blinds are pretty high, and the boss is much higher. I need all the power I can get.\n\nI've got $26, and I need to start playing my hand. I'm prioritizing the hand, and optimizing the deck is key. Rerolling might be good, but it's not a must-buy.\n\nLet's check the Joker order. My order is OK: flat chips/mult first, then multiplier Jokers.\n\nOkay, here's the plan.\n\n1.  I have already bought The Fool.\n2.  I don't need any immediate purchases.\n3.  Proceed to Round Select to use The Fool on the first hand.\n\nI'm thinking one more thing: Reroll for a Planet Pack with Jupiter. It's a risk. Is it worth it? No, going to the round is the safe play.\n\nAlright, what am I missing? I *see* \"Photograph,\" again. It's 2x Mult.\n\nMult currently: 46 (Base + Abstract + To the Moon)\n\nThe Tribe: 46 \\* 2 = 92.\n\nAcrobat (last hand): 92 \\* 3 = 276.\n\nBase chips are 140 (Flush), + Odd Todd.\n\nBase score: 140 \\* 92 = 12,880 (not enough for high blinds).\n\nWith Acrobat: 140 \\* 276 = 38,640.\n\nI need to maximize Hearts, and then get high value cards, for the flush. \"The Fool\" will help.\n\nOkay, let's look at \"Photograph\" again: Sell Odd Todd (+11) to buy \"Photograph\" (-5).\n\nMult: Base (15) + 18 (Abstract) + 10 (To the Moon) = 43.\n\nWith a Face Card: 43 \\* 2 (Photograph) \\* 2 (Tribe) = 172.\n\nScore: 140 \\* 172 = 24,080.\n\nCurrent Odd Todd: (140 + 31) \\* 92 = 15,732.\n\nPhotograph is better, *if* I have face cards. I *do* have Queens. It's tempting but selling is a commitment.\n\nIt is better to get the hand in play and use \"The Fool\" to build towards the flush. Let's start the round and progress.\n\nI'm moving to `round_select` to start the next hand.\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
