{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State: A Strategic Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 2 with $7 and looking at the shop. My hand centers around Flushes (thanks to The Tribe Joker, which doubles Flush multiplier) and Odd Todd, which gives me chips for odd-ranked cards. Zany Joker is also in play, boosting my score for 3 of a Kind.\n\nThe shop's offering me a Business Card for $4, which has a 50% chance of giving me $2 for each face card I play. Then there's the Crystal Ball for $10 to unlock a new consumable slot; too expensive right now. Finally, the reroll is a pricey $5.\n\nMy strategy right now is to lean into Flushes and Odd Todd. The Business Card feels a little bit off-key given this strategy. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) aren't \"odd\" ranks, according to Odd Todd. They also aren't Aces. It's not a complete contradiction, but it's not ideal synergy.\n\nI can afford the Business Card, I would have $3 left (no interest). Alternatively, I can save the $7 to gain $1 interest. At this early stage, that additional $1 is significant.\n\nLooking at it more carefully, I've already bought my booster pack. I can see I can get +$1 in interest with $7 and the strategy is focused on odd cards for now. The Business Card isn't bad for the economy in general, but it doesn't really help my current build as much as it would in other builds.\n\nI think the best move here is to save the money and move on to the next round. I'll take the interest and re-evaluate my options next round. So the action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
