{"reasoning":"**The Plan for The Pillar**\n\nAlright, let's get down to business. Ante 6/8, Round 14, and the Boss Blind is \"The Pillar,\" which means face-down cards. I need a whopping 40,000 chips total, and I'm currently sitting at 27,600. That leaves me with 12,400 chips to earn with only three hands remaining, and two discards. I'm also sitting on a $27 bankroll.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty sweet: I have Odd Todd (odd rank cards, which gives a nice chip boost), Abstract Joker (18 mult), To the Moon (10 mult, interest bonus), Gift Card (negative, +1 slot, increases sell value), The Tribe (x2 mult for Flushes), and Acrobat (x3 mult on the final hand). The cards I currently hold are an 8 of Spades, 4 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts (odd!), a Steel Ace of Clubs, a Queen of Diamonds, and a 10 of Diamonds – and one face-down card. The steel Ace is particularly interesting because it's Steel (x1.5 mult), and also an Ace (odd).\n\nThe target is 12,400 chips. A Flush at level 8 gets a base of 140 chips and 18 Mult. A Three of a Kind is 30 base, 3 mult. A Pair is 10 base, 2 mult. A High Card is only 5 base, 1 mult, and with the Jokers I can boost this to 1,131 (not good enough).\n\nSo, my current hand: two diamonds, and possibly a third. With the Tribe Joker, a flush is the obvious play. I have 11 diamonds remaining in a 34-card deck, so about a 32% chance. I have to discard some trash.\n\nSince I have two diamonds in hand, and one unknown card, my plan is to discard the cards that aren’t diamonds: 8 of Spades, 4 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, and that mystery card. I’ll keep the Steel Ace because it boosts mult, and it also boosts the potential for Odd Todd if I somehow end up not getting the Flush. I'll take my chances.\n\nLet's do some math: With a Flush, and the Steel Ace in hand, I can expect to have chips around 170 (Base + Cards + some Odd Todd). Mults will be (18 base + 18 Abstract + 10 To the Moon) * 2 (Tribe) * 1.5 (Steel) = 138 mult. That totals 23,460, more than enough for the win!\n\nSo the strategy is set: Discard to find a Flush. It's time to discard cards 1, 2, 3, and 7! I'll check the unknown card rank after the discard. I have two discards and three hands so I'm playing it safe. I'm going for the Flush.\n\nMy Jokers are set. Odd Todd, Abstract, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, Acrobat. Order is: 1) Played Cards Score (Odd Todd), 2) Independent Jokers (Abstract and To the Moon), 3) Mult Modifiers (The Tribe, Acrobat). Perfect.\n\nNow, let's do this: Discard cards at positions 1, 2, 3 and 7.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,7]"}
