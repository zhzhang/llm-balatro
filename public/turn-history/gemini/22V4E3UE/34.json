{"reasoning":"**Celestial Pack is the Play**\n\nOkay, let's see. Ante is at 3/8, Round 4, and I'm in the SHOP step with $9. I've got a solid Joker setup: Zany (+12 Mult for 3-of-a-Kind), Odd Todd (+31 Chips for odd ranks), Abstract (+15 Mult for each Joker, and I have 5), Turtle Bean (+4 hand size), and The Tribe (X2 Mult for Flush). Hand levels are decent, with a Full House at Level 3, Flush at Level 2, Straight Flush at 1, and Four of a Kind at Level 2.\n\nIn the shop, I see *The Hanged Man* for $3, *Marble Joker* for $6, a *Celestial Pack* and an *Arcana Pack*, each for $4, and a *Telescope* voucher that's way out of my budget at $10. My goal is to either improve my deck or score potential. I have $9, and I'm at the max 5/5 Joker slots.\n\n*The Hanged Man* is tempting – destroying 2 cards could thin the deck. *Marble Joker* would add Stone cards. While that's tempting to try and increase my score, Stone cards have no suits and would conflict with *The Tribe's* flush bonus. *Celestial Pack* levels up hands, which is always good. The *Arcana Pack* adds Tarot cards, which could be helpful later.\n\nThe priority is to improve scoring potential and maintain/increase my hand level. I can either buy the Celestial Pack and the Arcana Pack ($8), or the Celestial pack and The Hanged Man ($7), or just save money for a bit.\n\nThe *Celestial Pack* seems like the high-priority move to level up hands, and it fits into my current budget. If I buy it for $4, I'll have $5 left, earning $1 in interest. I could buy two packs, but that leaves me with $1 and no interest. *The Hanged Man* is interesting, but I have 0 consumable slots. So that's out. I could sell Zany Joker for $2, and buy the Marble Joker (+$50 chips). But, Stone cards won't help with Flushes.\n\nThe best play is the Celestial Pack.\n\nOkay, let's do this.\n\n`action`: \"buy_booster\"\n`positions`: [1] (Celestial Pack)\n\nI have $9, and the Celestial Pack is $4. After buying it, I'll have $5.\n\nThe Marble Joker is tempting, but doesn't synergize with The Tribe. I can’t buy the Hanged Man just yet.\n\nSo, the play is still the *Celestial Pack*.\n\n`Action: buy_booster`\n`Positions: [1]`\n\nFinal check: Celestial Pack costs $4. After buying it, I have $5, which means interest.\nThe hand level is improved.\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
