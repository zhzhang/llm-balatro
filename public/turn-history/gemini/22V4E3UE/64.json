{"reasoning":"**The Flush is the Thing!**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 7, Ante 4/8 with $8. We're running a TAROT_PACK (Arcana Pack). My hand consists of: Queen Spades, Jack Spades, 3 Spades, 2 Spades, 9 Hearts, 6 Hearts, 4 Diamonds, 2 Diamonds. The build is heavily reliant on Flushes, specifically Level 3 Flush, with The Tribe (X2 for Flush) and Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd ranks) as the main synergy drivers. My hand right now is very light on Diamonds, but I want to build a Flush.\n\nMy Tarot choices are: The Magician (2 Lucky cards), The Wheel of Fortune (gamble for upgrades), and The Star (convert cards to Diamonds). The Magician doesn't help the Flush as much as The Star does. The Wheel is too unreliable. The Star is the most helpful option. \"The Star\" converts up to 3 cards to Diamonds. Perfect!\n\nI need to convert non-Diamonds. Since I'm running Odd Todd, ideally, I'd convert some odd-ranked non-Diamonds. Let's see... looking at the hand: Queen Spades, Jack Spades, 3 Spades, 2 Spades, 9 Hearts, 6 Hearts... I'm thinking I can convert the Spades, but wait, both the 3 of Spades and 9 of Hearts are odd! Converting either to Diamond is great since Odd Todd is based on rank! The goal is to maximize Diamond density. Queen Spades, Jack Spades, and 3 Spades are the best choices! Wait! No! I want a Diamond 9 to retain the Odd rank but gain the Diamond suit.\n\nOkay, let's nail this down. So, the command is \"select 3 1 2 3\". The `action` is \"select,\" and `positions` are [3, 1, 2, 3]. I chose the Star, and I'm converting the Queen of Spades (1), Jack of Spades (2), and the 3 of Spades (3) to Diamonds to get the most out of The Star. The new hand will have a higher density of Diamonds, which is what I want for the flush.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,1,2,3]"}
