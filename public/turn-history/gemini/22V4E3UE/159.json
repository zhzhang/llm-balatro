{"reasoning":"**Okay, here's the plan. Ante is at 7/8, Big Blind. I'm short, needing a hefty 13,407 chips with only two hands left. The immediate goal? Survive and set up the grand finale with Acrobat's x3 multiplier on the last hand. I've got a decent hand, but I need to play it smart.**\n\nRight now, I've got a Wild Card (6 of Spades) which opens up possibilities. My strategy hinges on making a flush on that last hand, activating The Tribe (x2) and maximizing Acrobat (x3). I'm sitting on three Aces (one Steel, two steel), a 10 of Diamonds (Polychrome), and a couple of other cards.\n\nMy immediate priority is to cycle cards. I can't discard since I'm out, and there's no way to make a big play right now. Since I can't make a good hand, I'm playing a junk hand now with the hope of drawing better suits for my final hand. So, my goal for this hand is to cycle out three cards. I'm keeping the Steel Aces and the Wild Card for now, and the Polychrome 10 as well.\n\nThe ideal is to build up toward a flush for the final hand, but honestly, even without a flush, the Acrobat multiplier combined with the Polychrome will be a big boost. I'll need to use this penultimate hand to increase my chances of having a winning hand. My instinct is that I need to be *strategic* to keep this going, so I want to draw some cards to get this.\n\nOkay, let's see. Playing a basic hand using those cycled cards with a High Card, Ace of Clubs. This should put some extra chips in the pot, while drawing new cards.\n\nI'm playing 2, 4, and 6, which gets me an estimated 3,055 chips. That *should* do the trick. The Wild Card (6 of Spades) stays put for the \"Planet\" card on the last hand. The next hand should be enough to meet the 52,500 target. I'll take a look at the math to be sure, and then get on with it!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,4,6]"}
