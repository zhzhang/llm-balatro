{"reasoning":"**Shop Decisions: A Flush of Thoughts**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6, Round 13, and the Boss Blind is looming. I've got $27 in the bank, raking in a solid $2 in interest for every $5 – a nice bump from \"To the Moon\". My Joker lineup is locked down: Odd Todd for chips on odd ranks, Abstract Joker cranking up the mult, To the Moon fueling my economy with both money and mult, Gift Card (the negative slot giving an extra slot), The Tribe multiplying my Flushes, and Acrobat waiting for the final hand x3 mult. My current strategy is a Flush focus, level 8, with an emphasis on odd cards to synergize with Odd Todd.\n\nIn the shop, I'm presented with: Certificate for $6, Banner for $5, and the Hone Voucher for $10. I also have $5 for a reroll, but I don't think I need one. Considering that I have a maxed-out Joker slot already, Gift Card with its negative modifier makes it a little unclear, but the game is stating max 6. The Gift Card adds another slot, for a total of 6 slots.\n\n*   Certificate: It adds a sealed card. It's great for the long game but I'm late in the run. If I pick this up, I need to sell something.\n*   Banner: Adds chips for discards, but Odd Todd is already handling chips really well with consistent odd cards.\n*   Hone: Higher chance for foils, but two Antes left. Not essential.\n*   Money: $27. If I buy, I could fall below $25, losing interest.\n\nNow, let's break down the potential: Odd Todd consistently generates around 93 chips with the right cards, while Banner offers similar value, but it's dependent on discards. I can't afford to get rid of my jokers.\n\nThe deck is solid. Certificate is the joker. Wait, I thought I had a negative slot? I can't add another joker if I'm at the max (6 slots). Gift Card is adding a negative slot, but it seems I'm at my limit. 5 (base) + 1 (negative edition) + 1 (gift card effect) = 7 max slots? No, I am at the limit of 6.\n\n*   Am I better off with any of these shop cards?\n    *   Certificate: It could add good cards, but it could bloat the deck too. Not essential.\n    *   Banner: Probably not.\n    *   Hone: Too expensive, with too little time.\n\nWith the current Jokers, the score is poised, and I should proceed to the next blind.\n\nNext round!\n\nWith the full round: I'll have $10 in interest.\n\n*   My Flush has the potential to score: Base score of 140 + ~93 (Odd Todd) + ~30 (Card values) = ~263 Chips\n*   Mult: Base 18 + Abstract 18 + To the Moon 10 = 46.\n*   X2 on The Tribe = 92\n*   Score: 263 Chips * 92 Mult = 24,196.\n*   Final hand: 24,196 * 3 (Acrobat) = 72,588. That should be enough for Ante 6.\n\n**Action: `round_select`**\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
