{"reasoning":"**Flush it is!**\n\nAlright, let's take a deep breath. Big Blind round 13, and the target is 30,000. Current chips: 27,600. Need 2,400 more to win. I've got a limited number of hands, only three, and one discard left. Okay, let's assess the cards and Jokers. Odd Todd is active, which is going to be helpful. Abstract Joker for the straight static Mult, and \"To the Moon\" Mult, and The Tribe (x2 Flush Mult). I have a Queen of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds, 8 of Diamonds, 4 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds.\n\nImmediately, I'm thinking: Flush! Diamonds, baby. A High Card hand wouldn't cut it. A High Card (9 of Diamonds) gets me a measly 1,305. Nope, not even close. Even a pair isn't an option.\n\nSo, let's fish for that Flush. I've got 5 Diamonds: 9, 8, 4, 3, 2. Let's run the numbers... base is 140 chips, 18 mult. Jokers take that to 46 mult, then x2 from The Tribe, so it's a whopping 92 mult. Now, add up the card chips: 9 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 26. Then, the Odd Todd effect: 9 and 3 give +31 each, so +62. 140 + 26 + 62 = 228 chips. 228 * 92 = 20,976. Bingo. This is enough to get me the remaining 2,400 I need.\n\nJust to be absolutely certain, let's play the math again... a flush, all Diamonds. Check. Base 140 chips, and I have the right cards: 9, 8, 4, 3, and 2. Odd Todd triggers on 9 and 3. The total is 228 chips. The mult: 18 base, +18 Abstract, +10 To the Moon. That's 46 Mult, doubled by The Tribe, for a total of 92 Mult. The score is 20,976. This clears my target by a wide margin.\n\nThere is also the Queen and 5 of Hearts, but that's not needed, and don't help. I could not go for the pair, as I don't have a matching pair.\n\nOkay, Flush it is! I'm playing the 9, 8, 4, 3, and 2 of Diamonds, positions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Hand: Flush. Estimated chips: 20976.\n\nJust one final review of the math: Odd Todd? Check. Mult? Check. Chips? Double-Check. This is a Flush, and the right cards are in the right positions.\n\nWait, should I wait for Acrobat? No, Acrobat's a x3 mult but only on the final hand. This isn't the final hand. I'd be earning dollars from the hands left, if I win now. And this win ensures my round, so no need to overthink it. Now is better.\n\nI have: Current chips 27,600. Need 2,400. This Flush earns 20,976, which is more than enough. Done! Now is better, as I have three hands left: play 1, so 2 remain.\n\nSo, play: flush, and let's win this round!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,7]"}
