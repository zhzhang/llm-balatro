{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Spectral Pack: The Flush Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 11, Ante 6/8, and staring down a Jumbo Spectral Pack with $20. The current Joker lineup is solid: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, and Acrobat. Six Jokers are active, with Gift Card giving us a bonus seventh slot. My strategy is a Flush build, heavily leaning on \"The Tribe,\" so hand size is *crucial*. I have level 5 Flush, so I need to find those suits!\n\nLet's break down the Spectral choices: Grim, Talisman, Ectoplasm, and Sigil.\n\n*   *Talisman* is meh, some extra cash is nice but not game-changing right now.\n*   *Sigil* is a suit converter, which is tempting for a Flush build but potentially situational. It’s a one-time thing, not an ongoing improvement. It does not look amazing.\n*   *Ectoplasm* is where things get interesting. It gives a Joker a Negative tag, which is powerful for unlocking a Joker slot. But that hand size reduction of -2? *Absolutely* not for my Flush strategy. Reducing hand size is the death knell for Flushes, it will make it exceedingly difficult to draw 5 cards of the same suit. My hand size might already be 7, or base 8, but -2 means a hand size of 5 or 6, and that is very difficult to draw flushes in!\n*   Which leaves us with *Grim*. Randomly destroying a card and adding two Enhanced Aces. Aces are Odd, which is huge because Odd Todd is active. Enhanced Aces would mean better cards, better for scoring and triggering Odd Todd!\n\nMy main consideration is the hand size reduction from Ectoplasm. It’s tempting for an extra Joker but a dead end for this build. The Tribe + Acrobat is my win condition. But I cannot do that if my hand size is too small.\n\nAces are odd, so Grim is the best choice. Grim is better than Sigil, because I have 7 cards in my hand and can play a flush now or next turn if I draw more of a particular suit!\n\nOkay, *Grim* it is. It's the safest and most consistent play for this Flush strategy. I am very confident on this pick. It also adds cards that synergize with an existing Joker (Odd Todd)!\n\nChecking the Joker order: Odd Todd, Abstract, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, Acrobat. Perfect. Multiplicative jokers (Tribe/Acrobat) are at the end. That means additive jokers will trigger first. The Gift Card placement is irrelevant, it does not apply to scoring.\n\nOkay, Grim is the best choice. I will pick Grim.\n\nAction: select 1.\n`{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
