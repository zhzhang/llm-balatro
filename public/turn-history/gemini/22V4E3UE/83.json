{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop - A Tough Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 9 of Ante 5/8, just finished the Standard Pack selection. I'm sitting on a measly $2. Let's see, my Joker situation is pretty solid: Odd Todd, Abstract, The Tribe, Gift Card (the negative one, but essential for slots), Acrobat, and To the Moon (that Holo one). I also have a Death consumable and the Telescope Voucher. My hand levels are decent, with Flush at Level 3. The strategy is Flush-focused, leaning on Odd Todd for chips, The Tribe for X2, and Acrobat for that huge X3 finish on the final hand. Abstract and To the Moon add nice multipliers.\n\nLooking at the Shop, I see Hanging Chad for $4, a Standard Pack for $4, and Magic Trick for a whopping $10. Reroll is $5. Unfortunately, with my $2, I can't buy *anything* outright. Selling my Death card only nets me $2, for a total of $4, so I could afford Hanging Chad or a Standard Pack, but is that a smart move?\n\nShould I sell Death and grab Hanging Chad? Well, it retriggers the first card 2 more times, which, with Odd Todd, could be a hefty 62 chips if I lead with an odd-ranked card. BUT, that means I'd have to ditch a Joker. Do I really want to replace any of my current jokers? Odd Todd is critical for chips, Abstract provides good flat mult, The Tribe is my key multiplier for the Flush strategy, Gift Card is vital for slots, Acrobat gives the huge finisher, and To The Moon keeps me in the money game with the interest and +10 Holo Mult. Hanging Chad seems like a downgrade at best, or maybe a side-grade depending on the hand.\n\nHow about selling Death for the Standard Pack? Nah, not worth giving up a Death card for a random card.\n\nAlright, with no money, and no good item to sell, the only logical action is to progress to the round select screen. Let's do that!\n```json\n{\"action\": \"round_select\"}\n```\nLooks good to me.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
