{"reasoning":"**The Path to Flush Perfection**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 7, at the Shop phase after the Small Blind, with $31 in my pocket. My primary goal is to maximize Flush scoring and money, and given my current setup, it looks like a calculated move is needed here. My Joker lineup is pretty solid: Odd Todd, Abstract, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, and Acrobat. I've also got the Hone and Telescope vouchers. My Flush is already Level 8, which is good, but I'm always looking for better.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the shop. Right now, I'm thinking, do I buy anything? Delayed Gratification is a no-go, I'm already using discards to find Flushes. Photograph is tempting (x2 multiplier on the first face card), but Odd Todd's chip generation is too valuable, plus I'd have to sell a Joker to make space. It's a trade-off I'm not ready for. The Mega Standard Pack or Standard Pack might be useful to level up, but are likely weak in most scenarios.\n\nOkay, back to the money situation. \"To the Moon\" gives fantastic interest ($2 per $5), so I should hoard cash. I'm getting $12 interest if I end the round now. I have Telescope, and I *really* want to level up the Flush through a Celestial Pack. A Reroll costs $5, so spending would be wasteful. I can only make $8 interest if I reroll, so I need to check the math.\n\nNow, let's consider the Big Blind and the Boss. I need to be sure I'll hit the scaling requirements and level up the Flush. A Mega Standard Pack might provide a useful seal or enhance my most common suits (Diamonds or Hearts) for a more consistent Flush. I have 16 Diamonds and 10 Hearts. But given the strong interest benefit, keeping my money is better. $12 in potential interest is significant, and I already have Telescope for a chance at a Jupiter card.\n\nLet's do a complete evaluation of the jokers. My current order is correct (Additive multipliers first, then multiplicative): Chips, Mult, Mult+Money, Sell value, x2, x3.\n\nGiven the potential interest, the current shop is not that great. I don't see any compelling cards or boosters here.\n\n*   Delayed Gratification: No.\n*   Photograph: Not better than Odd Todd.\n*   Standard Packs: Gambling.\n*   Reroll: Gambling, given the guaranteed Jupiter from Telescope.\n\nThe best move is `round_select` to maximize interest and shop for a Celestial Pack in the next round. And yes, Gift Card's sell value is already factored in, and the \"To the Moon\" interest is correct ($12). Proceeding to the next round seems obvious.\n\nOkay, is there *anything* else? I've checked the shop. Nothing is worth the money, considering the interest I will receive. The Mega Standard Pack has a small chance for a Diamond, but the Flush is already played 16 times!\n\n`Photograph` is very strong, but I will not sell `Odd Todd` for a situational multiplier. My best move is to save money, gain interest, and look for better deals in the next round. I'll stick to `round_select`.\n\nLet me do a double check on my calculation! A Flush with 3 odd cards is (140 + 31\\*3 + 40) \\* (18 + 18 + 10) \\* 2 = 273 \\* 46 \\* 2 = 25,116. If it's a final hand, it's 75,348. Ante 7 is 50,000, Ante 8 is 100,000. I am in good shape, but increasing Flush level is the priority. And yes, interest helps me find more packs.\n\nThe action is `round_select`.\n\n*   Is there any hidden value to the boosters?\n    *   A Red Seal on an odd-rank card would trigger Odd Todd twice!\n    *   Low probability.\n\nI'll take the interest.\n\nI have checked the shop. There is nothing to do other than maximize my money to reroll and hopefully find a Jupiter card. The action is `round_select`.\n\nI will do it now. The action is `round_select`.\n\nFinal check: `round_select` it is! The action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
