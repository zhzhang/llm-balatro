{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment and Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in round 13, facing a big blind of 30,000 chips, and I only have $23 to my name. I have a Flush strategy with a level 8 Flush (140 base chips, 18 mult). I've got 4/5 Diamonds already (Ace, 8, 5, 3), and with 13 Diamonds remaining in the 40-card deck, the odds are in my favor.\n\nI have some powerful Jokers in play: Odd Todd gives me +31 chips for each odd-rank card, Abstract Joker has +18 Mult per Joker, To the Moon gives +10 Mult (Holo), The Tribe doubles the multiplier on a Flush, and Acrobat triples the mult on the *final* hand of the round. My goal is to hit that 30,000 chip requirement.\n\nMy current hand contains the 10 of Spades, 8 of Spades, King of Clubs (a Bonus card, but not a diamond), Ace of Diamonds, 8 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds. The non-diamonds are clearly dead weight. I'm going to discard the 10 of Spades, 8 of Spades, and the King of Clubs (cards 1, 2, and 3). This gives me the best chance of getting that fifth Diamond and completing the Flush.\n\nThe probability of drawing at least one diamond from my three discards is pretty good, around 70%. If I hit the Flush, I'm looking at a decent chip yield: around 298 * 92 (Factoring in all the jokers = 27,416), which should be enough (although the Acrobat joker would have a bigger impact if this was the last round). This gives me the best odds to make a lot of chips and hit the goal of 30,000 chips. I need to get started with the discards.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"discard\", \"positions\": [1, 2, 3]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3]"}
