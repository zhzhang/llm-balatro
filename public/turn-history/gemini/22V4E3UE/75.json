{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Initial Hand: The Pillar Ante**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 4, Round 9. The current blind is Boss (The Pillar), meaning my first hand is drawn face down. My objective is 10,000 chips, and I have zero at the moment. I have four hands and four discards remaining.\n\nMy joker lineup is pretty solid: Odd Todd (additive chips), Abstract Joker (additive multiplier), The Tribe (flush multiplier), and a Gift Card, which is currently negative but will provide value at the end of the round. Then there's Acrobat (multiplies the final hand) and Death (card swapping).\n\nI've got seven cards in hand, all face down, indices 1 through 7. Flush is level 3, which is a good hand to aim for in most cases and given the jokers I have.\n\nGiven the \"The Pillar\" blind effect, I'm starting with a hand of unknowns. Playing blindly would be foolish. I have no information and Acrobat is useless this early. The optimal strategy, as always, with this blind is to discard the entire first hand to see what I'm working with. I can't trigger any synergies without that information.\n\nTherefore, I have to discard these face-down cards to gather some intel. The objective is to find a Flush. Since all cards are face down, there's no way to optimize. I need to get information. I need to discard cards.\n\nI can discard up to 5 cards. My current hand consists of indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. I'm going to discard the first five cards (indices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) to reveal a hand.\n\nSo, I'll go with the action: `{\"action\": \"discard\", \"positions\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}`. This maximizes information gathering at the minimum hand cost. I don't see any reason to play the initial hand since it's completely blind and risky. I also need to save those hands if a situation arises where I want to use Acrobat. Death is useless in the starting blind round. The joker order is good. Odd Todd first, Abstract Joker second, then The Tribe. The Gift Card will improve at the end of the round.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
