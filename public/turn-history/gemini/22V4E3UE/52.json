{"reasoning":"**Boss Blind Ante 3: Ready to Roll**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the `BLIND_SELECT` phase for the Boss Blind of Ante 3, which requires 4,000 chips. The Boss effect is a nasty -1 hand size, but I'm thinking, I'm well-equipped to handle this.\n\nLet's quickly review the Joker situation: I have Odd Todd, which adds chips for odd ranks, Abstract Joker, currently at +15 Mult per Joker, Turtle Bean which provides a crucial +3 hand size (net +2 because of the boss effect), The Tribe, for that juicy x2 Mult on Flushes, and Gift Card, which is nice but not crucial right now. I also have The Hanged Man consumable, and a Telescope voucher. My Flush is already level 3, earning 65 chips, 8 mult.\n\nMy last Flush scored a hefty 7,498, easily exceeding the 4,000 chip target.  The hand size is effectively 10, given the Turtle Bean's help, which just makes getting that Flush even *easier*.\n\nI'm checking the available commands; `play_round` is right there. No preparation is needed. I'll make sure the jokers are correctly arranged, with additive multipliers like Abstract Joker before multiplicative ones like The Tribe. Currently, they're 1. Odd Todd, 2. Abstract Joker, 3. Turtle Bean, 4. The Tribe, 5. Gift Card. That's the correct order: chips, additive mult, then multiplicative mult. The Gift Card isn't needed right now. I have The Hanged Man, but it's used during the round on cards. I'll need to wait for that.\n\nI'm going to start the round. The goal is 4,000 chips. Based on the last score, that's not going to be a problem. My single flush should take this boss down. No reason to sell anything either. I can handle the $2 interest.\n\nAlright, the action is `play_round`. No specific card positions, hand type or estimated chips are needed. Let's get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
