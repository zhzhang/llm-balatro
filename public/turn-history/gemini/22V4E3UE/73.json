{"reasoning":"**Shop Decision Time: Flush Strategy in Focus**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 4, Round 8, in the shop phase. I've got $6. Let's see... Inventory: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, The Tribe, Gift Card (negative), and Acrobat. Death card as a consumable, plus a Telescope voucher. The shop options are Ride the Bus, a Jumbo Standard Pack, and a Tarot Merchant (which is out of reach).\n\nI *could* sell the Death card, but that feels wrong. I should be able to use it strategically in the boss round. Rearranging Jokers... nope, the current order is optimal for my Flush strategy: Odd Todd first for chips, then Abstract Joker for the +Mult boost, The Tribe to multiply that, Gift Card as a utility, and finally Acrobat at the end to multiply the whole shebang. Base * Abstract * Tribe * Acrobat is the way.\n\nRight, so with $6, I can buy the Jumbo Standard Pack or Ride the Bus (which is useless since I'm going for Flushes). A reroll would leave me with $1, not ideal.\n\nHere's the rub: a Standard Pack *might* give me a crucial club card, odd-rank card, or an enhanced card. However, the interest from saving my money for one round is $1, which is not bad. If I buy the pack, it's $0. If I go to the next round, I have $7. Plus, I just used an Arcana pack on the previous turn.\n\nLet's think about the upcoming boss blind, \"The Pillar.\" It draws the first hand face down which complicates hand selection. This means that having more cards to select from in the deck will be valuable (especially clubs). However, a single card from a standard pack is unlikely to have a huge impact.\n\nGiven my setup – flushes, the Death card ready, and the Boss Blind impending – I'm leaning towards the next round. But should I really purchase that Standard Pack? No, the Jumbo Standard Pack isn't likely worth it. Should I reroll? No. Should I buy the bus? No.\n\nThe Telescope voucher won't help here since there are no Celestial Packs. Let's look at that Gift Card again. It adds sell value to Jokers and Consumables at the end of the round. Current money: $6. I should go to `round_select`.\n\nHang on, let's do the math. The Tribe and Acrobat are going to give a HUGE mult on my final hand. I have Odd Todd, Abstract Joker is at +15, The Tribe adds a x2 and Acrobat a x3. Flush Level 3 is 65 Chips, 8 Mult. My calculated score with 3 odd cards: (65 + 31*3) * (8+15)*2 = 158 * 23 * 2 = 7268 chips on a non-final hand. The final hand: 7268 * 3 = 21804. Ante 4 Boss Blind typically needs 15,000 to 20,000. I'm in a great position!\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\n$6 now or $7 later plus a round reward? I don't need a weak Standard Pack right now.\n\nWith the Boss Blind's face-down hand, I may need multiple hands or careful discards, and a Standard Pack is unlikely to give me the exact card I need. I'm going for round select.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\nWait, just a double-check on Joker order...Odd Todd, Abstract, Tribe, Gift, Acrobat. Yep, that's still right.\n\nLet's just confirm. Tarot Merchant is out. Standard pack is $6. Reroll is $5. No need to look further. `round_select`.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\nOne last sanity check. Still, let me reconsider the Standard Pack. Nah. The interest is more valuable at this stage.\n\nOh, the Death card. I will save this for the Boss Round.\n\nFinal Result: `{\"action\": \"round_select\"}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
