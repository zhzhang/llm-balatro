{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here we go. I'm staring down the barrel of a `STANDARD_PACK`, a Jumbo Standard Pack, which means some interesting choices are probably in store. I have to pick one of five cards, and I need to be smart about this. Let's break it down:\n\n*   **Choice 1:** The 2 of Clubs. Nope. Even rank, wrong suit. Not good for what I'm aiming for. Pass.\n*   **Choice 2:** 7 of Diamonds. Now we're talking! This is an odd rank (hello, Odd Todd!), it's in a suit I'm building around, and it's a \"Lucky Card\" with the chance of a Multiplier or even some money. This is very promising.\n*   **Choice 3:** 6 of Hearts. Even rank. Another miss. Moving on.\n*   **Choice 4:** 5 of Hearts (Wild). Also odd, which works with Odd Todd. It's also a Wild Card, meaning I can use it as any suit. Very interesting.\n*   **Choice 5:** 5 of Hearts. Just odd rank, which works with Odd Todd. Good, but nothing special.\n\nRight, so the strategy here is heavy Flushes and Odd ranks. I've played Flushes 12 times before, so this is a solid build. Looking at the possible synergies: I have `Odd Todd`, `Abstract Joker`, `To the Moon`, `The Tribe`, and `Acrobat`. The best cards are going to be Odd and suit-specific, with the most flexibility.\n\nSo, it's down to Choices 2 and 4. 7 of Diamonds vs. 5 of Hearts (Wild). Both are odd for Odd Todd, and both play nicely with my Flush strategy. This is a tough call. I've seen the deck distribution, there's an equal distribution of Diamonds and Hearts, and the Wild card is going to be helpful in most cases.\n\nLet's see: the \"7 of Diamonds\" will give me a boost with Odd Todd, and it's in the suit I need. The \"5 of Hearts (Wild)\" gives me maximum flexibility for any flush. However, the Wild card is vulnerable to boss blinds that debuff suits. Hmmm...\n\nUltimately, a \"Lucky\" card is really good, as I am not looking for a specific steel/glass build. The \"7 of Diamonds (Lucky Card)\" seems like the best play: an odd rank, a suit that fits the deck's preference, and the potential for a Lucky proc! This is it.\n\nOkay, let's select that card.\n`select 2`\n`action`: \"select\"\n`positions`: \\[2]\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
