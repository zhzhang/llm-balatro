{"reasoning":"**My Assessment: Skip the Small Blind for Optimal Economy and Boss Preparation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm in the Small Blind phase, and the math is clear: I need to decide between taking the *Handy Tag* skip reward ($10) versus playing the round. This tag is basically free money, right?  The current situation is tight. I've only got $2 in the bank, and my Jokers are set up for a Flush strategy, leaning into \"The Tribe\" for that juicy X2 multiplier on Flushes. I have \"To the Moon\", and the math shows me that rearranging Jokers can be optimal, but I can do that later.\n\nMy initial thought was the round is doable, and \"Gift Card\" will give me money, but that looks like a trap because the immediate $10 from skipping is more valuable right now, considering I need cash for shops and interest-building for \"To the Moon\".\n\nThe Boss is a Spade debuff. *That's* the key. If I skip, I'm down to one shop to find a solution (like a Suit changer or just focusing on Diamonds). If I play the Small Blind, I get two. I am torn. However, the value of the handy tag and cash in a fast-paced economy is strong.  Right now, $10 is *much* better than ~$6 and the uncertain future sell value of the \"Gift Card\".\n\nThe *Handy Tag* is my priority. It's a quick $10! Plus, I have a *Death* card and can still find solutions.\n\nI'm confident in skipping and prepping for the Big Blind to manage the Spades debuff! I will arrange jokers.\n\nThe schema says I have to skip now, then I will.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
