{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Decision Making**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 3, Round 4, in the shop phase. I've only got $2, a full Joker lineup with some decent options, and The Hanged Man consumable. The shop is offering items that are all out of my price range: Marble Joker, Arcana Pack, and Telescope Voucher. Reroll is also too expensive.\n\nThe Hanged Man looks tempting, but I can't actually *use* it in the shop. It requires targeting cards in my hand or deck, and right now, the game interface doesn't show me those cards. I've got to remember that the game is digital and that I can't target cards to destroy until I'm in a round or I've received a pack with it as a choice.\n\nSince I can't afford anything and can't use the Hanged Man, the obvious move is to progress to the next phase. The command is `round_select` to exit the shop. It's a simple, straightforward action, no arguments needed.\n\nNow, before committing, I'm checking my options for selling Jokers. Zany Joker is tempting to ditch because I'm Flush-focused (The Tribe). Selling Zany would net me $2, which would bring me to $4. Could I get an Arcana Pack then? Zany provides +12 Mult to Full Houses, which I will not play. Abstract Joker gets +15 Mult (+3 per joker); if I sold Zany, that would become +12. This is a potential -15 Mult loss if I sell Zany to then play a Full House. Is the risk worth it?\n\nThe Arcana Pack *might* offer a better Joker or some immediate cash/chip boost, but it's a gamble. I have to think about long-term strategy and what's best, and right now, with only $2, I should probably just build up my money and interest.\n\nAlso, I have to consider Turtle Bean. It is temporary (+4 hand size, reduces every round).\n\nOkay, after thinking it through, I'm sticking with the original plan: I'll use the `round_select` command. No point in risking it. I'm done shopping.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
