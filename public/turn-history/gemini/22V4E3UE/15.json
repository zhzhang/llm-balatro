{"reasoning":"**Current Ante and Shop Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. It's Ante 2, and I've got $15 to work with. The shop's offering a few things, and I need to make a solid call to set myself up for the long haul. Currently, I'm holding Zany Joker, which gives a +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, and The Tribe, a x2 Mult for Flushes – nice pickup from a Rare Tag. No consumables yet.\n\nThe shop has the *Business Card* ($4), which is decent for the economy since I have Kings and Jacks; the *Celestial Pack* ($4) which I like to level up hands; a *Buffoon Pack* ($4) for more Jokers; and the *Crystal Ball* ($10) which I'm not touching for now.\n\nMy scoring potential right now is looking at either 3 of a Kind/Full House with the Zany or a straight Flush with The Tribe. I need to make a strategic decision to build upon the strengths I already have. The Tribe and Zany Joker don't play nicely together unless I'm going for Flush House, but they are decent placeholders.\n\nMy initial thought was to prioritize the economy and the Business Card looks reasonable for that, but early scoring is often better, especially when I'm still setting up. Then I thought the Celestial Pack looked good because leveling up hand types is a permanent buff, not tied to a Joker slot.\n\nI know I want to keep at least $10 for decent interest. Spending $4 lets me keep $11 with $2 interest, but spending $8 is less desirable.\n\nSo, the play here seems to be to go for the *Buffoon Pack* first to see if I can find a Joker that synergizes with either a Flush or a 3-of-a-Kind build. A \"Half Joker\" or something that adds chips would be ideal. I want to keep my options open.\n\nI'm thinking, standard strategy, buy the Buffoon pack and see. I can always sell it if the Jokers aren't great. *No, no no!* Let's buy the Buffoon Pack. And then, since they both cost $4, I can still get the Celestial pack. Let's start with the Buffoon Pack. Wait! Since I just bought The Tribe (Flush), my deck is standard, Flushes are easy to fish for. And, the prompt wants an action. Okay, Buffoon Pack it is.\n\nLet's check the Business Card again. Face cards 1 in 2 for $2. Okay economy. Still buy Buffoon.\n\nI've got this.\nThe action is `buy_booster 2`.\nThe final decision is: `buy_booster 2`!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
