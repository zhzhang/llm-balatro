{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current Round and Optimal Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6, small blind at 20,000 chips. I've got $20, and a solid Flush setup: a Level 5 Flush, Tribe (x2), To the Moon (Holo +10 Mult), Abstract (+18 Mult), and Odd Todd (+31 chips per card). I'm holding Gift Card too, which adds $1 sell value per Joker *at the end of the round*. Acrobat gives me x3 mult on the final hand.\n\nThe immediate choice is whether to play the Small Blind or skip it for an Investment Tag ($25 after the Boss). Let's break it down: Playing the Small Blind yields roughly $11-12 from the base, interest, and hand rewards. Skipping gives $25 later.\n\nMy primary driver is *shop access*, specifically the Telescope. I need to see what's available and level up my cards; the recent Spectral pack might provide needed adjustments. If I play the Small Blind, I get a shop immediately. If I skip, I go straight to the Big Blind. This has consequences: the Gift Card, if not played, will not scale the Jokers.\n\nGiven my current strength, I'm confident my Flush can surpass the 20,000 chips needed for the blind. I just have to place the cards in the right order.\n\nNow, let's consider the Investment Tag. $25 is appealing, but I'm concerned about the missed opportunity for immediate scaling through shop access. The shop is crucial for continued growth.\n\nBut wait, the Gift Card! If I skip, I'm missing out on that $6 scaling from my Jokers, which *really* tips the scales.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action is `play_round`. This grants me the shop access and the Gift Card scaling. The $5 difference from the Investment Tag is a poor trade-off for shop access.\n\nI will start by arranging my Jokers in this order: Odd Todd, Abstract, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, and Acrobat.\n\nThis translates to a final decision for a JSON response, which should be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"play_round\"}\n```\nI'll go with that.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
