{"reasoning":"**Round 8 Strategy: The Pillar**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 4, Round 8, facing \"The Pillar\" in Blind Select. My immediate focus is hitting that 10,000 chip target. The boss effect, the first hand is drawn face down, doesn't scare me – I can still choose to play it or discard it. I have $6 and a pretty solid setup.\n\nI'm riding the Flush strategy again. I've been hitting consistent scores, usually in the 10k-11k range per hand. I have a Flush Level 3, giving me 65 chips and 8 multiplier. The Acrobat joker provides X3 on the *final* hand. I really like this because the multiplier will be applied at the end of the round, no matter what.\n\nMy Joker lineup is pretty strong:\n\n1.  Odd Todd (+31 Chips on odd ranks) - Additive Chips.\n2.  Abstract Joker (+15 Mult) - Additive Mult.\n3.  The Tribe (X2 Mult for hands with a Flush) - Multiplicative Mult, which will be strong this round.\n4.  Gift Card (+1 Joker slot) - Not as helpful right now, as it gives me a negative.\n5.  Acrobat (X3 Mult on the *final* hand) - Multiplicative Mult.\n\nI have a \"Death\" consumable. I could use it, but...it only lets me convert cards. I think I will hold onto this for now.\n\nLet's quickly check my setup to ensure I will hit the target.\n\nI need to make sure my mult order is correct. I always need to calculate additive mult, then multiplicative mult. The current order is fine, with both Tribe and Acrobat being multiplicative. Multiplication order doesn't change the outcome, so I am good there.\n\nI am ready. I'll take a deep breath and start the round.\n\nAction: `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
