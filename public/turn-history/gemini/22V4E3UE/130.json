{"reasoning":"**My Analysis of the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, Round 13, facing the BLIND_SELECT boss. We're looking at a need of 40,000 chips. The description \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\" is the key. While the text is a little ambiguous, it points to a mechanic that makes some or all cards face down, and given the available information, this is likely \"The Pillar\" mechanic.\n\nI have $27 to work with, and a decent joker setup: Odd Todd for chip generation, Abstract Joker and To the Moon for additive mult, The Tribe for x2 flush mult, Acrobat for x3 final hand mult, and the Gift Card (which I'll need to sell later but has no bearing on this play). My Flush hand is level 8, giving me 140 chips and 18 mult to start.\n\nThe crucial issue is the face-down cards. This *hurts* my ability to consistently form Flushes, which is my primary path to victory given The Tribe. Acrobat's x3 is only on the *final* hand, so building to that will be important.\n\nI need to quickly assess whether my joker order is optimal. Odd Todd goes first or during scoring, and additive mults come before multiplicative mults. It looks like the order of: Odd Todd, Abstract, To the Moon, Gift Card, The Tribe, Acrobat is already the optimal order.\n\nI can't use consumables, sell Jokers right now, or rearrange anything. With this setup, the only logical step is to start the round. No further analysis is needed. Let's play.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
