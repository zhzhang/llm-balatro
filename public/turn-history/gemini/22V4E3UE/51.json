{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the SHOP phase of Ante 3, Round 5. I've got $10, which means I'll get $2 interest if I don't spend. The shop's empty – no cards, boosters, or vouchers worth grabbing. I've got The Hanged Man, but that's a round-time tool. I can't use it or sell it now.\n\nMy Jokers are Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, Turtle Bean, The Tribe, and Gift Card. I've got a solid hand, and a Flush level 3. I'm focusing on optimization, and the order is: (Base Chips + Card Chips + Odd Todd) * (Base Mult + Abstract) * (The Tribe x2). So, I'll rearrange Abstract and Tribe. Abstract needs to go before The Tribe for optimal scoring (Additive, then Multiplicative).\n\nRerolling the shop feels like a waste. It costs $5, leaving me with limited funds for anything good it might uncover. I can't even afford to buy anything great. I'm already in a strong position, so no need to take a risk here.\n\nSelling anything is out of the question for now.\n\nThe smartest move is to hit `round_select` and get to the next blind. No need to overthink it; no positional arguments are required here. My plan is set!\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
