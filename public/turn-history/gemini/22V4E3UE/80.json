{"reasoning":"**Round 9 Shop Phase Optimization**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 5, and I have $14 to play with. My current Joker setup is solid: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, The Tribe, Gift Card (negative), and Acrobat. I'm leveraging a Flush strategy, and my most-played hand is Level 3 Flush (65 base chips, 8 mult). My goal is to maximize score and build for the later Antes.\n\nLooking at the shop, \"To the Moon\" (Holo) is immediately catching my eye. It's $8, and it promises +10 Mult, *plus* the interest boost, which is crucial for long-term economy. With Abstract Joker already providing +3 Mult per Joker, that Holo bonus on \"To the Moon\" will be a substantial multiplier increase and help me build money. I also have \"Hanging Chad\" which re-triggers the first card - if the first card is Odd, it triggers Odd Todd again (adding +31 chips). It's only $4.\n\n\"To the Moon\" seems like the clear first choice, doubling the interest earned and adding +10 Holo mult. That means Abstract's Mult will jump from +15 to +18 (15 + 3 = 18), and then the Holo from To the Moon will add another +10 for a total of +28 Mult. Excellent!\n\nMy current setup has 5 Jokers, but with the Gift Card's negative effect, I effectively have 6 slots. So, buying \"To the Moon\" means I'll have a full set of 6 Jokers.\n\nThe \"Hanging Chad\" Joker is interesting because with Odd Todd, re-triggering the first card could lead to a massive chip gain (93 chips total). But I have to optimize *now*. \"To the Moon\" boosts the economy and gives a +10 Mult directly. The Holo card means +10 Mult from the start.\n\n\"Magic Trick\" is tempting, but with my current setup, a guaranteed Holo Joker with economy is better. Standard packs are $4, but are not guaranteed.\n\nOkay, I'm buying \"To the Moon\" (Holo) for $8. That leaves me with $6. Then I should buy a Standard Pack with my remaining money. The Death card I have in inventory is better used during a round to clone a high-value card.\n\nAction: `buy_card`\nPosition: 2 (To the Moon)\nEstimated Chips: N/A (Shop phase)\nAction: `buy_card`\nPosition: Standard Pack\nEstimated Chips: N/A (Shop Phase)\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
