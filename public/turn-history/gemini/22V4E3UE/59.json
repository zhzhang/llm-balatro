{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Play**\n\nOkay, here we are in the shop phase of Ante 4, Round 6. I've got a Flush at level 3, which is a solid foundation. My immediate concern is my paltry $5. I need to figure out the best use of this limited resource and optimize my Joker setup. Let's break this down.\n\nCurrently I have six Jokers: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, Turtle Bean, The Tribe, Gift Card, and Acrobat. My goal is to maximize my score in this round by playing Flushes.\n\nI can't afford the Jumbo Standard Pack or the Tarot Merchant, and a reroll is out of the question.\n\nThe only option is Mystic Summit, which costs $5. It adds +15 Mult when I have 0 discards, and I can currently afford it.  If I buy Mystic Summit, I need to sell a Joker. Odd Todd is worth $3 if I sell it. If I sell Odd Todd, I'd have a net loss of chips in the short term, but I'd have +15 Mult. I need to evaluate the trade-off.\n\nLet's look at the numbers. My current hand has a Flush base of 65 chips. Odd Todd provides around +93 chips. Abstract Joker gives +18 mult and The Tribe gives X2 mult.  So my current rough estimate for this is ~8216. If I replace Odd Todd with Mystic Summit, that changes the mult to 41 for a score of ~5330. So I'm pretty certain Odd Todd is the better choice. I can always play some low value cards, and not discard, if Mystic Summit is worth it later. It is worth it in the long run.\n\nNow, Gift Card is adding $1 sell value to all my Jokers, so that's like a free $6 at the end of the round. Interest is $1 for every $5. I am broke but will get $1.\n\nMy Joker order is currently Odd Todd, Abstract, Turtle Bean, The Tribe, Gift Card, Acrobat. It's a good order. Odd Todd applies chips, then Abstract, then The Tribe (X2), then Acrobat (X3).\n\nSo the plan: keep the $5. Play the hand. Let's go!\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
