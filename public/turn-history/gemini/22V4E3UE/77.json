{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current Round**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4, Round 9. My primary goal is 10,000 chips. The Boss Blind, \"The Pillar,\" is already dealt with – no immediate concerns there. I have four hands left, and two discards available. My current money is a paltry $6. The Joker lineup is key: Odd Todd (which is going to be helpful here!), Abstract Joker (for that sweet mult!), The Tribe (for the Flush multiplier), Gift Card (ugh, a negative, but with a Joker slot!), and the Acrobat (X3 on the final hand!).\n\nMy hand is: 10 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs. Looking at this, it's clear: I have a flush! Clubs, baby! Flush Level 3, with 65 base chips and 8 base mult.\n\nThe flush cards are 9, 8, 7, 4, and 2 of Clubs. Odd Todd triggers on 9 and 7, which is a nice little bonus. Calculating the chips, I have 65 base, 30 from the card values, and 62 from Odd Todd (31 * 2 for the two odd ranks). Total chips: 157. The base mult is 8, plus 15 from the Abstract Joker, giving a total additive mult of 23. Then the Tribe doubles it due to the Flush, for a total of 46. This hand will score 157 * 46 = 7,222 chips.\n\n*Wait a minute.* I need 10,000. 7,222 isn't enough to clear the round *unless* I use the Acrobat on my *final* hand.\n\nShould I try to discard to chase better Odd Todd cards? The ideal Odd Todd ranks are A, 9, 7, 5, and 3. I already have the 9 and 7. There are only five Clubs left in the deck. I only have two discards remaining. If I play this flush now, I score around 7,222. That leaves 2,778 chips to find. If I play this hand, I will have three remaining, but the Acrobat will be there for the final hand to guarantee the 10,000 chip target.\n\nI can use the \"Death\" consumable. It lets me select two cards, and the leftmost becomes the rightmost. Right now, there isn't anything in particular I need. I already have a flush, but I could clone a useful card if I was fishing, which I am not.\n\nOkay, so the play is clear. I'm going to play the flush hand, and use the Acrobat on the final hand. I'll discard the flush cards: 9C, 8C, 7C, 4C, 2C. Total chip calculation is: (65 base + 30 cards + 62 Todd) * (8 base + 15 Abstract) * 2 (Tribe) = 157 * 23 * 2 = 7,222. Since the target is 10,000, I will definitely need a second hand.\n\n**Action: `play`**\n\n**Positions: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`**\n\n**Hand Type: `flush`**\n\n**Estimated Chips: `7222`**\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,7]"}
