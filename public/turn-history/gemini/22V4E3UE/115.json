{"reasoning":"**Focusing on Flush Reinforcement**\n\nAlright, let's see where we are. It's round 12, ante 6/8. I've got $27, and I'm still riding this Flush strategy. The Jumbo Celestial Pack gave me a good foundation: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker is a great multi, To The Moon for that extra interest, Gift Card adds a joker slot, and The Tribe which is a total must-have with the Flush x2, and Acrobat for some extra chips. My Flush level is at 6 currently.\n\nThe booster pack offers a few planets: Jupiter, Earth, Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Given the Telescope Voucher and my Flush-centric build, Jupiter is the clear first choice. It directly levels up the Flush, reinforcing the core strategy. There's no reason to deviate here. Selecting anything else would be a misstep.\n\nSo, the action is `select 1`, which is the position of Jupiter. I don't need to consider any specific hand type or cards; this is about immediate hand type reinforcement. The chips are irrelevant here. This is a straightforward choice to maximize the Flush build.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
