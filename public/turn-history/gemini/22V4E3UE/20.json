{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Ante 2, Round 2 - Skip or Play the Small Blind?**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 2, Round 2. Small Blind of 800 chips. Big Blind is 1200, and the Boss Blind is 1600, with a \"one hand type\" restriction, which is actually beneficial for my current build! I'm sitting on $7, and my Joker setup is heavily favoring Flushes (The Tribe at x2 Mult) and Three of a Kind (Zany Joker at +12 Mult). Odd Todd adds some support with odd-numbered cards. Flush is already Level 2.\n\nI have a Meteor Tag, which lets me skip the Small Blind and get a Mega Celestial Pack. This is a crucial decision point.\n\nOn one hand, skipping gives me a free Mega Celestial Pack (2 Planet cards). That could be HUGE for scaling. I'm thinking I can level up my Flush even further, which synergizes directly with \"The Tribe\". Leveling up Three of a Kind with the second planet card is also an option, but the focus is clearly on Flush right now. The blinds themselves are relatively low chip requirements, easily achievable with a Level 2 Flush plus Odd Todd.\n\nBut playing the Small Blind has its own perks. I'd earn $3, plus whatever hand rewards I get. Crucially, I'd get to hit the Shop after the Small Blind. This is vital for finding new Jokers, Vouchers, or building my economy. More money means more interest, a compounding advantage.\n\nHowever, a quick calculation reveals that a single Flush (Level 2: 50 chips, 6 mult) with even two odd cards (e.g., 9 and 7) should easily clear the blinds. With Odd Todd, that's already around 1440 chips! And my hand will be multiplied by the x2 from \"The Tribe\". Easy. I can clear the blinds no problem.\n\nThe Meteor Tag and the Mega Celestial Pack are incredibly valuable. Usually, a Celestial Pack costs $4. A Mega pack is worth significantly more because I get to select two planet cards for a guaranteed power spike. Given my synergy with \"The Tribe,\" leveling up Flush is very powerful, and increasing the base mult and chips is multiplicative with the x2. Skipping for the Meteor Tag is typically a strong play early on when I'm focused on a specific hand.\n\nThinking more deeply, I remember I just bought a Celestial Pack to get Flush to Level 2. So, if I skip now, I guarantee more levels, and that's a high value play. The Shop is tempting, but the Meteor Tag is a \"guaranteed\" power spike for my current build.\n\nThe Boss Blind \"one hand type\" condition is exactly what I need right now.\n\nThe logic solidifies: Meteor Tag equals Mega Celestial Pack, which equals choosing two planet cards. That provides significant scaling. I can't pass up this guaranteed power boost. It's the right play to push this build to its full potential.\n\nSo, I'm going with: `skip_round`. The Meteor Tag is the optimal move here!\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
