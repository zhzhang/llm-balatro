{"reasoning":"**Reroll Decision Time**\n\nOkay, Ante 7, Round 14. $34 in the bank. My goal is to beat this Ante/Boss with my Flush-focused build (currently Level 8 with 140 chips and 18 mult). My Joker lineup is solid: Odd Todd for chips, Abstract Joker for mult, To the Moon for a nice interest bonus (and holo buff), Gift Card (negative but with a slot boost), The Tribe for x2 on Flushes, and Acrobat for x3 on the final hand. I'm prioritizing stacking mult to maximize the output, with additive jokers before multiplicative ones.\n\nThe current shop is a bit lackluster. Fortune Teller (+9 mult) isn't as good as what I have. Pluto is useless for a flush build. Hone ($10, boosts enhanced card frequency) could be interesting for the long run, but I'm late in the game. I really want to find more Planet cards (specifically Jupiter) to level up my Flush. Reroll ($5) is an option.\n\nInterest calculations are crucial. \"To the Moon\" gives me an extra $1 interest for every $5 I have at the end of the round. Regular interest is $1 per $5. So at $34, I'm getting $12 interest. This means I want to stay above $25 to maximize this bonus. Losing $5 on a reroll is acceptable.\n\nSince I already bought an Arcana pack, rerolling the shop seems like the best move here. It's a gamble, but I'm looking for a better Joker or, ideally, a Planet pack. I have the money.\n\nSo, the play is to reroll. I checked again, and I confirm Hone's bonus might not provide much value at this stage. I confirm I do not need to rearrange my Jokers for best stacking, either.\n\nReroll shop action is the best option now.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
