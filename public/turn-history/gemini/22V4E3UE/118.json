{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Ante 6 Shop**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 6, Round 12, just finished the shop phase. I've got $23, which with \"To the Moon\", gives me $4 in interest. My Joker setup is pretty solid for a Flush build: Odd Todd for chips on odd ranks, Abstract for the flat Mult, To the Moon for that sweet Holo Mult and interest boost, The Tribe for the Flush multiplier, Acrobat for the final hand x3, and Gift Card as a free slot (although negative). My Flush is already at Level 8.\n\nThe shop itself isn't offering anything that really *jumps* out. Walkie Talkie doesn't fit the build at all. Riff-raff is useless because I'm full on Jokers. Hone is tempting for editions, but at this point in the game, it might not be the best use of $10.\n\nI'm considering a few things: Should I reroll? It would cost $5, and I could potentially land a Jupiter (planet), a better Joker to replace Odd Todd or Abstract, or some Tarot cards to make my Flushes more consistent. But I'm pretty comfortable with what I have.\n\nSaving for interest is another option, as \"To the Moon\" is boosting my interest gains significantly. I'll get $4 interest now, which is a good return for holding onto the cash. I'm already past the usual $20 cap, too.\n\nThe current plan is to conserve the interest, and go to `round_select` to move to the next blind. The build is very stable. I'm not seeing any real power-up potential in the shop, which favors holding onto the money. I'm already in a very strong position to clear the Blind.\n\nI did a quick review of Joker placement and trigger order to be sure, and my current setup is optimal for maximizing the Abstract (+Mult), To the Moon (Holo +Mult) multipliers, and tribe + Acrobat multipliers.\n\nI also double-checked the Gift Card; it's just a passive income booster, which makes it good to hold.\n\nTherefore, the best action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
