{"reasoning":"**Balatro Decision: Ectoplasm over Immolate**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm at Ante 4, Round 6, Spectral Pack time. I've got $16 in the bank, five jokers (full house!), and no consumables. The Spectral Pack gives me a tough choice: Ectoplasm or Immolate. Ectoplasm gives a new joker slot but -1 hand size. Immolate gives $20 and deck thinning but randomly destroys 5 cards.\n\nMy Jokers are: Odd Todd (replaceable), Abstract (good for now), Turtle Bean (temporary hand size boost, but decaying), The Tribe (x2 Flush mult, absolutely vital), and Gift Card (scaling sell value).\n\nMy strategy is flushes, so thinning the deck is generally good, and The Tribe is my key. I am currently running a good hand with 10 cards.\n\nOriginally I was leaning towards Immolate for the cash injection, but then I remember Ectoplasm is rarer. But looking at the hand I'm holding, 3 Spades. Immolate could destroy my Spades, which I need for Flushes!\n\nThe Ectoplasm choice gives me a sixth joker slot. Yes, -1 hand size is painful, but the extra joker slot is usually the \"win condition\" move in high-ante runs of Balatro. And I can live with the hit. Turtle Bean is at +2 hand size right now, decaying, so I'll be at a net of 7 with Ectoplasm. Even with my reduced hand size, level 3 Flush and The Tribe will still be scoring.\n\nSo, I was ready to go with Immolate for a moment. $20 would take me to $36, but then I remembered that an extra joker is *always* good. I need to make sure I don't need to sell a Joker first. No, Ectoplasm works on existing Jokers. Immolate would give me an influx of cash for rerolls or Celestial packs, but I need that Joker Slot.\n\nEctoplasm's description says \"-1 hand size\". It's a permanent reduction. I *think* that last round's boss reduced hand size, but that's over now. So base hand size is 8. Turtle Bean adds +2 for 10. Ectoplasm is the Spectral card, the standard.\n\nI need to confirm the schema one more time! The `select` command for boosters is: `select <pack_card_position>`. So my final decision is Ectoplasm, which is position 1.\n\nThe extra Joker slot, and the permanent negative is the win condition. Let's do it!\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
