{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Game Plan: Secure the Free Rare Joker**\n\nAlright, let's break down this round. Ante 2/8, Round 2, SHOP phase. I've got $15, a Zany Joker that boosts my Three of a Kind Multiplier, and I need to make some strategic purchases. The key here is to maximize score *and* maintain a solid economy for future rounds.\n\nMy inventory is as follows:\n\n*   Jokers: Zany Joker (+12 Mult for 3OAK)\n*   Consumables: None\n*   Tags: None (Rare Tag was used)\n*   Vouchers: None\n*   Money: $15\n\nHere's what the shop offers:\n\n*   **Card 1:** The Tribe (Rare, $0) - X2 Multi if hand contains a Flush. This is the obvious starting point, it's free due to the Rare Tag. It is worth it to consider how much this Rare Joker will help versus the Zany Joker I already have.\n*   **Card 2:** Business Card ($4) - Face cards have 1 in 2 chance for $2. Economic option, but not quite as important early.\n*   **Booster 1:** Celestial Pack ($4) - Hand level ups. This is a nice-to-have, to boost the overall quality of my hands.\n*   **Booster 2:** Buffoon Pack ($4) - More Jokers. Always good, but depends on my current strategy.\n*   **Voucher 1:** Crystal Ball ($10) - Adds a consumable slot. Not a priority right now.\n\nMy current hand levels are at Full House level 1.\n\nThe Tribe is an absolute must-buy, it's free. It's an X2 multiplier for Flushes. Even though the Zany Joker is focused on Three of a Kinds, this rare joker is worth having, and is also flexible enough for a switch later. I'll buy that first.\n\nSo, first action: I'll buy \"The Tribe\" at position 1, it costs me $0. This seems the most logical first step, the free Rare Joker will be a good early addition.\n\nI need to make sure I format the action correctly.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_card\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\nOkay, I think that's right. The logic checks out. Buy the free Joker first.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
