{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Optimizing the Build**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 14, and sitting on $38. My current strategy is still laser-focused on that Flush hand, which is already at Level 8, offering 140 chips and 18 multiplier. The Joker lineup is pretty solid: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker (stacking that multi!), To the Moon (that sweet Holo multi bonus), the Gift Card (getting that extra Joker slot!), The Tribe for Flush synergy, and Acrobat for the final hand boost.\n\nLooking at the Shop, Fortune Teller is a hard pass; current Jokers are significantly better. Pluto is useless for a Flush build. Hone is interesting long-term, but not critical *right now*. A reroll is always a gamble, and with the Arcana Pack so cheap... that's the play.\n\nThat Arcana Pack for $4 is a steal! I'm hoping for some suit-changing cards – The World, The Moon, or something similar to make flushing easier. The Hierophant or The Empress for any hand enhancements is fine. Or, even The Hermit or Temperance for a money boost wouldn't hurt. And hey, even though unlikely, I'll happily take a Jupiter planet card.\n\nWith the current setup, Odd Todd (+ Chips) is first, followed by Abstract Joker (+Mult), To the Moon (more Mult), the Gift Card, The Tribe (x2 Mult), and Acrobat (x3 Mult). I'm confident in the order, optimizing for maximum multiplier stacking. So, yeah, no need to change the order.\n\nLet's buy that Arcana Pack, and see what the tarot cards bring!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
