{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy: Maximize Flush Level**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, Round 10, Shop Phase. I've got $22, and my primary focus *has* to be leveling that Flush. It's the lynchpin, the foundation of this run with \"The Tribe\" and the Telescope Voucher guaranteeing those Jupiter cards in the Celestial Packs, making Flush go brrrr. My Joker setup is already pretty solid: \"Odd Todd\" for chips, \"Abstract Joker\" for mult, \"To the Moon\" for sweet interest, \"Gift Card\" giving me an extra Joker slot which is very important for flexibility, and \"Acrobat\" adding even more damage. \n\nI've got the \"Telescope\" Voucher which works perfectly with the Celestial Packs, guaranteeing a Jupiter card, which means those packs are priority. I have \"Death\", which is good, but I'll save it. I've got to prioritize upgrades here to take advantage of the scaling potential.\n\nLooking at the shop, those Celestial Packs at $4 each are a steal! I've got to buy and immediately use both to level up Flush. That's $8 total, leaving me with $14. That interest from \"To the Moon\" is crucial for mid-game economy, but I can't be held back by interest gains alone. The Flush upgrade is paramount for scaling.\n\nSo, the plan is simple:\n1.  Buy Celestial Pack 1.\n2.  Use the Planet Card in the pack, ideally Jupiter.\n3.  Buy Celestial Pack 2.\n4.  Use the Planet Card in the pack, ideally Jupiter.\n5.  Check what I have left to spend or hold over.\n\nTherefore, the actions are:\n`action`: \"buy_booster\"\n`positions`: [1]\n`action`: \"buy_booster\"\n`positions`: [1]\n\nThat should maximize my Flush level and set me up for serious scaling. No need to sell a Joker at this point, especially not \"Odd Todd\", \"Abstract\" or \"Acrobat\". They are too good. Let's see what these packs give me!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
