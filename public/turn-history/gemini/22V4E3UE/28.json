{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Maximizing Score in Ante 2, Round 3**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 2, Round 3. I've got $7, a Celestial Pack, and these Jokers: Zany Joker (3-of-a-kind), The Tribe (Flush), Odd Todd (odd cards), and Abstract Joker (plus Mult per Joker). My hand levels are Full House and Flush, both at Level 2.\n\nThe pack choices are Saturn (Straight), Mercury (Pair), and Earth (Full House).\n\nMy goal is to optimize my score, considering the current Jokers. Both Full House and Flush are supported: The Tribe for Flush, Zany for Full House and 3-of-a-kind, and Abstract supports them all.\n\nI can level up:\n*   Saturn levels up Straight, but I don't have good Joker synergies for that.\n*   Mercury levels up Pair, which is weak scoring potential.\n*   Earth levels up Full House.\n\nLet's do the math. The Earth card, when selected, will upgrade Full House to Level 3. A Level 3 Full House will be 90 chips and 8 mult. With Zany, it becomes 32 Mult. Full House is the best play here, because I have Zany.\n\nThe calculation:\n*   Full House (Level 3): 90 Chips + (Individual card chips) + Odd Todd (+31 per odd card)\n*   Mult: (8 base + 12 Abstract + 12 Zany) = 32 Mult.\n\nA Flush at Level 2, with The Tribe and Abstract would give 36 mult.\n\nEarth seems the best choice because:\n1.  Zany Joker.\n2.  High-level hand already.\n3.  The others (Straight and Pair) don't fit my current strategy.\n\n*Wait a second...I need to make sure.*\nLet me check the levels again. Full House is level 2... Earth will level it to *level 3*.\n\nYep, definitely choosing Earth.\n\n*Action*: I'm selecting Earth (position 3).\n\n*Action complete*\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
