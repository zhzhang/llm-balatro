{"reasoning":"**Shop Optimization - Joker Order & Maximize Flush Bonus**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2/8, round 3, and I'm in the SHOP phase with a single dollar. Obviously, I can't buy anything (Standard Pack is $6, Crystal Ball is $10, and reroll is $5).  The important thing is to maximize my current hand and set up for the best score possible in the next round, so let's check my jokers.\n\nI have five jokers: Zany (+12 mult on 3-of-a-kind), The Tribe (x2 mult on a Flush), Odd Todd (+31 chips on odd ranks), Abstract (+15 mult), and Turtle Bean (+5 hand size). Since I can't purchase, the immediate move is *rearranging* the Jokers to ensure the multipliers trigger at the optimum time and contribute the most.\n\nGiven this, I should be focused on the triggers.  I should put `The Tribe` (the *multiplicative* Joker) at the very end to maximize its effect.  `Zany` and `Abstract` both contribute additive Mult, so it's most effective to have them earlier in the sequence.  This means I must rearrange the order to have The Tribe at the *end*.\n\nMy current order is: Zany, The Tribe, Odd Todd, Abstract, Turtle Bean. Let's get the most out of The Tribe. It triggers on a Flush and is a *multiplicative* Joker.  The trigger order is key to making this as optimal as possible. I currently have a Full House lvl 3, but the Tribe is for a Flush. Since I haven't played a hand yet, the optimization is:\n1.  **Rearrange the Jokers**.\n\nCurrently, I can play a Flush. I have a lvl 2 flush: 6 base mult + 15 (Abstract) = 21, *then* multiply by 2 (The Tribe) = 42 mult.  If the tribe is not placed last, I get (6 * 2) + 15 = 27. The order of triggers matters.\n\nAfter checking the rules, I can confirm that Independent Jokers should trigger left to right.  So, based on this understanding and that The Tribe needs to be last, I must change the Joker order:\n\n*   Current: Zany, Tribe, Odd Todd, Abstract, Turtle.\n*   New: Zany, Odd Todd, Abstract, Turtle, Tribe.\n\nThe next action is to execute the Joker rearrangement. I have to call the `rearrange_jokers` command with the proper positions.\n\nSo the action is: `rearrange_jokers [1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`. This order ensures that `The Tribe` is at the end. After the rearrangement is complete, the best action after is the `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,5,2]"}
