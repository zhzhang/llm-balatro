{"reasoning":"**Right, let's break this down. Ante 3, Round 6, aiming for 4,000 chips. The Boss blind reduces my hand size by 1. Base hand size is 8 + 3 from Turtle Bean - 1 from the Boss = 10 cards. I have 4 hands and discards left. Current chips are zero.**\n\n**I've got a decent set of Jokers: Odd Todd, Abstract Joker, Turtle Bean, The Tribe, and Gift Card. I have one consumable, \"The Hanged Man,\" which destroys up to 2 cards. Also have a Telescope Voucher, but that's for later.**\n\n**Looking at my hand, I have a potential Flush in Spades: Ace, King, Queen, 10, 8, 3, and 2.  I can play any five. I should also note that Odd Todd gives chips for odd-ranked cards, and Abstract Joker gives a multiplier per Joker. The Tribe doubles the multiplier if I have a Flush. Gift card increases sell value at the end of the round.**\n\n**My first instinct is to find the best hand. I can get some major points from the flush - Base is 65 chips, 8 mult, but this could be multiplied by two from the Tribe. Odd Todd will provide bonuses as well. I'm going to run the calculations for two Flush options, the first is High card Spades (A, K, Q, 10, 8), and the second is mostly Odd cards (A, 3, 8, 10, Q). After running the numbers, the second choice will yield the most chips.**\n\n**I should use \"The Hanged Man\" now to thin the deck. I'm thinking of destroying the King of Hearts and 8 of Hearts. They are not Spades and their even ranks are bad for Odd Todd. Removing those cards increases the chance of drawing more Spades in subsequent hands. I should go ahead and do this because this flush will take me over the goal of 4000 chips.  Using \"The Hanged Man\" now also means I can use the Gift Card on a later consumable, if I ever get another one.**\n\n**So, the action is to use the consumable (Hanged Man) and target those two cards. I'm also going to check, should I re-arrange Jokers? I want my chips, multi and times mult order.**\n\n**I'm looking back over my actions. There is no reason to discard at this point. I have 7 spades in my hand and can make a flush out of that hand. A, 3 are odd. K, Q, 10, 8, 2 are even. I will play (A, 3, K, Q, 10). I should get the two Odd Todd triggers.**\n\n**The JSON should be pretty simple: \"action\":\"use\\_consumable\", and the positions array which should be \\[1, 8, 9] (consumable index and the two cards).**\n\n**The JSON should be a single line, valid JSON without extra text.**\n\n**I've double-checked all the indices, and it looks good. Let's send it.**\n```json\n{\"action\":\"use_consumable\",\"positions\":[1,8,9]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,8,9]"}
