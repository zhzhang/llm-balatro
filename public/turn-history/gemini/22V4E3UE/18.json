{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Choosing the Right Booster!**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's round two, ante two, and I'm in the planet pack step. My current joker setup is pretty solid: Zany Joker for that sweet Three of a Kind boost, The Tribe doubling Flush mult, and Odd Todd adding chips for odd-ranked cards. I've got $7 in the bank. I'm riding high on a successful Full House last round.\n\nLooking at the Celestial pack options, I've got Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury. Jupiter levels up my Flush, Mars Four of a Kind, and Mercury Pairs. Hmm, given that I already have \"The Tribe,\" which gives me that crucial X2 Mult *specifically for Flushes*, Jupiter is screaming my name.\n\nMy \"The Tribe\" synergizes perfectly with a leveled-up Flush. A Level 1 Flush is 35 chips / 4 mult. With Jupiter, it becomes 50 chips / 6 mult. Combined with \"The Tribe,\" a level 2 Flush potentially scores (50 + card chips) * (6 * 2), or (50 + cards) * 12. And that's before factoring in Odd Todd! If I play a Flush with odd cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3), that chip count explodes. Zany Joker's nice for Three of a Kind, but that's not what I'm focused on right now.\n\nYup, Jupiter is the clear winner here. My focus is supporting \"The Tribe.\"\n\nI'll select position 1, which is Jupiter.\n\nI've got the command, the JSON format in mind... let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
