{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Shop: A High-Card Pursuit**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 8, big blind looming, and I'm sitting on $34. The goal is clear: maximize the scoring potential for the final push. The strategy is solid: high card with face card retriggers and multipliers. My Joker setup is almost perfect, built around Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia, and Sock and Buskin, creating a chain reaction of multipliers and retriggers on the first face card played.\n\nCurrently, nothing in the shop screams \"must-have\" to significantly improve my Joker setup. My initial thoughts are on the Boss, Crimson Heart – that one’s a real threat to my strategy. I have a Director's Cut voucher for a boss reroll, but I need to see if the command is available. My main priority is rerolling the boss, should Crimson Heart still be in play. My main concern is to get a way out of it before the blinds increase.\n\nHowever, the game presents a few choices here:\n\n*   Buy Tarot Merchant to improve future shops.\n*   Reroll shop for a chance at a Celestial Pack with my Telescope voucher (guaranteed Pluto for a High Card level up) or better consumables.\n*   Move to the Round Select (the most standard move).\n\nGiven that my High Card hand is already at Level 7, and my scoring is already high enough to easily beat the Big Blind, I should make sure I don't lose that advantage. The \"Can Reroll Boss\" flag is a positive sign and I have the voucher, I'll go with a reroll to improve the hand.\n\nThe most efficient move to spend excess gold (above interest) is to find a Celestial Pack for a guaranteed Level up.\nI'm going to take a shot at rerolling. It's the most proactive move to spend excess gold (above interest) to find a Celestial Pack.\nI'll go with `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
