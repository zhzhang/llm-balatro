{"reasoning":"**Strategic Play: The Psychic**\n\nOkay, current Ante is 4, Round 8. I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase, just sold \"The World\" which was necessary. The Blind is The Psychic, and I *must* play 5 cards. My target is 10,000 chips, and I have a paltry $49 in the bank. I have a solid inventory: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia, and the Justice consumable.\n\nMy Joker strategy is crucial here, and I've meticulously worked out the optimal order. Pareidolia makes everything face cards, Hanging Chad retriggers the first card played, and Photograph doubles its mult. Smiley Face adds +5 mult to each face card. The final joker, Stuntman, gives a flat bonus of +10 to mult and 250 chips. Based on the *on-scored* phase order, Smiley Face and Photograph will trigger first, with their effects doubling and adding to each subsequent trigger thanks to Hanging Chad.\n\nHere's my scoring logic: The first card scores, then Smiley Face applies, then Photograph doubles the total, then Hanging Chad triggers everything twice. I *know* the current order is ideal: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. I’ve checked the scoring order.\n\nLet's calculate the potential: A High Card (base 1 Mult) should get: 1 (base), +5 (Smiley), X2 (Photograph), then Hanging Chad hits twice more, with Smiley Face and Photograph. Then Stuntman kicks in with +10 mult and 250 chips. This leads to an estimated 88x mult and 266 chips per card: 266 * 88 is 23,408 chips! That far exceeds the 10,000 chip requirement.\n\nThe task is set: Play 5 cards. The goal is clear: Advance to the round. The action is `play_round`.\n\nMy previous action, selling the world, set me up to make space for a Blue Seal reward. I have a hand size of 6, thanks to Stuntman. My goal is to hold one card with a Blue Seal at the end of the round. So, let’s see the card. If it *is* a Blue Seal (like a 10 of Diamonds, perhaps), the Blue Seal will generate a Planet card.\n\nEverything is primed and ready. I am ready to play!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
