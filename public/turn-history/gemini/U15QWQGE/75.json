{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment: Reroll Decision**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 4, Round 6. $48 in the bank. Current reroll cost is $5. Let's see... the core engine is *Photograph* combined with *Hanging Chad* and *Stuntman*, aiming for massive face card multipliers. *Gift Card* is adding a nice flat mult and scaling the value of my Jokers and consumables, and *Trading Card* is there for economy and deck thinning.\n\nThe shop offerings are underwhelming: *Oops! All 6s*, *Zany Joker*, and *Even Steven*. No real upgrades here. I'm running a Spades build, and the build is benefitting the most from Flushes or High Card/Pair/Three of a Kind involving a Face Card. The level 4 flush is suggesting I lean into Spades with \"The World\" as well.\n\n*Zany Joker* seems tempting, but the *Gift Card*'s long-term scaling value makes it a no-go for replacement. I can't currently use either *Justice* or *The World* as they are consumable cards.\n\nGiven my hand size reduction from *Stuntman*, I really want to avoid any cards that aren't core to the build. With $48, I should comfortably reroll. Interest is capped at $25, so I can comfortably eat the $5 cost.\n\nThe priority is clear: Reroll. No immediate use for the consumables yet – they need targets, and I'm in the shop. The Joker order doesn't affect the *Photograph* and *Hanging Chad* combo. *Gift Card* is \"Holo\", so it's activation is independent.\n\nNow, wait... let's reread *Gift Card*... it adds $1 sell value to Jokers and Consumables per round. That's $7 per round with my current setup. Worth noting. The holographic effect adds +10 Mult, so the card is essential. I want to keep this card.\n\nThe only options at this point are to reroll. I have enough money to comfortably reroll, and I can be above the interest cap. Let's do it and hope for something better. The goal is a better scaling Joker or a Planet/Spectral pack.\n\n*Self-correction:* No point in buying any of the shop cards just to sell them later, I have limited space.\n\nSo, yeah, reroll. Let's see what the shop throws at us.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
