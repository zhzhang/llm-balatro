{"reasoning":"**Balatro Booster Pack Analysis**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 7, Standard Pack. Let's see what we've got. Currently sitting on $41. Inventory is: Gift Card (Holo, +10 Mult, Scaling Sell Value), Photograph (X2 first face card), Hanging Chad (Retrigger first card 2x), Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size), and Pareidolia (All cards face cards). Two consumables, Justice and The World. The target is 7,500.\n\nPack choices: 8 of Clubs (+8 chips), Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips), and a Jack of Clubs (Foil: +50 chips).\n\nHmm... Stuntman gives a flat chip bonus of +250. Pareidolia means every card is a face card. Photograph, Hanging Chad, and a potential Red Seal from a previous pick on a 9 of Spades (if I select it) provides insane X-mult on the first card. The Jack of Clubs (Foil) gives +60 chips, and is naturally a face card. The Queen of Diamonds adds 10, the 8 of Clubs adds 8. Since I have Stuntman, flat chips are slightly less good, but +60 is still better than +10 or +8. None have seals.\n\nMy current engine looks like this:\nFirst card played (let's use the 9 of Spades with Red Seal).\n1. Base scoring.\n2. Red Seal retrigger.\n3. Hanging Chad retrigger 1.\n4. Hanging Chad retrigger 2.\n\nPareidolia makes it a face card.\nPhotograph (X2) triggers on the *first* scoring event of the first face card.\nWait, let's verify Balatro rules for Photograph + Hanging Chad.\nPhotograph says \"First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored.\" In Balatro, \"when scored\" happens every time a card is triggered.\nSo, if the first card is a face card (Pareidolia):\n- Trigger 1 (Initial): Photograph X2.\n- Trigger 2 (Red Seal): Photograph X2.\n- Trigger 3 (Chad): Photograph X2.\n- Trigger 4 (Chad): Photograph X2.\nTotal: X16 mult on the first card! That's massive.\n\nNow back to the pack:\nJack of Clubs (Foil) is best because it's a face card and provides +50 chips. More chips is always good with X-mult.\n\nThe selection:\n8 of Clubs.\nQueen of Diamonds.\nJack of Clubs (Foil)\n\nThe best of the 3 is *Jack of Clubs (Foil)*. Clearly, I should select the Jack of Clubs (Foil).\n\nI should check if I should sell or use anything first. No space in Jokers or Consumables. But this is a card pack, not a shop buy.\n\nWait, I have \"Gift Card\". It adds $1 sell value at the end of the round.\nI should check my Joker order.\nGift Card (Holo) gives +10 mult.\nIn Balatro, Holo/Polychrome/Foil on a Joker triggers *after* the Joker's own ability.\nGift Card's Holo Edition gives +10 mult. Photograph provides X2 mult triggers.\nThe order of Jokers matters for \"Independent Jokers\" (Step 5 of scoring). Photograph triggers at Step 3 (on scored). Gift Card (+10 mult holo) triggers at Step 5.\nGift Card's +10 mult will be added *after* the X2s from Photograph happen.\nLet's re-read the rules:\n3) Played cards score... 'On scored' Jokers (Photograph triggers here).\n5) 'Independent' Jokers activate left-to-right (editions on Jokers trigger here).\nIf Photograph triggers at step 3, it applies X2 to the *current* mult.\nCurrent mult at step 3: Base Mult + Card enhancements.\nWith a Level 1 Pair (Base Mult 2).\nCard 1 (9 of Spades) triggers.\n- Photograph triggers: 2 * 2 = 4.\n- Red Seal triggers: 4 * 2 = 8.\n- Chad 1 triggers: 8 * 2 = 16.\n- Chad 2 triggers: 16 * 2 = 32.\nStep 5 (Independent Jokers):\n- Gift Card Holo: 32 + 10 = 42.\nTotal Mult = 42.\n\nWait, if Photograph triggers during card scoring, +Mult from Gift Card (Holo\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
