{"reasoning":"**My Strategy: Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 12, Ante 6/8, and I'm staring down this PLANET_PACK. I've got $38, and my current build is all about High Card.  The Jokers are in place: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia, plus The World and The Hierophant consumables, and Overstock, Overstock Plus, and Director's Cut vouchers.\n\nMy High Card strategy is working well. Last turn, I saw how a Level 2 High Card, combined with the Jokers, can score over 80k. Now, I'm faced with choosing between Pluto (High Card lvl 2), Uranus (Two Pair lvl 1), and Venus (Three of a Kind lvl 1). It's an easy call; Pluto is the obvious choice to level up my High Card. Since the current strategy is exclusively High Card, picking Pluto is the most logical choice. This will increase High Card from Level 2 to Level 3, and I'm expecting significantly higher scores.\n\nMy initial thought was to estimate the chips at 90,000, but I needed to do some detailed math. So, let's break it down: a Level 3 High Card will have a base of 25 chips and 3 mult. Adding a Rank 10 Red Seal, plus Stuntman (250 chips, 10 mult) and the triggers from Chad/Red Seal (estimated four triggers). With that, the calculation: Base 25 + 10x4 + 250 = 315 chips and, for the mult: starting at 3 base, (3+5)x2...x2 with triggers = 312 multiplier. The final score: 315 * 312 = 98,280. So around 90-100k is a solid estimate.\n\nI remember I'm in the pack step, and the command is `select <pack_card_position>`. So, selecting Pluto is simply `select 1`.  No targets needed for Planet cards. The prompt requires a JSON output. I need to make sure this is correctly formatted.\n\nAction: \"select\"\nPositions: [1] (Pluto)\nIntended hand: \"high card\"\nAnd, my estimated score is 98,280.\n\nSo the final JSON should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"high card\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 98280\n}\n```\n\nPluto is the core of the build, no reason not to take it. The JSON is good. Let's level up this High Card!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
