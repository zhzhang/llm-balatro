{"reasoning":"**The Strategic Play: High Card Dominance**\n\nOkay, so the ante is at 6/8, and this is round 13, the big blind. I need 30,000 chips, and I have $28. This should be easy. I've got a fantastic setup here built around High Card with some solid synergies that should blast through the big blind easily.\n\nMy Jokers are key: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. Pareidolia is the foundation, turning every card into a face card, which is perfect with Hanging Chad and Photograph. Chad retriggers the first card twice – that’s three hits total. Photograph doubles the multiplier for that first face card *each* time it’s played, which is *three* times! Smiley Face gives +5 Mult for each face card, and Stuntman is a nice base boost of +250 chips and +10 Mult, and I will be able to play a holo version!\n\nWith my strategy, a single High Card should deliver: The High Card itself gives 25 chips, and 3 mult. Add Stuntman’s 250 chips, and then the card's value. Then add all of the multiplier bonuses. Okay, let's break it down: The High Card base is 25 chips, and 3 mult. The card itself gets +9 chips. Chad re-triggers twice, adding +9 chips each time. So we have 25 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 52 chips. Stuntman boosts that to 302 chips. The Stuntman gives +10 mult, Chad and Smiley get us to +28 multiplier, multiplied by Photgraph's double effect 3 times (2x2x2 = 8). So, ~302 * 28 * 8 = 67,648 chips! That should easily crush the 30k blind. I last scored 68,705.\n\nSo, do I use that Foil Tag to skip the round? Hmm... the Foil Tag gives a free, foil Joker in the next shop. Foil is a +50 chip bonus. Stuntman is +250. Also, my slots are full and I have good synergy. Skipping is a waste. I'm going to play, win the round, and grab the reward money (4 dollars), the per-hand money (up to $5 since I have $28 in total), and the interest. All of those bonuses will set me up even better for the next round. I think I will play this round.\n\nAction: `play_round`\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
