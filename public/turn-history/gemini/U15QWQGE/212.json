{"reasoning":"**My Plan for Ante 8: Boosting High Card to Conquer the Crimson Heart**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Big Blind just completed, I'm at the shop in Ante 8, and I'm sitting on $41. The goal? Beat the Crimson Heart boss, which means disabling one of my crucial Jokers each hand. That's a huge problem. I'm currently running a High Card build, level 8, with a pretty sweet setup: Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia, and Sock and Buskin.\n\nThe core of the build is Pareidolia, which turns *every* card I play into a face card. Then I trigger Photograph for the multiplier, Hanging Chad to retrigger it twice, and Sock and Buskin to retrigger *all* face cards. Stuntman is providing a decent chip and multiplier boost. Given my setup, just playing one face card should result in a massive score.\n\nThe problem? Crimson Heart. If it hits Photograph, that's almost game over. If it hits Pareidolia, the combo *dies*. If it hits Stuntman, that's a big chip and mult loss. If it hits Chad or Buskin, I still lose retriggers.\n\nI've already used The World and a Pluto card to reach level 8. There's a Jumbo Celestial Pack in the shop. With the Telescope voucher I have, this is *guaranteed* to contain a Pluto card. Leveling High Card further is the most consistent way to scale.\n\nHere's my calculated approach:\n\n*   First, I *must* buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6. I have the money, and it is a guaranteed Pluto due to the Telescope. I'll open it immediately and use the Pluto to level up High Card.\n*   Once I've leveled the hand, I should consider rerolling the boss, which costs $10. Avoiding the Crimson Heart is key. I have to think about this *after* buying the pack.\n*   The Tarot Merchant isn't worth it at this stage. I'm at the end of Ante 8 and I'm happy with my deck.\n*   Shoot the Moon is a backup option, but I'd need to sell a Joker and I don't have enough Queens.\n*   The Ancient Joker is too inconsistent for this build.\n\nSo, the play is to `buy_booster 1` (Jumbo Celestial Pack). Buying the pack immediately scales my core strategy.\n\nThe reasoning is pretty simple: leveling High Card through Pluto provides the most reliable power increase for this setup, even if I lose a Joker to the Crimson Heart. This is my best bet to beat the boss. Now, let's see what happens at the boss blind...\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
