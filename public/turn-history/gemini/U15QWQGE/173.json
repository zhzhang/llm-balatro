{"reasoning":"**The Optimization Mindset: Reroll for Celestial Packs**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm in Round 16, pre-boss, and the goal is to crush this blind. I've got a solid High Card build going, focusing on face card synergies – Pareidolia, Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman. My High Card is at level 4, and I've got a decent cushion with that last 72k score. But this upcoming boss, \"The Eye,\" throws a wrench in the works: no hand type repeats. \n\nI've got $73 in the bank, and my core strategy revolves around High Card, which isn't the most adaptable. I need to make sure I have enough High Card level to take down the boss and the upcoming rounds. I also have the Director's Cut voucher, which lets me reroll the boss, as well as the Telescope voucher, meaning every Celestial Pack contains Pluto and will increase my High Card level.\n\nCurrently, my shop (Cartomancer, Egg, Supernova) is completely useless for my build. Cartomancer costs a joker, Supernova is less than Smiley Face, and Egg is for money scaling, which I don't need right now.\n\nMy immediate priority is to find Celestial Packs or Arcana Packs; the former guarantees Pluto for a High Card level, and the latter could potentially offer Strength/Death cards to further refine my deck, though my build is already focused on face cards.\n\n\"The Eye\" is a pain. I can't just spam High Card. I'll need to either have a strong enough High Card to beat the boss solo, or shift gears and start playing other hands to beat the blind. Luckily, I have Director's Cut to get out of this mess. But that's $10 down the drain.\n\nSo, I have a few options: Reroll the shop for Celestial Packs, buy Supernova (no), or use the Round Select (I'm not doing that).\n\nReroll shop is the optimal move.\n\nI need to focus on Celestial Packs (Pluto) to power up that High Card level. My $73 buys me a reroll for $7, leaving me with $66, a small price for the opportunity.\n\nMy Jokers are perfectly ordered for optimal scoring (Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia). Smiley Face boosts mult per face card, Photograph doubles the mult of the first face card, Hanging Chad retriggers the first card, and Stuntman adds both chips and mult (Holo edition).\n\nI've been thinking about the \"Order of Effects\" and how the Jokers' triggers interact. I know that Smiley Face triggers before Photograph, and Hanging Chad retriggers the first card twice, which includes Smiley Face and Photograph's effects again. And I'm reconfirming that the Holo edition of Stuntman only triggers after all of the card-specific bonuses.\n\nI just need to level that High Card, and a shop reroll is the only move. I can go back to using \"Director's Cut\" if \"The Eye\" is too hard.\n\nThe current shop? Still garbage. Cartomancer (6), Egg (4), Supernova (5) – nothing for me. Nope. Only reroll makes sense. No need to buy and sell for Campfire.\n\nOkay, let's roll those dice: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
