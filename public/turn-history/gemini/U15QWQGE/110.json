{"reasoning":"**My Assessment of the Current Situation**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 5, Round 9. I've got $26. My current Joker setup is solid: a Smiley Face for face card mult, Photograph for that sweet X2 multiplier on the first face card, Hanging Chad to retrigger, Stuntman for a flat chip bonus and small mult, and Pareidolia making everything a face card. I also have Justice, but I'm saving that for later.\n\nThe shop is...underwhelming. The Star doesn't fit my High Card strategy, Rough Gem requires Diamonds which I don't have a build for, Uranus is for Two Pair which isn't my focus, and Sly Joker is redundant given Stuntman. Rerolling costs $8, which would drop me to $18 – not ideal. I'd be losing $2 of interest.\n\nMy core combo is solid with Pareidolia, Chad, Smiley, and Photograph. Stuntman is the icing. With it, my High Card should score around 22,880, easily clearing the Small and Big Blinds.\n\nGiven the shop's weakness and my current power, I think the smartest move is to conserve my money. Rerolling is too expensive, and I'd be better off saving up for the next shop. I should be able to clear the next few blinds with no issues.\n\nNow, wait a second...I've got to consider my historical play style. I've been aggressive with rerolls, especially for Pluto. However, this is more of a long-term play, and $8 is a bad investment here. I'll get $5 interest at my current balance and $3 if I reroll. It's an easy math equation. I'll stick with a plan that prioritizes saving the money.\n\nSo, I'll go to the round select. Before that, let's just double check the Justice and Joker order.\n\nNo reason to use Justice right now. The Joker order is... Smiley, Photograph, Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. Just checked the math and re-triggered order: 1) Boss effects. 2) On played (DNA etc). 3) Scored cards: Base chips, modifiers, 'On scored' jokers, then retriggers. Hanging Chad retriggers after base, so the order is correct. The order of Smiley and Photograph is important because Photograph doubles the current mult including Smiley's add.\n\nThe shop is still worthless. Time for the `round_select` screen.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
