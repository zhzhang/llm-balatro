{"reasoning":"**Final Preparations for a High-Card Blitz**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 8, with a 50,000-chip goal, and a *lot* of potential. No chips currently, but we have a good hand and a bunch of Joker powerhouses. My current hand is: Ace of Spades, 9 of Spades (Foil, Retrigger 1), Jack of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 7 of Diamonds. I've got Pareidolia making everything a face card, and Photograph is ready to double our multiplier. Hanging Chad's going to retrigger, Sock and Buskin will get all my face cards involved, and Stuntman Holo is a straight +10 to the multiplier and +250 chips. We also have consumables to play with. Money is at $31, which is fine for now.\n\nThe plan is simple: use \"The Chariot\" to turn one card into a Steel card, and then play my Foil, Red-Sealed 9 of Spades as a High Card. It looks like it can go much higher than 50,000.  The 9 of Spades already gets a +50 chips boost from Foil and a retrigger from its Red Seal. With Pareidolia, the 9 of Spades counts as a face card.\n\nSo, let's look at the calculations. The base High Card is level 7. With Stuntman, that's 315 chips. With the 9 of Spades, there's the initial trigger of +59 chips. Then, with Photograph, Hanging Chad, the Red Seal and Sock & Buskin (making a total of five triggers), that chip total will get *much* higher. The level 7 base multiplier is 7, with Stuntman, that is 17 mult.  Photograph is \"On scored\", so the Multiplier will be (7 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 224, plus Holo's +10, which means 234 multiplier. Total chips 610, and 142,740 total score. Using \"The Chariot\" before playing, the total score should be 142,740 * 1.5 = 214,110.\n\nBut, I need to be exact. It is important to remember what happens \"when scored.\" \"On scored\" Jokers trigger. So the order matters.\n\nBase Chips: 65 (level 7 High Card) + 250 (Stuntman) = 315.\nBase Mult: 7.\n*   The 9 of Spades: +59 chips + Photograph (Multi becomes 14)\n*   Hanging Chad Retrigger: 59 chips + Photograph (Mult becomes 28)\n*   Hanging Chad Retrigger: 59 chips + Photograph (Mult becomes 56)\n*   Red Seal: 59 chips + Photograph (Mult becomes 112)\n*   Sock and Buskin: 59 chips + Photograph (Mult becomes 224)\n*   Stuntman: +10 Mult, now Mult = 234\n\nTotal Score: (315 + 295) * 234 = 610 * 234 = 142,740.\n\nThe Steel card multiplier happens after all of that (Step 4, held-in-hand ability):  224 * 1.5 = 336. Then Stuntman Holo is added:  336 + 10 = 346.\nTotal Score: 610 * 346 = 211,060.  Well over the target. And all this is before the $31 that I have.\n\nNow, which is best: play first or consumable first? With this setup, it doesn't matter, though I should definitely use The Chariot for its boost. Using \"The Chariot\" now ensures I have the card for the whole round, which is great because I want the Steel card!\n\nTherefore, the only choice left is the \"use_consumable\" action. The target card for consumption should be card 6 (7 of Diamonds), as it's the weakest card. But, let's keep the Ace in hand.\n\nOkay, let's go with this: the Chariot to Card 6. That's the action. And this will be easy!\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\":\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,6]"}
