{"reasoning":"**Flush-Focused Strategy Refinement**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop, Ante 4, Round 6. I've got $45 – not a ton, but enough to make some key moves. Joker slots are at 4/5, and I've got a decent set: Gift Card for sell value, Photograph for face card multiplication, Hanging Chad for re-triggers, and Stuntman for a chip boost (though the -2 hand size is a slight drawback). Consumables are Justice (glass card enhancement) and The World (spades conversion) – useful, but not critical right now.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Zany Joker could be good for three of a kinds, the Ceremonial Dagger has interesting scaling potential, Lusty Joker gives a mult boost to heart cards, but the real prize I see is *Pareidolia*. It's going to turn *all* my cards into face cards.\n\nI've already sold Trading Card to make space for Pareidolia, which costs $5. I need to get it. That's the key. This is perfect for my overall plan, which is focusing on flushes, specifically spades.\n\nI'm thinking ahead: with Pareidolia, I'm going to have every card count as a face card. Photograph doubles the multiplier on the first face card played, and Hanging Chad re-triggers that first card *twice*. That means I get a multiplier of 8x on my first card played: Base x 2 x 2 x 2. This is huge; it solves the problem of needing to draw specific face cards for a high multiplier. I can have a consistent mult on any hand. No more reliance on random face card draws, meaning flushes and high card plays become much more reliable.\n\nLet's do this. I'm buying Pareidolia.\n\nOkay, money before the purchase: $45. Pareidolia costs $5. After this buy I have $40. Next reroll will cost $7. Action: `buy_card 3`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [3]"}
