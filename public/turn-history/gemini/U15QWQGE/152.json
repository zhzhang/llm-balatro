{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment: Ante 6, Round 14 - Consolidating Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop phase after a Tarot pack, holding $29. This is good; keeping above $25 nets me the maximum interest. I've got a solid High Card strategy going, and my Jokers are beautifully synergized: Pareidolia making all cards face cards, Smiley Face giving me a flat +5 Mult for those faces, Photograph doubling the Mult of the first face card played, and Hanging Chad retriggers that first card twice. Stuntman Holo is adding a nice chunk of chips and +10 Mult at the end of each hand. I've also got The World and The Hierophant Tarot cards in inventory, but I need to play them in the round.\n\nRerolling the shop seems unnecessary given the strength of my current build, especially since it's just a random reroll. The cards on offer don't look like improvements. I'm focusing on the High Card, consistently scoring between 30k and 80k. I've already confirmed the Joker order: Smiley, then Photograph, then Hanging Chad, and lastly Stuntman, which ensures that Photograph's multiplier is at its most effective, and Stuntman's Holo bonus applies at the end. The order of Smiley and Photograph is critical for the maximum multiplier. The Hanging Chad's position is not so important because it happens *during* the score phase, which I've confirmed by re-reading the documentation.\n\nI could *try* to use my consumables now, but it's risky because I don't see my current hand during the SHOP step. It's usually more efficient to wait until the round itself to use them.\n\nI've got the Lucky enhancements, and I should easily get past the Boss blind. I can't use Zany, Misprint, or Crafty to improve my current build, so I'll stay put.\n\nMy decision? I'm going to hit `round_select` to move to the next round. I'm confident in my strategy and Joker setup. I can re-evaluate after the blind, but now, `round_select` is the clear choice.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
