{"reasoning":"**Current Pack Evaluation: Jack of Diamonds Takes the Win**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Round 5, Standard Pack (Jumbo) for $49. I've got a decent Joker setup: Gift Card for mult, Mail-In Rebate for chip generation, Trading Card for discard destruction, a Photograph, and Hanging Chad. My goal is to maximize score, especially given \"The Goad\" debuff (Spades). The Photograph + Hanging Chad core engine requires face cards. The Jack of Diamonds in this pack (choice 4) is the obvious choice. It's a face card, diamonds avoid the current debuff, and directly supports the Photograph + Hanging Chad synergy. The Ace of Diamonds (Red Seal) is tempting, but not the best here. Although it can be retriggered with Hanging Chad and itself, it will not synergize with Photograph and the resulting multiplier. I could get much higher scores with a Jack of Diamonds in the current build. The low-value cards and the glass card aren't even worth considering here.\n\nI'm sticking with the plan: Select Position 4.\n\nI don't need to rearrange jokers – the Gift Card's flat mult is fine where it is. I'll hold onto the Justice consumable for a high-value card play later.\n\nThe schema is confirmed: I'm selecting the Jack of Diamonds.\n\nRe-verifying the Red Seal Ace, even with Hanging Chad and the Red Seal retrigger, I can get more power with the Jack. I'm taking the Jack of Diamonds (position 4).\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
