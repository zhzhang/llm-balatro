{"reasoning":"**My Initial Shop Strategy: Building a Solid Foundation**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 2, Round 1, and I've got $10. My Jokers are Gift Card (Holo), which is fantastic for +10 Mult, and Mail-In Rebate (Foil), giving me a solid +50 Chips. I can see the potential of these two together: (Chips + 50) * (Mult + 10). I have 3 open Joker slots, so I should see if I can find some complementary effects.\n\nLooking at the shop, the *Buffoon Pack* and the *Celestial Pack* are both $4. *Reroll Surplus* is too expensive, leaving me with nothing to play with. Right now, *reroll* seems unnecessary, but may be useful later. I have interest to consider: $1 interest for every $5 held. Spending reduces this, so I need to balance spending with the interest gains. I have to think about my long-term goals of what kind of build I can make to get as high a score as possible.\n\nGenerally, I know Jokers are more valuable early on than individual card upgrades. Buying both packs would leave me with $2. Buying one would leave me with $6, securing at least one interest point. Based on this, I have to think about what pack is best for me.\n\nThe Gift Card gives me +10 Mult, and the Mail-In Rebate provides +50 Chips. These are additive, so the order doesn't matter (though I'll keep the order of Chips then Mult). I know that the 'independent' Jokers activate left-to-right, based on editions on the Joker. I have to remember that because they have editions. Right now, I have Gift Card (Holo) in slot 1 and Mail-In Rebate (Foil) in slot 2. The *Buffoon Pack* seems like a high-value purchase because it helps me fill my Joker slots. This pack will lead to more immediate power. I'm going to spend the money I can.\n\nThe main decision here is to purchase a pack, but which one? Should I buy the Buffoon Pack? It costs $4. This leaves me with $6, securing an interest point. If I get the *Buffoon Pack*, I'll see 2 new Jokers, and choose one. It's a risk, but potentially a powerful one.\n\nSo the plan is: I'm buying the *Buffoon Pack* because I have open Joker slots, and I need to find more Jokers to complement the Chips and Mult I already have.\nI'm going to check the money. If I buy the Buffoon Pack, I'll have $6. This will give me $1 interest, so $7 to start. If I buy both, I'm at $2.\n\nI think I'll start with the *Buffoon Pack*.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
