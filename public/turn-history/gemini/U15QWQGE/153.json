{"reasoning":"**Analysis for Blind Select: The Manacle**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 6, Round 14, and the game step is BLIND_SELECT. The current blind is \"The Manacle,\" which reduces my hand size by one card. I'm currently at $29, and I need to score 40,000 chips. I'm rocking a solid High Card level 4 (35 chips base, 4 mult). Recent scores have been pretty reliable, consistently landing between 31k and 85k, so I'm not overly concerned about this.\n\nFirst, let's address the blind. The Manacle reducing my hand size by 1 isn't a huge deal with my current hand size reductions. With Stuntman, my base hand size of 8 becomes 6 (8-2). Then, with the blind, I’m at 5 (6-1). This is still more than enough for a High Card strategy.\n\nMy Joker setup is crucial here: I have Smiley Face (+5 mult for face cards), Photograph (x2 mult for the first face card), Hanging Chad (retriggers the first played card twice), Stuntman (Holo, +250 Chips, +10 Mult), and Pareidolia (all cards are face cards).\n\nNow for the math: If I can get a face card (and Pareidolia guarantees this), my base score is looking something like 35 (High Card) + ~10 (card rank) + 250 (Stuntman) = 295 chips. The base mult is 4. Smiley Face gives +5, Photograph doubles, and Chad retriggers the whole cycle twice. The order is crucial here, and the current order: Smiley, Photograph, Chad, Stuntman, is correct. That initial card score gives me base mult of 4 + 5 (Smiley) = 9 mult x2 (Photograph) = 18. Then, Chad does the same thing again: 18 + 5 (Smiley) = 23 mult x2 (Photograph) = 46. One more time: 46 + 5 (Smiley) = 51, mult x2 (Photograph) = 102. The holo edition on Stuntman gives +10 to the total: 102 + 10= 112. So, the total score would be 295 * 112 = 33,040 chips.\n\nI need 40,000, but I have a high ceiling for extra cards and extra chips. The key is to maximize the multipliers from my Jokers, and the current order looks to be optimal. Re-rolling the blind isn't worth it, and I can't even use my consumables on this step, so no, to both.\n\nI'm confident I can make the target in one or two hands, so, I'll go ahead and play the round.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
