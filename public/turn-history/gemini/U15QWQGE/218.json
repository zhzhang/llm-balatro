{"reasoning":"**Current Situation Analysis: Round 20 - Crimson Heart**\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. I'm in Round 20, the Crimson Heart blind is up. The annoying part? Every hand, one Joker gets disabled. I need to hit 100,000 chips. Right now, I'm sitting on 26,215, so I've got 73,785 more to go, and only two hands to do it. Thankfully, I have 4 discards available to help me get there.\n\nLet's break down my inventory. I've got Photograph, which is a double-multiplier for the first face card I play each hand. Hanging Chad triggers the first card I play twice. Stuntman is my chip and multi-booster. Pareidolia is my face card enabler - which is key here. Sock and Buskin is sadly disabled this hand. I have a consumable, \"The World,\" which changes 3 cards to Spades, but it is not useful here.\n\nMy current hand? High Card, level 9. Let's see... a 3 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, and a single 8 of Clubs. Obviously, this is not optimal.\n\nThe strategy is clear: Maximize chips using Pareidolia, Photograph, and Hanging Chad. My focus is on big plays to reach that 100k target. I've got to find Aces and Bonus Jacks.\n\nOkay, let's play the math. If I play the 8 of Clubs, I'm starting with a base of 85 chips, 9 mult. Pareidolia means it's considered a face card, so Photograph kicks in, doubling the mult. Hanging Chad triggers the 8 of Clubs two more times, also with Photograph applying.\n\nThe math, simplified: base chips from High Card level + 8 chips from 8 of Clubs + Stuntman's additional chips multiplied by total mult from my active Jokers.\n\nI have 26k chips, so, based on this round and last, I might hit 30k. I need to score approximately 40k more per turn to win the round.\n\nGiven I have a limited amount of discards left, I need to make the right call: I'm ditching the low cards (3s, 7, and 5s) to dig for something better – an Ace, or even better, my Bonus Jack. I have a gut feeling that this will put me in a better place.\n\nBased on previous hands, I know my strategy works. I'm hoping I can pull this off, because if I don't, I don't see how I'm going to win the round.\n\nOk, let's discard.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
