{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision Making**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 5, Round 11, and I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` phase, grabbing the Mega Celestial Pack. The goal is to pick the second planet card; Pluto was already selected, and now I have a choice. My hand is a High Card build; the main strategy is built around leveling up High Card. My inventory is as follows: Jokers: Smiley Face, Photograph (Holo), Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), Pareidolia. Consumable: Justice. High Card is Level 2. The pack options are Jupiter (Flush), Mercury (Pair), Neptune (Straight Flush), and Saturn (Straight).\n\nGiven my build, I'm not prioritizing Flush, Pair, Straight Flush, or Straight. So, my focus is solely on completing this pack. Since I'm on a High Card build, leveling other hands is generally not relevant here, and choosing other cards for these hands just moves the game along. While Jupiter (Flush) is Level 5, it's not useful to me here. Mercury (Pair) is Level 2; and while that is an upgrade to a basic hand, it is unlikely to pay out in this build. Neptune and Saturn are level 1, and so there is no need to make those choices.\n\nI need one more card. None of the available choices benefit my current build. My best move is to select the most relevant \"next-level\" hand or simply exit the pack with a card. I have to pick. Since Mercury (Pair) is at Level 2, and Pair is the next-up hand, choosing Mercury as an upgrade is optimal. Jupiter (Flush) is at level 5, and it's less relevant to my build, which I'm not likely to pivot out of. So, Mercury it is. Mercury is in position 2. Let's go with Mercury.\n\nNow, let's analyze the steps: I see the prompt for \"Mega\" booster packs, and so, Pluto was selected. I am left with four cards. I will select Mercury (position 2).\n\nOkay, let's step back, and re-check my current state. I still have the Justice consumable. I'm in the Shop/Booster phase. I need to make sure everything else is in the correct configuration. Jokers are currently ordered: Smiley Face (1), Photograph (2), Hanging Chad (3), Stuntman (4), and Pareidolia (5). Let's review the scoring order and interactions. I'll be playing High Card -> Photograph triggers on the first face card (x2) -> Hanging Chad triggers Photograph twice more (x2, x2) -> Smiley Face (+5) triggers 3 times?\n\nI need to confirm the order of the Jokers: Hanging Chad: \"Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times.\" Photograph: \"First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored.\" Smiley Face: \"Played face cards give +5 Mult when scored.\" Pareidolia: \"All cards are face cards.\"\n\nThe sequence goes like this: 1. Base score. 2. Card triggers Smiley Face (+5). 3. Card triggers Photograph (x2). 4. Hanging Chad re-triggers the card (Smiley Face +5, Photograph x2). 5. Hanging Chad re-triggers the card again (Smiley Face +5, Photograph x2).\n\nPhotograph triggers on the same card, which is the first played one, so Photograph should trigger again. (This is a powerful interaction.)\n\nNow let's verify Stuntman. Stuntman is in position 4. It gives +10 Mult. If Stuntman is in position 4, its +10 Mult is added at step 5: \"Independent Jokers activate left-to-right\". The description of Stuntman is \"+250 Chips, -2 hand size. Secondary Description: +10 Mult.\" This is usually a static Joker effect. \"+ Mult\" Jokers that aren't \"on scored\" trigger in step 5.\n\nOk, Smiley Face and Photograph are \"on scored,\" these are step 3, so there is no disruption. Step 5 is for \"Independent\" Jokers.\n\nHere's the sequence: Step 3 (Card scores): - Smiley (+5) - Photo (x2) - Re-trigger Smiley (+5) - Re-trigger Photo (x2) - Re-trigger Smiley (+5) - Re-trigger Photo (x2) Step 5 (Independent): - Stuntman (+10 Mult).\n\nThe current order is efficient because Smiley Face's +5 is added *before* Photograph's x2 during each trigger.\n\nNow the order is verified: the +1\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
