{"reasoning":"**My Balatro Strategy: The Hermit's Wisdom**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. We're at Ante 7, Round 16, opening a Tarot Pack. Current build: High Card, aiming to leverage Pareidolia, Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman for massive face card multipliers and re-triggers. I just crushed the Big Blind with a single Red Seal 9 of Spades High Card for a hefty score. The next Boss, \"The Eye,\" is practically gift-wrapped for this build.\n\nRight now, I'm sitting on $31. The choices in front of me are: The High Priestess (Planet cards), The Hermit (money), and The Emperor (Tarot cards). I need to think carefully here. My build thrives on high card values and multipliers. I've got The World consumable but only room for one card.\n\nThe Hermit seems like the obvious play. It doubles my money up to $20, so I'll hit $51. Why is this significant? Money buys rerolls! This will give me a better chance to find Celestial Packs in the shop. With the Telescope voucher, a Celestial pack guarantees me a Pluto planet card which is ideal for a High Card build.\n\nThe High Priestess creates planets and the Emperor creates tarot cards. I *could* get lucky and find something incredibly useful. The Emperor offers a chance to get a Death card, which, if I had the Red Seal 9 of Spades in my hand, could be a game-changer. I could copy it. However, the 9 of Spades isn't in my hand, meaning Death is less useful *right now*. A Death card could also copy a 10 and enhance later.\n\nLet's look more closely at \"The Hermit\". The Hermit immediately provides a $20 boost. The High Priestess and Emperor can only create two cards if I sell or use my current \"World\" card. Hermit is the best choice to build money and scale up.\n\nI considered using \"The World\" to open space, but it's not the right play at the moment. It turns three cards to Spades. Even if I used it, I'd get two random cards. The Hermit's reliable $20 is far better to get Pluto from Celestial Packs.\n\nSo, the optimal move here is clear: **Select The Hermit**. It's the most reliable path to future scaling. My JSON input: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
