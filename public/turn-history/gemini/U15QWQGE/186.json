{"reasoning":"**Analysis of Ante 8, Round 17 Booster Pack**\n\nAlright, let's see what this pack has to offer. I'm in Ante 8, Round 17, pushing for the final ante with this High Card build. Right now, I'm rolling with some solid Jokers: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), and, the key here, Pareidolia. Pareidolia is a game-changer; it makes every card a face card, which is perfect synergy with the Jokers I have.\n\nMy High Card level is sitting at 6, which gives me a base of 55 chips and 6 Multiplier. But, with Stuntman, that jumps up to a comfortable 305 chips and 16 Multiplier. The real juice comes from those face card triggers: Smiley Face adding +5 Multiplier, and Photograph doubling it. Hanging Chad is going to be crucial here. It retriggers the first card *twice* so that all total, each card I play is going to be a: (+5 Multi, x2 Multi). So, the full multiplier progression is: 16 -> 21 -> 42 -> 47 -> 94 -> 99 -> 198. Final score, approximately 305 * 198 = ~60,390.\n\nThe pack gives me a 3 of Diamonds, a 6 of Clubs, and a 3 of Clubs. Pure, unadulterated vanilla cards. No enhancements, no seals, nothing. These cards aren't going to help me at all. They would only dilute the deck, which I *definitely* don't want. Honestly, with this deck, I'm really hoping for a Red Seal, but this just isn't worth the cards.\n\nIt's pretty clear to me that skipping the booster is the best choice here. Adding bad cards would hurt this build more than it would help. With $49 in the bank, I can reroll or grab some items from the shop if needed later. I've got the `skip_booster` command ready to go. The JSON schema check confirms: action: \"skip_booster,\" positions: null, hand type: null, estimated chips: null.\n\nJust to be absolutely certain, I'm double-checking those cards again. Yep, 3 of Diamonds, 6 of Clubs, and 3 of Clubs. Nothing special. No seals, no enhancements. Skipping this pack to protect my deck. The math checks out. I'm hitting `skip_booster`. Let's keep this momentum going!\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
