{"reasoning":"**Strategic Pack Selection: A Deep Dive**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 3, $44 in the bank, Flush on Level 4 – things are looking good. We're staring down a Standard Pack, and the options are: a 6 of Hearts (meh), a Queen of Diamonds, and a Holo 8 of Spades. The Jokers I have are: Gift Card (Holo, which means +10 Mult), Mail-In Rebate (Foil, which means +50 chips and $5 per Queen discarded), Trading Card (which destroys a discard for $3), and Photograph (doubles the Mult of the first face card).\n\nImmediately, I'm thinking about synergies. The Queen plays well with Mail-In Rebate and Photograph. A Queen in hand increases my chances to trigger Photograph. The Holo 8 provides flat +10 Mult. Considering the state of Mail-In Rebate, adding a Queen to the deck to capitalize on a rank bonus, given I'm already deep into the shop, might be short-sighted. Photograph, on the other hand, is a guaranteed multiplier on face cards, regardless of the current Mail-In Rebate rank. I also have the Trading Card to discard low-value cards.\n\nNow, for a Holo card, I can get +10 Mult, which is a good amount. The Queen provides +5 economy. I'm already quite wealthy though, so flat economy is less impactful.\n\nOkay, let's lay out the options again. The Queen gives me a $5 economy and a x2 bonus, whereas the 8 gives me +10 Mult. If the Mail-In Rebate says Queen, I discard for $5. But this bonus rank rotates, and if I pick a Queen now, it's possible that the discount will change next round. So I can only play a Queen if I have a face card in hand. The Holo 8 will give me +10 at any time.\n\nSo, I have the 6 of Hearts, the Queen, and the 8 of Spades (Holo). The Holo 8 is really good, but Photograph can make any face card (like the Queen) worth double. If I play the Holo 8, I get +10 mult on a single card. If I play the Queen, I double the entire Mult.\n\nNow, here's the calculation: Base Flush Lvl 4 gives 10. Gift Card (Holo) is +10. Total mult = 20. With the Holo 8, it's 30 mult. If I play a Queen (with Photograph), it's 40. That makes the Queen better.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Holo aspect and its rarity. Holo always adds value. However, the consistent value of a Joker is important for the early/mid game.\n\nThe Mail-In Rebate bonus goes away next round, I might not have Queens at all for that rank. If I draw the Holo 8 of Spades, that +10 is locked in. However, the Queen works every time I have a face card.\n\nLooking at the chips, I have a Flush (80 chips, 10 mult) currently. I can get about 2000 chips total. If I play the Queen: 80 * 20 = 1600. If I play 8 and have other cards, it's 2700. So the Queen is better. Plus, if I get that $5 economy it's even better!\n\nThe Holo 8 (choice 3) is good for any deck. It doesn't rely on being Queen, and it's a spade. I will still get the economy benefit as well. The Queen is a face card for Photograph, but I have other face cards in the deck.\n\nHolographic is nice in any deck. The x2 Mult (Photograph) is great. If I play the 8 of Spades Holo, I get +10 Mult on that card. If I have the Queen and other cards, I can get +20 Mult, because the +10 from the Holo is independent of the value of the other cards in the deck. The Queen becomes more important, and a Holo card is important in the deck as well. But Photograph is stronger. If I pick 2, I double the total Mult.\n\nNow, if I have any face card in play, it doubles the Mult. If I get the Holo card I double the chips of the 8. So, if I pick the Holo 8, my chips go up a lot with the other cards.\n\nActually, the Holo is better because it gives +10 to the total Mult, which then\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
