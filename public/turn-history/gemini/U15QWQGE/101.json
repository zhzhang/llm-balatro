{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decisions for Ante 5**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, with $62 in the bank. I've got a solid build going with Pareidolia, Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman. It's focused on getting massive multiplier bonuses on a single high card play, leveraging the Photograph and the Chad retriggers. The Stuntman gives a significant chip and mult boost, but reduces my hand size. The goal is to maximize this.\n\nConsidering the shop, I'm evaluating my options. The shop currently contains the following:\n*   Uranus: Skip, since I'm not playing Two Pair.\n*   Clever Joker: Skip for same reason.\n*   Shoot the Moon: Potentially good with Pareidolia, but no joker slots left.\n*   Mystic Summit: Solid mult boost, but no space again.\n*   Arcana Pack: Good for scaling, potentially Blue/Gold Seals, or transformations.\n*   Celestial Pack: Excellent for leveling High Card.\n*   Director's Cut: A safety net if a nasty boss appears.\n\nI'm thinking I should check those boosters *before* committing to the Director's Cut voucher. Given my current strategy, leveling up High Card is probably the most immediate impact. I've got five jokers and I can sell the Smiley Face if I get a better joker.\n\nHowever, the previous turn had a slight error in it as I thought I had a \"Blue Seal 10 of Diamonds\" which I did not have, and if I did have, I would need a Consumable slot.\n\nOkay, let's look at the best play here. While the Arcana pack is tempting for long-term scaling, High Card scaling is the most direct benefit right now. I should buy the Celestial Pack first. So I'll initiate the following:\n\nAction: `buy_booster`\nPosition: 2 (Celestial Pack)\n\nReasoning: Leveling High Card directly boosts the core of my current strategy. I can afford it with $62, and it is positioned as the 2nd booster.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
