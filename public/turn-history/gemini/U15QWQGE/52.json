{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis: Ante 3, Round 4**\n\nAlright, I'm in the Shop phase of Balatro, Ante 3, Round 4. I've got $45 to play with. My immediate goal is to maximize the run's potential. My current build revolves around the synergy between `Photograph` and `Hanging Chad` with face cards. `Gift Card` is fantastic for scaling sell value and provides +10 Mult (Holo). `Mail-In Rebate` is decent for its chip and money generation based on discarded 9s, and `Trading Card` is helping with money and deck thinning.\n\nThe cards in the shop aren't particularly appealing: `Walkie Talkie` isn't relevant to my face card focus, and the offered Joker is weak compared to what I already have. I'm sitting on 5 Jokers right now, and to buy a new one, I'd have to sell one.\n\nConsidering my cash, and keeping in mind the interest caps, I need to decide if a reroll is worth it. Rerolling costs $5. I'm really hoping to find better consumables, like Planets (particularly Jupiter for Flushes) or impactful Tarot cards. My hand levels are decent, Flush is level 4, and Full House is Level 2. My `Justice` tarot is for glass card enhancement, which I'll save for later. I've primarily been playing Flushes, and my last played hand was a Flush with 5070 points.\n\nGiven the existing Jokers, and with $45, I can afford to reroll a few times and still stay above the interest cap. The interest calculation is $1 for every $5, up to a max of $5 total. I have $20 \"excess\" money.\n\nThe `Gift Card` description just popped up in my mind, \"Add $1 of sell value to every Joker and Consumable card at end of round.\" This makes keeping my Jokers an even better decision.\n\nSo, should I reroll?\n\nGiven my current hand, a single reroll is a low-risk strategy. I'm searching for a Planet card or a better Joker or Tarot. Therefore, I will **reroll_shop**.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
