{"reasoning":"Okay, let's break this down. **I'm at Ante 3, Round 4, with $40. My current Joker setup is pretty strong, built around a key Photograph + Hanging Chad synergy.** Right now, I have: a Gift Card (Holo), which is a flat +10 Mult and scales sell value; Mail-In Rebate (Foil), giving me +50 Chips and $5 for each discarded 9; a Trading Card, which destroys a card on the first discard for $3; a Photograph, doubling the mult of the first face card scored; and a Hanging Chad, which retriggers the first played card twice. I also have a Justice consumable (Glass Card). I have an Overstock voucher.\n\nThe core of this strategy is clear: use Hanging Chad to trigger Photograph multiple times on a face card. If I play a face card first, Hanging Chad will retrigger it three times, resulting in a nice multiplier (X8) from Photograph. Then, the +10 Mult from the Gift Card (Holo) will add to that value. I'm not seeing any good +Mult jokers in the shop that are worth selling my current Jokers for. I need to keep an eye on Mail-In Rebate, as the rank could change.\n\nThe shop has some common, weak +Mult jokers (Zany, Crazy, Wrathful), but they don't fit my current plan. I'm at 5/5 Jokers, so I can't buy any without selling one. I have $40, which means I can afford a few rerolls without losing interest, which caps at $25.\n\nWhat I'm really looking for in the shop are Planets (Jupiter for Flush), or Tarots/Spectrals that boost face cards (Strength to make cards face cards or Death to clone them). The Justice card is ready to be used on a face card this round. The current reroll cost is $6.\n\nGiven the bad shop offerings, I'm thinking of rerolling. I've got enough money to do so and still be above the interest cap. The question is, should I? Ante 3 is usually manageable. I *could* save money for future jumps, but right now the shop's looking weak. Given the bad cards, I will reroll once. I'll also have a look at Mail-In Rebate.\n\n**Let's think about the Joker order, and how they score.** My optimal order is: Gift Card (for its +Mult), Mail-In Rebate (+Chips), Trading Card, Photograph (for its multiplier), and Hanging Chad (for retriggering). The order matters, because of how the scoring works. The Photograph triggers \"when scored,\" and Hanging Chad retriggers \"when scored.\" Gift Card's Holo effect happens at step 5. The basic scoring sequence goes like this: 1) Hand level is scored. 2) Played cards score. This includes card chips, card enhancements (like Glass), and \"On Scored\" jokers (Photograph). 3) Hanging Chad retriggers the card in step 3. 4) \"Independent\" Jokers activate left-to-right (basic Joker, editions on Jokers) (Gift Card).\n\nThis is actually slightly inefficient since Photograph multiplies before my +Mult. I need to find +Mult jokers that trigger in Step 3. Otherwise, the +10 is added *after* the multiplier from the Photograph.\n\nLet me make this clear. Example: Base Mult 10.\n*   Step 3: Card scores. Photograph X2. Chad retriggers. Mult becomes $10 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 80$.\n*   Step 5: Holo Gift Card +10. Mult becomes $80 + 10 = 90$.\n\nIf I had +Mult that triggered in Step 3: $(10 + 10) \\times 8 = 160$.\n\nThis means the best possible world is to find a +Mult that triggers in Step 3.\n\n**Given all that, the plan is to reroll the shop.**\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
