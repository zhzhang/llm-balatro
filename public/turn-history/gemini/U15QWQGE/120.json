{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 5/8, Round 11, and I'm at the shop. My goal is clear: maximize score for future blinds, especially the Boss Blind, \"The Mark,\" which requires a whopping 22,000 chips. I have $37 to work with, and I need to optimize this shop visit for long-term scaling, particularly around my High Card strategy.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid right now: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. The current engine is strong, but there's room to improve. The base setup is (Mult + Stuntman Holo 10 + Smiley 5)*2 -> (+5)*2 -> (+5)*2.\n\nLet's break down the shop items. `Mega Celestial Pack` is top priority. Leveling up High Card with Pluto is the best long-term scaling for this build, no question. The `Arcana Pack` is also interesting for economy or deck manipulation, but Pluto is the priority.\n\n`Card Sharp` is incredibly tempting. With my High Card build, playing multiple High Cards per round could be hugely beneficial, especially if score requirements ramp up. The question is, which Joker do I sell to make room? Smiley Face with Hanging Chad adds +15 mult total with the x2 bonus, Photograph multiplies the base by x8, and Hanging Chad drives the whole engine. Stuntman's +250 chips is amazing for High Card, and Pareidolia enables the face card synergy.\n\nThinking it through, the current engine is (Mult + 10 Stuntman Holo + 5 Smiley) and then it is then multiplied by the Photography x2/x2/x2. Let me compare, with Card Sharp, (Mult) * 8 * 3 = Mult * 24. With Smiley Face, (Mult + 15) * 8. This math favors Card Sharp *if* I play a second hand, but Smiley Face works on the *first* hand.\n\nSo, here's my plan. I need to get rid of Smiley Face.\n\nAbstract Joker is +15 Mult, but it's less impactful than Smiley Face (before the multiplication), so I won't buy it. I need to get Pluto, and the Arcana Pack is also helpful.\n\nGiven I'm at $37 and the interest cap is $25, I have $12 to spend. I'll buy the `Mega Celestial Pack` for $8 first, leaving me with $29. That's still above the interest cap, so the next item to buy is `Arcana Pack`.\n\nSo, the action will be to `buy_booster` the Mega Celestial Pack from the first position. Let's get that Pluto!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
