{"reasoning":"**Current Thinking: High Card Strategy with Steel Card Optimization**\n\nOkay, so we're in Ante 5/8, Round 10. Jumbo Standard Pack, $25 on hand, nice. My current setup: Smiley Face (x5 mult per retrigger), Photograph (x2 mult per retrigger), Hanging Chad (retrigger on the first card played 2 times), Stuntman (+250 chips, -2 hand size, +10 Holo Mult), and Pareidolia (makes all cards face cards). The Justice consumable is in my back pocket for now.\n\nThe plan is High Card, using only face cards. Thanks to Pareidolia, this is easy as all the cards count.\n\nMy hand: Queen of Clubs (+10 chips), 4 of Spades (+4 chips), 2 of Hearts (Bonus +30 chips), 3 of Clubs (+3 chips), and a Queen of Hearts (Steel Card: x1.5 mult while held).\n\nLet's break down the options. The Queens, obviously, are face cards, but Pareidolia covers that anyway. The Bonus card (+30 chips) is tempting, because it gives an immediate chips boost if played and retriggered. However, considering Stuntman's contribution (+250 chips), the impact is reduced. The Steel Queen of Hearts, though, that's where things get interesting. It's a flat x1.5 multiplier at the end of the round. My hand size is reduced by two because of Stuntman, which means I can afford to hold onto a single card easily. This is mathematically better than the chip boost!\n\nI've got a hand size of 6, and I want to play a single card. I can easily hold onto one Steel card and achieve this.\n\nThe Steel Queen of Hearts is clearly the play here. It's a direct multiplicative boost after all the other additive mult and Photograph x2 triggers.\n\nSo, the optimal choice is to select the Queen of Hearts (position 5). No other card or action seems better in this situation. Justice won't do much on this hand, and skipping is definitely not a good idea with that Steel card.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
