{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Maximizing Value**\n\nOkay, so we're at Round 2, the Big Blind is down, and we're heading into the Boss Blind. Currently sitting on $26, and it's time to hit the SHOP. I've got a Gift Card (Holo), Mail-In Rebate (Foil), Trading Card, and Photograph. The goal here is to carefully evaluate the shop options, understanding that a single misstep can be costly.\n\nLet's break down the shop offerings: Lusty Joker seems weak in my current setup. I'm prioritizing Gift Card and Photograph for mult. A Celestial Pack is tempting. Leveling up my hands early is a solid strategy. Reroll Surplus is good for the long run but it's $10 and I want to stay near that $25 interest threshold.\n\nMy initial thought was to grab the Celestial Pack *after* Photograph, but I need to do a little more digging.\n\nBuying the Celestial Pack for $4 seems smart. That would leave me with $22, which means I will lose $1 of interest next round, going from $5 to $4. However, the Celestial Pack looks like the best value here. I'll make up for it later. Leveling up hands is important, and I need to keep money over $20 to get the bonus.\n\nNow, let's nail down how Photograph and Gift Card's effects stack.  Photograph's \"x2 Mult\" triggers \"on scored,\" while the Gift Card gives me +10 Mult, specifically from the Holo edition. Let's see... the game rules mention the order of operations. Step 3 covers scored cards and \"on scored\" jokers, while Step 5 covers \"Independent\" Jokers (basic Joker, editions on Jokers).\n\nSo, the rules are:\n1.  Boss Blind\n2.  \"On played\" Jokers\n3.  Played cards score... \"On scored\" Jokers. Photograph is here.\n4.  Held-in-hand\n5.  \"Independent\" Jokers activate left-to-right (basic Joker, editions on Jokers). Gift Card is here.\n\nAlright, so the Holo Gift Card's +10 Mult is technically part of its edition. Thus, it's an \"Independent\" Joker that triggers in Step 5. Photograph is in Step 3. So the x2 from Photograph should happen *before* the Gift Card. This means I want as much mult as possible *before* the x2 is applied. Let's make an example: A Pair (2 mult). Photograph will double that, resulting in 4 mult. The Gift Card adds the +10 on top, yielding 14. Let's check: 2 + 10 = 12. 12 \\* 2 = 24.  So it makes *no* difference. The x2 *does* happen before the +10 mult, regardless.  Photograph, because it triggers in Step 3, before Step 5 (Gift Card), multiplies the hand mult first. It doesn't matter because the triggers are in different steps.  The *order* of Photograph and Gift Card doesn't matter, but if I had *multiple* jokers that trigger in Step 5, that's when it would matter. I'll have to keep this in mind as I build my deck.\n\nThe user's previous reasoning involved getting the Celestial Pack. Let's do it. It's $4, which brings me to $22. I'm okay with that.\n\nThere's no point in buying Lusty Joker. Reroll Surplus is tempting, but right now, I need to keep money over $20. Buying the pack seems best. Leveling up the hands is important right now.\n\nMy Joker order is: 1: Gift Card (Holo), 2: Mail-In Rebate (Foil), 3: Trading Card, 4: Photograph.\n\nMail-In Rebate adds chips on scored, similar to Photograph, so its positioning doesn't change anything for the mult calculation, so my order is fine.\n\nOkay, let's buy that Celestial Pack. It's the right choice. My current money is $26. $26 - $4 = $22. Yes, I'll have $4 interest instead of $5, but the upgrade is worth it.\n\nSo, the action is to `buy_booster`, with arguments `[1]` for the Celestial Pack. And that's the plan. I'll stick to it. I want to save for the $25 Investment Tag bonus. Then I'll have $50+. Final answer: `buy_booster` \\[1].\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
