{"reasoning":"**Ante 4 Shop Phase: A Deep Dive into Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm staring down the barrel of the Boss Blind, and my primary objective is to maximize my chip count. I've got $59, and my Joker setup is *chef's kiss*. Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia – it's a beautifully synergistic machine. With Pareidolia turning everything into face cards, Chad's retriggers, and Photograph and Smiley Face stacking multipliers, I'm already in a strong position.\n\nI've got Justice and The World for consumables, a somewhat uninspiring shop selection (Hallucination, Ride the Bus, Venus, Juggler) and the boosters are Mega Standard and Arcana. My initial thought is Hallucination is tempting for Tarot cards, but I'm Joker-locked and happy with my engine. Ride the Bus is a non-starter with Pareidolia, and while Venus (Three of a Kind upgrade) is cheap, my focus is High Card/Flush. Juggler is hand size, good with Stuntman, but I'm torn. The Mega Standard Pack adds deck cards, and the Arcana Pack is Tarots, which I always like.\n\nJuggler is the main dilemma. Do I sell Stuntman (chip provider, -2 hand size) or maybe Pareidolia (makes it all work, so no). Probably not. My money situation is great (interest is irrelevant right now). I'm sitting on $59, well above the $25 interest cap. Spending down to $25 is effectively \"free\" money.\n\nSo, I'm looking for high value, the Arcana Pack for $4 would be useful, but I have a full consumable inventory. I'm locked out until I sell one. My High Card level is 1 and Flush is 4, so Venus (Three of a Kind planet card) could be useful, but is that a priority? Time to assess the Boss Blind, \"The Psychic - Must play 5 cards\". My current strategy, a single, high-scoring card, is the antithesis of this requirement! To be able to be sure I have 5 cards, this might sway me towards buying Juggler.\n\nI'm thinking, do I buy Venus? Do I reroll? No, let's open something first. I'll open a Mega Standard Pack to see if there's a good card in there.\n\nLast played hand: 60,822 chips. The Big Blind required 7,500 and the boss needs 10,000. I'm absolutely crushing the chip requirements, and I've got a lot of disposable income. But then, I have The World and Justice (my consumables). Hmm. Should I buy and use Venus?\n\nIs there a better play? Let's buy the pack. Then, what about the seal cards? I want one to be \"primary\", even though that's not what the game is about. I'll take a look at my hand size again to plan for the Boss Blind. Okay, Stuntman is -2 hand size. 8-2 = 6. With 6 cards, playing a specific high-ranking card and then 4 others is going to be easy.\n\nThere's no reason *not* to buy the Mega Standard Pack. It's safe. What about the Arcana Pack? I have to sell a consumable. I like Justice. The World is okay. Maybe sell The World to open the pack?\n\nI'll start with the Mega Standard Pack. Then, let's look at the Jokers again, just in case. Now's the time to find out if I should sell one. My focus is on \"Blueprint\", \"Brainstorm\", or \"Mime\" but no, I'll need all the ones I have.\n\nStep 1: Buy Mega Standard Pack? Or Venus? Or Reroll? Let's buy the Mega Standard Pack first.\n\nWait, I need the action JSON. `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\nBut wait, I need to check the Mega Standard Pack description. \"Choose 2 of up to 5 Playing cards.\" So, it's not the best deal. Standard packs are generally low value unless you're looking for something specific. Arcana packs are usually better. Should I sell \"The World\" to open the Arcana pack? No, with Pareidolia, suit doesn't matter for the Mult engine, only for Flushes. But my High Card is doing 60k, which is way more than the 10k needed. Flushes aren't necessary.\n\nLet's buy the Mega Standard Pack. It's the most expensive\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
