{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 5, Round 11, and I'm in the shop with $29. My build is set up for High Card, leaning heavily on Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Pareidolia for some serious mult. I've got Smiley Face, Photograph x2, Hanging Chad x3, Stuntman Holo, and Pareidolia, plus a Justice consumable. I've also got a few vouchers: Overstock, Overstock Plus, and Director's Cut. My High Card level is at 2 with a base of 15 Chips and 2 Mult; my Pair level is 3 with 40 Chips and 4 Mult.\n\nThe shop offers are: Card Sharp, Shoot the Moon, The Moon, and Abstract Joker, plus an Arcana Pack booster. I need to figure out the optimal move here, accounting for economy and my overall strategy.\n\nI am strongly considering *not* touching the jokers in this shop phase; the current line-up is ideal. My primary objective is a high-powered High Card engine, and that relies on the Photograph x2 on first face card, Hanging Chad to retrigger it, and Pareidolia to make *all* cards face cards. With Smiley, I am looking at a massive mult on the first card, and this helps the high card build tremendously. The Stuntman Holo chip and mult boost is solid too.\n\nI started crunching numbers: with my current setup, my first played card is estimated to have a mult of 96, and a total chip value of (15 + card chips + 250) * 96. If I bought Card Sharp and sold Smiley, I could get a x3 mult, but the calculation with the retriggering is far more complex:\n\n*   The key with this is the \"On scored\" Jokers and how the effects cascade: Smiley's +5 is applied *before* the Photograph's x2 multiplier. Hanging Chad retriggers this entire sequence. So, with Smiley, I get (((Base Mult + 5) \\* 2 + 5) \\* 2 + 5) \\* 2 = 96 mult.\n*   If I replaced Smiley with Card Sharp and played a High Card, it would be base \\* 2 \\* 2 \\* 2 (26 mult) \\* 3.\n*   The math without Smiley: (2 * 2 * 2) \\* 2 + 10 (Stuntman), then \\* 3 (Card Sharp). This results in 78.\n*   If I kept Smiley: (((2 + 5) * 2 + 5) * 2 + 5) * 2 + 10 = 96.\n*   If I had Smiley and Card Sharp I could do (((((2 + 5) * 2 + 5) * 2 + 5) * 2 + 10) \\* 3.\n*   So I could do (((((2 + 5) * 2 + 5) * 2 + 5) * 2 + 10) * 3, I am only getting a 26 mult without smiley.\n\nI then did the math for the mults:\n*   I have 70 from the multipliers. Replacing Smiley Face with the x3 would be 26 * 3 = 78. *Smiley Face is still better in my current state.*\n\n*Arcana Pack* costs $4, which leaves me with $25—perfectly at the interest cap. I always like to see what the boosters have. The other shop cards are not relevant to my current build (Abstract Joker gives +15 Mult when Smiley gives effectively +70 mult, and I am not holding clubs so Shoot the Moon is worthless). The booster is the right choice.\n\nOkay, let's recheck the joker order. Current order is: Smiley, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. \"On scored\" Jokers trigger in order and so this is optimal. I checked it so that it will be optimal for all hands, not just the first one.\n\nTherefore, the best move: I will *buy the Arcana Pack* and re-evaluate, as always. With $29, buy_booster 1 leaves me with $25. *Done*.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
