{"reasoning":"**Current Strategic Assessment: Ante 5, Round 11**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I'm in a solid position. My build is centered around a High Card strategy, heavily reliant on a few key Jokers. Pareidolia is the foundation, making all cards face cards, which synergizes perfectly with Photograph, Smiley Face, and Hanging Chad. Stuntman provides that essential chip boost.\n\nMy initial calculations show that with this setup, a single High Card should score around 45,650 chips. This should be more than enough to handle the Blind's demands, considering Ante 5's requirements.\n\nThe shop is currently offering Scholar, Juggler, Red Card, and Business Card. None of these are appealing enough to warrant a change in my current Joker lineup. Selling one would be madness. The economy isn't the problem here, the Jokers I have are. I am happy with my economy, I don't need any gold-generating jokers. Rerolling is a no-go; it's too expensive and I don't need anything in this shop. I'm already at the interest cap, so there's nothing to gain.\n\nMy Joker order is: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. This order is *critical* for maximizing the multiplier on each trigger of the first card. I did a double-check on that. The Smiley Face adds its mult, *then* the Photograph doubles it. This setup is optimal.\n\nI have two Tarot cards (The World, The Hierophant) that I can't use until the round starts, so I have a little extra flexibility. If, say, a *really* attractive joker shows up on the next shop, I might consider sacrificing one to buy it. Though, that's not a strong consideration right now.\n\nNo need to rearrange the Jokers. The current shop is useless to me. I'm going to proceed to the next round. I'm confident in my decision.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
