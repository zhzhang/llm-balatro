{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Tarot Pack Selection**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 6/8, Big Blind, Arcana Pack. I'm sitting on $33 and a killer joker lineup: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad (Holo), Stuntman (Holo), and Pareidolia, which effectively makes all cards face cards. My hand's alright: 3 of Spades, King and Queen of Hearts (Foil!), 5 of Hearts, King of Diamonds, and Jack of Diamonds. My current strategy is High Card, which levels at 4 and gives 35 chips, 4x mult.\n\nThe critical decision is the booster pack. The Moon to change 3 to clubs? Unnecessary. I'd need a flush for that. The Hanged Man to destroy cards? Tempting to make space, but with Pareidolia, thinning the deck is less critical. That leaves The Magician which enhances cards, and that's where I need to be.\n\nThe Magician can enhance two cards. I'm looking at those high-value cards I can play for High Card. Positions 2 (King of Hearts) and 3 (Queen of Hearts - and it's Foil, for even more bonus chips!). This is a no-brainer.\n\nI've got to check the joker order. Let's see...1: Smiley, 2: Photograph, 3: Hanging Chad, 4: Stuntman, 5: Pareidolia. This is the optimal sequence for maximum mult. Smiley (additive) before Photograph (multiplicative) maximizes the returns with Hanging Chad re-triggering. That means I need to make sure that Smiley (+5 Mult) is before Photograph (x2 Mult) to optimize the re-triggers.\n\nHere's the scoring sequence: Base (4) -> Smiley (+5) -> Photograph (x2) -> Hanging Chad re-trigger (Smiley, Photograph x2) -> Hanging Chad re-trigger (Smiley, Photograph x2) -> Stuntman (+10). Each re-trigger with Photograph doubles the previous result, so the order is crucial. The Stuntman at the end adds a flat 10 Mult.\n\nCalculating potential: Base (35 chips) + Q (60)+Stuntman (250) = 345 chips\nMult: Base (4) -> Smiley (9) -> Photo (18) -> Chad 1 (46) -> Chad 2 (102) -> Stuntman (112)\nChips = 345, Mult = 112 -> 38,640.\n\nMagician enhances cards at positions 2 and 3. The command is `select 2 2 3`.\n\nDouble checking, The Hanged Man to thin the deck isn't as good as enhancing. I'm prioritizing immediate scoring potential with the Magician. The World (Spades) and Hierophant (Bonus Cards) can be saved for later.\n\nCommand syntax: `select <pack_card_position> <target_card_position1> <target_card_position2>`.\n\nFinal decision: Pack 2 (The Magician), target cards at hand positions 2 and 3 (King of Hearts and Queen of Hearts). This should secure the win.\n\nI need to confirm the JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2, 2, 3]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,2,3]"}
