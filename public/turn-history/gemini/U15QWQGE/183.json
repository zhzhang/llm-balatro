{"reasoning":"**Ante 8 Decision: Celestial Pack Buy**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 8, final ante! Time to focus. This High Card build has been working well, but it's the end game, and the boss blinds can be brutal. Let's make sure I'm doing everything right.\n\nCurrently, I have $57. The hand is High Card, level 5. I've got a solid Joker setup with Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. This gives me a good multiplier engine; Pareidolia turns everything into faces, ensuring maximum benefit from Smiley Face and Photograph. Stuntman is my chip powerhouse, and Hanging Chad helps retrigger.\n\nLooking at the shop, *Ice Cream* is a potential chip boost, but Stuntman covers that. *Midas Mask* generates money but scoring is more crucial now. *The Magician* could be useful, but is inconsistent. *Sly Joker* is useless. I need scoring.\n\nThe *Standard Pack* might give me a good card but the *Celestial Pack* is what I *need*. Because of the Telescope voucher, I *know* it will contain Pluto. This will level up my High Card and get me more chips and multi. I can't leave this to chance. *Tarot Merchant* is an option, but the current build is very consistent.\n\nSo, I need to get that Celestial Pack. It's position 2 in the booster section of the shop. I have the money.\n\nThe only consumable I have is \"The World,\" which changes cards to spades. Not useful at all for High Card, so no need to sell it.\n\nThe JSON is straightforward: I need to output `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}` to get the pack.\n\nDouble checking, the Celestial Pack is in the correct position. Yes. And that's what I want.\n\nSo, here it is:\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
