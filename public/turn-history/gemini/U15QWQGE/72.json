{"reasoning":"**Balatro: Shop Strategy - The Plan Evolves**\n\nAlright, here we are at Ante 6, with $55 burning a hole in my pocket. The core of the build is solid: Stuntman providing chips, Photograph and Hanging Chad for multiplication, and the Gift Card for a nice mult boost and increasing the sell values of consumables. The immediate goal is to maximize my multiplication before that crucial X2 trigger from Photograph. Let's get these jokers in order. Gift Card (Holo, hopefully +20 Mult), Trading Card, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman.\n\nMy strategy needs +Mult that triggers \"on scoring.\" I remember Even Steven being the perfect, however, it does not apply to face cards. The potential I calculated here is insane, though! If I can find a Face Card (especially with an enhancement) that I can use with Justice, I'm talking about a potential for X64 Mult!\n\nGiven the current shop, I'm seeing \"The World,\" \"Oops! All 6s,\" \"Zany Joker,\" and \"Even Steven\". Also a standard pack. Right now, Oops and Zany are irrelevant. \"Even Steven\" is alright at the moment, but the Standard Pack has some serious potential. Standard Pack has great value here for enhancing my build. So I'm thinking about buying the Standard Pack first to maximize potential for the current hand. However, the plan is to buy \"The World\" as well to maximize my Gift Card value.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'll buy the Standard Pack first. I'm hoping for a face card or something with a cool enhancement. Then, I'll buy \"The World\" before I move on. I *could* reroll and hope for even better jokers or tarots, but the pack could be great for the moment. My hand is only 6 now (thanks, Stuntman), so thinning with Trading Card is going to be important in the long run.\n\nAlright, standard pack and \"The World,\" let's go!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
