{"reasoning":"**Current Balatro Decision: Spectral Pack Acquisition**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 15. The immediate goal is to select the next action. My current hand is optimized around getting the most value out of face cards with a focus on a high card.\n\nI have Telescope ($0) and $32 to spend. The shop is offering two packs, Spectral and Arcana, each for $4. I've already evaluated my Jokers: Smiley Face (adds mult), Photograph (doubles the first face card), Hanging Chad (retriggers the first played card), Stuntman (Holo + mult), and Pareidolia (all cards are face cards).\n\nI want to get even better, with bonus/mult on cards.\n\nThe Spectral Pack is tempting because it has a high variance and potential for big plays. Let's analyze the Spectral cards: Ankh is weak here. Hex could be a game-changer but risky. Ectoplasm would kill my hand. Sigil is pointless as I am playing High Card. Ouija is also bad. Grim/Incantation/Talisman are okay but not amazing. Aura is very interesting. Wraith is too risky with my money. Cryptid is also interesting.\n\nThe Arcana Pack, on the other hand, is a generally safe pick for money and planets. I am looking for the highest mult I can get. I need to keep playing High Cards. The cards in the Arcana Pack can help improve my planets.\n\nAfter evaluating the options, I think the Spectral Pack is the best choice. My current Jokers already have good synergy. The Spectral Pack has Aura and Cryptid, and both are high-value. This will cost $4, leaving me with $28. My interest is likely at the cap.\n\nSo the plan is: Buy Spectral Pack (Booster 2).\nThe action is: buy_booster 2\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
