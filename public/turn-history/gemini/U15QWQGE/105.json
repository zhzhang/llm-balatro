{"reasoning":"**My Current Game State Analysis & Action Plan**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5/8, Round 9. I'm running a High Card strategy with the Arcana Pack, using the TAROT_PACK game step. My goal is to hit the chip threshold, and I've got a killer Joker setup: Smiley Face (+5 Mult), Photograph (x2 Mult on the first face card), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card 2x), Stuntman (+250 chips, +10 Mult, -2 hand size), and Pareidolia (all cards are face cards).\n\nMy current hand is: 5 of Spades, 9 of Spades (Red Seal - retrigger once), 5 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds (Foil). I have $54 in the bank.\n\nRight now, I'm holding *Death* in my Pack, and it's absolutely key to my strategy. *Death* lets me \"select 2 cards, convert the left card into the right card.\" My immediate, optimal play here is to leverage that Red Seal 9 of Spades. I want to duplicate it.\n\nI've already rearranged my hand so that the 5 of Spades is in position 1, and the 9 of Spades is in position 2. I need to select the pack card (Death) and then the two target cards in the hand: the 5 of Spades and the 9 of Spades. Since Death will convert the 'left' card to the 'right' card (and I've already confirmed with the schema), selecting those positions will duplicate the 9 of Spades.\n\nTherefore, my command is `select 2 1 2` where `2` is the position of Death, `1` is the position of the 5 of Spades, and `2` is the position of the 9 of Spades. This action will be \"select\", with positions `[2, 1, 2]`. This sets me up perfectly to then play that duplicated 9 of Spades to maximize my re-triggers with Hanging Chad, Photograph, and Smiley Face for massive scaling. No `intended_hand_type` or `estimated_chips` are required for this `select` step. This is the optimal play for this setup.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,2]"}
