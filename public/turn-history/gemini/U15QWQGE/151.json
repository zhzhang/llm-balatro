{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Arcana Pack: A Focus on Maximum High Card Scoring**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6, Round 14. We're in the Arcana Pack phase. I need to maximize my High Card score with this hand. I have $29 and a hand size of 6, reduced by Stuntman. My Jokers are Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), and Pareidolia. The optimal order is Chad -> Smiley/Photograph -> Stuntman.\n\nMy inventory order: Smiley, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. This order impacts the triggers. I will be playing a High Card. Hanging Chad retriggers the first card played 2 times. If I play a single card (High Card), it triggers 1 (base) + 2 (Chad) = 3 times.\n\nMy scoring sequence, then, will be: Card scores, Smiley, Photograph, Chad, Chad, Stuntman.\n\nLet's calculate the multiplier potential: Base Mult (4) -> +5 (Smiley) = 9 -> x2 (Photograph) = 18. Retrigger 1: +5 (Smiley) = 23 -> x2 (Photograph) = 46. Retrigger 2: +5 (Smiley) = 51 -> x2 (Photograph) = 102. Stuntman: +10 (Holo) = 112. Total Mult: 112. This is correct.\n\nNow, the Arcana pack choices: The Star (convert to diamonds, useless), The Magician (enhance to Lucky Cards), and The Fool (creates last Tarot, i.e., Magician). Given my full inventory (The World, The Hierophant), I cannot add The Fool's Magician. The Magician from the pack immediately applies.\n\nMy hand consists of a 10 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 3 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs (Foil: +50), Queen of Diamonds, and 7 of Diamonds. I'm focusing on High Card. From the last turn, I used The Magician.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to enhance the Jack of Clubs (Foil) and the Queen of Diamonds.\n\nThe Magician is the only reasonable choice. \"The Fool\" is redundant, as it attempts to add to a full inventory.\n\nI should select the Magician and apply it to cards 4 (Jack) and 5 (Queen).\n\nI calculate the potential score, given the High Card and the Lucky card chances. This is potentially huge.\n\nInitial card score: 35 (Level 4 High Card) + 10 (Jack) + 50 (Foil) + 250 (Stuntman) = 345 chips.\nMult: 112 (calculated earlier).\nTotal score: 345 * 112 = 38,640.\n\nIf Lucky:\nInitial: 4 (Base) + 20 (Lucky chance) + 5 (Smiley) = 29 -> x2 (Photo) = 58.\nRetrigger 1: +20 (Lucky) + 5 (Smiley) = 83 -> x2 (Photo) = 166.\nRetrigger 2: +20 (Lucky) + 5 (Smiley) = 191 -> x2 (Photo) = 382.\nStuntman: +10 = 392.\n345 * 392 = 135,240 chips.\n\nI need the \"select\" action, with pack card position 2 (The Magician) and targets 4 (Jack) and 5 (Queen). So: `select 2 4 5`. This is the best move. It avoids inventory management and gets me the enhancement immediately.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,4,5]"}
