{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Strategy: Buying Justice and Potential Reroll**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. We're in Ante 3, Round 3, with $44. We have a solid starting hand with a Flush at Level 4 (80 chips, 10 mult) and a Full House at Level 2 (65 chips, 6 mult). We're focused on Flush builds. We need to boost our scoring potential. I have some good Jokers to work with: Gift Card (+10 Mult, sells for $6), Mail-In Rebate (+50 Chips, sells for $5), Trading Card (Destroys a card for $3), and Photograph (x2 Mult on first face card, sells for $3).\n\nThe shop offers two cards: *Superposition*, and *Justice*. *Superposition* is useless for us. *Justice* is the clear winner: it enhances a card to Glass (x2 Mult when scored). Since I have 0/2 consumables, this is an excellent pick, especially with Gift Card increasing its sell value. I'll buy it and hold it to use on a high-value card for a massive scoring boost.\n\nI'm checking the reasoning and action: `buy_card 2` to add Justice. Okay, the schema says to use `buy_card` for individual cards in the shop and consumable types with a target.\n\nAfter buying *Justice*, I'll have $41. I need to make a decision about the reroll. Rerolling costs $5, and I still have an open Joker slot. It's probably worth it to try and find a better Joker for better scoring.\n\nI've looked at the last action and confirmed the Standard Pack is gone.\n\nSo, let's buy *Justice* (`buy_card 2`). Buying it is the priority for the hand.\n\nNow, let's review our Joker order. Gift Card has a Holo edition which gives +10 mult, and Photograph says the first face card played is x2 mult when scored. Joker editions happen after the \"on scored\" effects. So there isn't a way to arrange them for a better result, since Photograph triggers \"On scored\".\n\nSo the action is: `buy_card 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
