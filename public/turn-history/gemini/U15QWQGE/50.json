{"reasoning":"**My Current Assessment and Plan**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. It's Round 4, Big Blind, ante 3/8. I've got $49, and my strategy is crystal clear at this point: exploit the hell out of Photograph and Hanging Chad. I have a Gift Card (Holo, +10 Mult), Mail-In Rebate (Foil, +50 Chips), Trading Card (destroy 1 card on first discard for $3), Photograph (X2 Mult on first face card), and Hanging Chad (retrigger first card). I also have Justice (Glass card) in my consumables. The goal is to start with a face card, like my Queen of Hearts, that I just got the spectral pack on.\n\nThe Photograph/Hanging Chad combo is insanely powerful: Face card scores, Photo triggers (X2), Chad triggers twice, and Photo triggers twice each time. We're talking a *potential* X8 Mult from the Photograph alone if it's a face card. Then the Gift Card gives another +10 Mult. The Mail-In Rebate gives +50 Chips.\n\nI need to make smart choices. I have Overstock as a voucher.\n\nHere's the store: Walkie Talkie ($4), Joker ($2), Standard Pack ($4). I don't need Walkie Talkie because I am face-card-centric now. The Joker is too weak. The Standard Pack might give me another face card or enhancement, which is perfect.\n\nThe card scoring order is crucial. The order is: card scoring (base, modifiers, 'On scored' jokers, retriggers), then 'Independent' Jokers. In this case the Photograph is \"On scored,\" which always triggers *before* the flat +10 Mult from the Gift Card's Holo edition. The Holo edition should, in general, be behind (right-most) to maximize the multiplier. In this case, it doesn't matter, since there are no +Mult cards that I can control that would change this.\n\nI have $49 and the interest is capped at $25. No reason to save money. The Standard Pack is the best bet here, since I'm going for face card synergy. I can discard one card thanks to the Trading Card. It is important to remember that I want to destroy the non-face cards on the first discard.\n\nI should buy the Standard Pack to see if I can get another face card. Then I want to assess my face card options.\n\nI have Justice (Glass card) that will double a card's mult. It'll be amazing on a high-value face card. With the current Queen of Hearts, I'd get the maximum multiplier from that card, and the Hanging Chad, and the Photograph! I must save Justice for later. I can't use it in the shop anyway; it must be used on cards in hand. I am already using the Aura on the Queen of Hearts!\n\n**Decision:** I'm buying the Standard Pack.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
