{"reasoning":"**My Analytical Approach to the Shop**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 3/8, $48 in the bank, and the game is pushing me towards a decision. I've got a Flush at Level 4 and a Full House at Level 2, so the focus is deck optimization for those hands. I've got room for one more Joker, and my current lineup is decent.\n\nThe shop presents some interesting choices. *Superposition* is a non-starter; I'm not playing straights, so creating Tarots for that hand is irrelevant. *Justice* is a potential high-value consumable, which can be enhanced to Glass, effectively doubling its mult. However, I can't use it immediately. Then there's the *Standard Pack*. I can buy it for $4. I should do that. It offers a chance to either improve my existing deck (especially if I get a Queen for *Mail-In Rebate*, or a card to destroy with *Trading Card* for a quick $3).\n\nMy initial thought was to pick up *Justice* as a hold, given its ability to be worth more with *Gift Card*. I see that *Gift Card* is in slot 1 and *Photograph* is in slot 4. *Gift Card* gives +10 Mult, and *Photograph* gives x2 Mult on the first face card played. Since *Gift Card* is an independent Joker and *Photograph* is a \"when scored\" joker, the order doesn't matter (independent jokers are on the left).\n\nOkay, after thinking about it, I'm going for the Standard Pack. Buying it is my priority. This is the optimal play. I'll use the command `buy_booster 1` to execute that. I check the schema - `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`. Now that I have decided to buy the booster, it's time to confirm the action.\n\nOkay, let's buy that booster!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
