{"reasoning":"**Analysis of the Play: High Card with Face Card Spam**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 8, Round 20. Target: 100,000 chips, I'm starting at zero. I have four hands left. The current blind, Crimson Heart, is a pain; it disables a random Joker each hand. This hand, it's Hanging Chad – my retrigger king is out. Damn.\n\nMy setup is interesting. I've got Photograph, which doubles the mult on the first face card. I have Stuntman, which adds +250 chips and +20 mult (with holo and secondary). Then there's Pareidolia making all cards face cards and Sock and Buskin which retriggers all face cards. This is going to be my strategy. Spam that sweet, sweet High Card.\n\nThe core is all cards are face cards, the first is a double, all are retriggered once. Given the circumstances (1 disabled joker, 4 rounds remaining), I'm working with a High Card strategy. Let's see. My hand is a High Card (Level 9), with 85 chips and 9 mult, plus Stuntman (250 chips), giving a total of 335 chips and 29 base mult.\n\nThe critical thing is determining the *exact* order of operations. The question is how the effects stack. I know Stuntman's mult is *independent*, so it applies *after* the card triggers. I'm going to play the bonus Jack of Clubs (Pos 5). So the calculations are: base chips (85), Stuntman (250), +bonus card (40) total of 375 chips. The card scores, and Photograph triggers (X2). Sock and Buskin retriggers and Photograph triggers again (X2). My Mult is: 29 (base) * 2 (Photograph) * 2 (retrigger) = 116. Thus, 375 chips * 116 = 43,500 chips. Seems doable. 43k per hand will be enough. I need to make 100k with 4 rounds.\n\nI will play High Card, Jack of Clubs (Position 5) to maximize the chip count with Stuntman and the Photograph/Sock and Buskin combo.\n\nOne question that keeps popping up is if playing more cards is ever better? Since the build is \"face card\" focused (Pareidolia), and I am getting a Photograph trigger, plus re-triggers with Sock and Buskin, it doesn't matter. Since I'm making High Card, only one card scores for the purposes of the Photograph trigger. In other builds (Flush) more cards would be relevant, but in this setup, the singular best High Card is the strategy.\n\nLet's quickly check: Joker order: Photograph is \"on-scored\", meaning it triggers when the card scores, then Sock and Buskin retriggers. So, the X mults are good and will apply to the retriggers, so the exact Joker order is fine for this hand since Hanging Chad is disabled. But... is Stuntman actually helping, since it's an \"independent\" joker? It adds its bonus *after* the X mults... so it's not optimal. The +20 from Stuntman is added after the mult is calculated for this specific hand. It doesn't matter because it's only one card. Still, if it were additive *before*, I would have a higher score (9+20)*4.\n\nI need to confirm the exact order of operations. 1. Boss Blind. 2. On-played (DNA). 3. Played cards score (Chips, Enhancements, On-scored Jokers like Photograph, Retriggers like Sock and Buskin). 4. Held-in-hand. 5. Independent Jokers (Basic jokers, editions). So yes, this is the right order.\n\nSo, the +20 from Stuntman is applied after my *final* mult and is *not* multiplied by Photograph's X2, but rather it's added after that stage. Well, that's not ideal, but it doesn't change the strategy.\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd get the +mult before the X mult, but I'll make the best of it. One more check - my high card play last round was 85,410 - what was different? Wait! Hanging Chad! That's it! Without Chad, it's 43k, but with Chad, it triggers twice.\n\nThe plan is simple. Play a High Card with the bonus Jack and rake in some chips.\n\nSo, one last look. This is the hand.\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [5]"}
