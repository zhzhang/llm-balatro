{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy and Optimization for the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 3, Round 3, which means the Boss Blind is coming up. I have $32, which is decent, and my Joker setup is pretty solid: Gift Card (Holo, +10 Mult, and helps economy), Mail-In Rebate (Foil, +50 Chips, and helps discard), Trading Card (essential for hand thinning), Photograph (x2 Mult on first face card), and Egg (for economy). I also have Justice, but it's not relevant here in the shop.\n\nThe shop offers Misprint and Supernova. Misprint is far too inconsistent at this point, especially since I already have Gift Card and Photograph. Supernova is useless since Flush has only been played once. I'm at 5/5 Joker slots, so any buy means a sell. My focus is on maximizing scoring and economy, and my current set is good at both.\n\nMy scoring potential right now is around 5200 chips, which is safe. I'm not going to reroll - $6 is a lot when my slots are full and I need to hope for a replacement, when my existing set is decent. There's no reason to stay here in the shop. No boosters, and no vouchers to consider.\n\nThe next step is to choose the round. Before I do that, let's think about the Joker order. Photograph, Gift Card, then Mail-In Rebate is my play. Photograph is triggered when scored, Gift Card is the +10 Holo, and Mail-In Rebate is the +50 chips. \n\nSo let's break it down: cards score first, then Photograph's x2 mult is triggered, then Gift Card’s Holo bonus of +10 mult is added. The order doesn’t matter here because Photograph’s \"when scored\" is based on the moment of scoring. If I had another “when scored” +Mult Joker, then that would change.\n\nEssentially, it's (Base Mult * 2) + 10 = final mult. I have a Flush (level 4) at base 10 mult, therefore the final mult is (10 * 2) + 10 = 30 mult.\n\nI'm definitely heading to Round Select. Misprint and Supernova are irrelevant. Mail-In Rebate will help with Queens, Trading Card is for discards, and I have Justice for the round. Time to execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
