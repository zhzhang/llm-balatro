{"reasoning":"**Okay, let's break down this Balatro situation. Ante 7, facing Boss Blind next round. My High Card build is facing a significant threat – \"The Eye,\" which prevents repeat hand types. This is problematic for a pure High Card strategy. Need to score big this round. Let's think through this.**\n\nI have $67, which is decent. My current Jokers are Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. This setup is *built* for High Card: Pareidolia turns everything into face cards. Stuntman gives a massive chip bonus. Hanging Chad retriggers the first card twice. Photograph is critical for the X2 on the first face card, which Smiley Face also enhances with +5 mult per face card. The Holo Stuntman gives +10 mult on its own.\n\nMy immediate concern is \"The Eye.\" I need a monster High Card play or a pivot. I also have the Director's Cut voucher – a reroll on the Boss Blind – thank goodness! Let's calculate: I need 100k or more.\n\nLet's do the math on a single High Card: 35 base chips, 4 base mult. Stuntman adds 250 chips and 10 mult. Let's say I lead with an Ace (Pareidolia). It will score three times due to Hanging Chad. Each trigger gets +5 mult (Smiley). The *first* trigger gets X2 mult (Photograph). That could be (35+250+11) \\* ((4+15)\\*8+10) = 47,952. Still not 100k.\n\nMy recent scores averaged around 70k, so 100k+ is the target. Need to adjust. I *must* reroll \"The Eye.\"\n\nI have a good amount of money, so rerolling the shop is the way to go right now. I have no urgent need to buy anything, especially considering my current strategy. I can definitely reroll.\n\nLet's verify the joker order:\n1.  Smiley Face (+5 mult for face)\n2.  Photograph (x2 first face)\n3.  Hanging Chad (re-triggers the first card twice)\n4.  Stuntman (+250 chips, +10 mult holo)\n5.  Pareidolia (all cards are face)\n\nThe order of Smiley Face before Photograph is intentional, to ensure the +Mult happens before the xMult is calculated. Photograph triggers *on scoring* (not independently).\n\nNow, let's look at the Jokers again, especially for potential synergies and/or replacements. The Joker slots are full. The shop cards are useless, which means I will be **rerolling the shop**.\n\nMail-In Rebate is interesting, however, as it refunds $5 per discarded Queen. Pareidolia makes all cards Queens... or does it? No, Pareidolia only *considers* cards as face cards, so the rebate would not apply. Still, I should try to prioritize looking for a Pluto (Celestial Pack) to improve my High Card level.\n\n**Now, the plan is to reroll the shop.** I can reroll more than once if necessary. Director's Cut will reroll the Boss blind. I have no reason to sell anything right now and should preserve my core setup.\n\nChecking the shop one last time. Still rerolling.\n\nSo, one last review of the vouchers: Telescope is active. I really want a Celestial Pack!\n\nFinal action: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
