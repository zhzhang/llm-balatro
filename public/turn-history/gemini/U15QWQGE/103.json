{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Round 9, High Card Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Round 9, ante 5/8, and I've got $58. The plan remains the same: a High Card build, leaning heavily on the \"Everything is a Face Card\" (Pareidolia) strategy, amplified by face card synergy. I've got my core Jokers locked in: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. Justice is my only consumable, and I'm holding Overstock and Overstock Plus vouchers.\n\nCurrently, Flush is Level 5, and High Card is Level 1, which is what I am focused on now.\n\nI've got a couple of irrelevant Jokers cluttering the screen (Uranus, Clever Joker, Shoot the Moon, Mystic Summit) which would be great if I was focused on Two Pair or Discards.\n\nThe critical path here is to optimize the High Card build I've established. Let's break down the joker order and how they'll work together:\n\nI need to make sure the played cards are scored correctly. The played cards score left to right. Smiley Face and Photograph are *on scored* Jokers. Hanging Chad will retrigger the first card. I will be working with the current order: Smiley Face (1), then Photograph (2), then Hanging Chad (3). Stuntman (4) is independent. Pareidolia (5) applies.\n\nHanging Chad's retriggering is the key. Smiley Face will add +5 Mult *when scored*. Photograph doubles the Mult *when scored* for the first face card. Since Pareidolia is active, the first card *is* a face card. So here is the plan:\n\nIf the first card scores:\n1.  Base Mult (e.g., 1 for High Card).\n2.  Smiley Face (+5).\n3.  Photograph (x2).\n4.  Hanging Chad retriggers steps 1-3 twice.\n5.  Stuntman (Independent Joker) adds +10 Mult at the end.\n\nThe calculation for Level 1 High Card (Base Mult 1) will be:\n\n*   Trigger 1: (1 + 5) \\* 2 = 12.\n*   Trigger 2: (12 + 5) \\* 2 = 34.\n*   Trigger 3: (34 + 5) \\* 2 = 78.\n*   End of scoring: 78 + 10 (Stuntman) = 88 Mult.\n*   Chips: (5 + Rank + 250) \\* 88.\n\nI need to make sure I am getting the highest scoring. I need to make sure that (Smiley Face, then Photograph) is the right order: If Smiley Face (1) is before Photograph (2): (Mult + 5) \\* 2. If Photograph (1) is before Smiley Face (2): (Mult \\* 2) + 5. (1+5)\\*2 = 12 is better than (1\\*2)+5 = 7. So current order (Smiley Face, then Photograph) is correct. I have it optimized.\n\nInventory space is, of course, full for Jokers. I do have one open consumable slot, which is good.\n\nI need to make the best use of my money now, and to achieve my objectives. I need to check the Arcana Pack for scaling options. I need to look for Tarot cards like Hanged Man to thin the deck, Strength, or a Soul/Legendary would be amazing, or simply more money/vouchers.\n\nGiven the boss risk, and I can afford it, the Director's Cut ($10) is a good pickup. \"The Mark\" (debuff face cards) would be devastating.\n\nSo, let's start with the Arcana Pack. I will `buy_booster` at position 1 (Arcana Pack).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
