{"reasoning":"**A Balatro Brainstorm: The Goad and Beyond**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. I'm in Ante 3, Round 5, Shop phase. The target is \"The Goad\" Boss Blind with 6,600 chips to beat, but Spades are debuffed. I've got $49 to work with. Let's break down the assets:\n\n*   **Jokers**:\n    1.  Gift Card (Holo): +10 Mult, good for sell value too.\n    2.  Mail-In Rebate (Foil): +50 Chips and income from discarding 8s.\n    3.  Trading Card: Destroys a card for $3 on first discard, handy for deck thinning.\n    4.  Photograph: Core of the engine. X2 Mult on the first played face card.\n    5.  Hanging Chad: Retriggers the first played card 2 times.\n\n*   **Consumables**: Justice (Glass Card), not relevant here.\n\n*   **The Shop**:\n    1.  Blue Joker: +102 chips.\n    2.  Even Steven: +4 Mult for even-ranked cards.\n    3.  Hallucination: Tarot chance from booster.\n\nNo boosters or vouchers left. The core strategy is **Photograph + Hanging Chad**, creating an X8 multiplier on the first face card. Gift Card adds a flat +10 Mult, and Mail-In Rebate contributes chips and income.\n\nNow, considering the shop, **Blue Joker** looks tempting, but it means selling one of my current Jokers. Selling Mail-In Rebate for a net gain of +52 chips but losing income isn't great. Trading Card is great for deck thinning, so no. Gift Card's +10 Mult is too strong to sell. So, I'll pass on Blue Joker. **Even Steven**'s +4 Mult doesn't stack up to Photograph and Chad. **Hallucination** is useless without boosters.\n\nWith $49, I could buy Blue Joker for $5 and be left with $44, but the interest caps at $25 ($5 interest). The Gift Card increases sell value, though, so selling Mail-In Rebate or Trading Card is the way. But with Photograph/Hanging Chad, I likely don't need the extra +102 chips. Let's do the math to make sure:\n\n*   A base hand like a Pair of Jacks will get me 80 chips. With (2 * 8) + 10 = 26 mult, that's only 2,080.\n*   But a Flush is 10 Mult: (10 * 8) + 10 = 90. 130 * 90 = 11,700!\n\nSo, I can easily beat the target without Blue Joker.\n\nRerolling is an option, but the current shop doesn't offer much. I could try to fish for better chip or mult Jokers to eventually replace Gift Card, or income, but I'll save money for now. The Goad debuffs Spades, so I need to play non-spade face cards first.\n\nThere's nothing to buy in this shop. I'll save my money for the next shop to stay above interest, so I can buy boosters.\n\nOkay, let's make sure the Joker order is correct. Hanging Chad retriggers the *first* played card. Photograph retriggers the *first* played *face* card. If the first card is a non-spade face card:\n1.  Card scores.\n2.  Photograph (X2).\n3.  Chad Retrigger 1 -> Photograph (X2).\n4.  Chad Retrigger 2 -> Photograph (X2).\n5.  Gift Card (+10 Mult).\n\nSince they are \"on scoring\" effects, the Joker order (1-5) doesn't affect Photograph/Chad because they trigger at different steps. The \"+10 Mult\" is added in the \"Independent\" phase. The +10 Mult is from the Holo edition of Gift Card, which is added *after* the multipliers. The order of the Jokers themselves (1-5) won't change this because Photograph is not a static Mult Joker, but a triggered effect on the card.\n\nSo, here's the Balatro scoring order:\n1.  Played cards score. (This is where Photograph/Chad happen).\n2.  Held-in-hand.\n3.  Independent Jokers activate.\n\nPhotograph's triggered effect happens during step 3. Gift Card's effect is Step 5. That means the X2s\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
