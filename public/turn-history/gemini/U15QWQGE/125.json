{"reasoning":"**Shop Analysis & Reroll Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5/8, Round 11, and I'm in the SHOP phase with $40. Current build is a High Card (Level 2) strategy, working off a solid engine: Smiley Face (+5 mult per face card), Photograph (x2 mult on the first face card), Hanging Chad (re-triggers the first card 2 times), Stuntman (Holo, +10 mult, +250 chips), and Pareidolia (all cards are face cards). I’m getting pretty decent scores, generally in the 36k-60k range per hand, but the boss blind is coming up, and I want to optimize further.\n\nI have Justice available, a glass card enhancement, but it's useless for me right now. I have to be holding a card to use the consumable. I can't activate anything here in the shop.\n\nLooking at the current shop offerings: *Card Sharp* (x3 mult if hand already played this round), *Shoot the Moon* (+13 mult per Queen held), *The Moon* (up to 3 cards to Clubs), and *Abstract Joker* (+3 mult per Joker, for a total of +15 mult). No boosters or vouchers are available.\n\nLet's break these down:\n\n*   **Card Sharp:** This might look appealing, but it's a trap. My current setup gives 96 Mult per round.  Even if I were to replace Smiley Face with it, on the *second* hand (the only time it *might* be useful), it'd only be worth 78 Mult (26 on the first hand times 3 on the second hand). It's worse than my current engine.\n*   **Shoot the Moon:** Doesn't fit with my High Card strategy. I'm not focusing on Queens. Plus, with my current Jokers, all cards are face cards, making this less useful.\n*   **The Moon:** Not important since I'm not focusing on suits.\n*   **Abstract Joker:** Doesn't give enough mult to be worth it.\n\nI have $40, so rerolling the shop for $5 is within budget and makes sense. My goal is to find better multipliers (The Duo, The Trio, etc.), Blueprint or Brainstorm, to copy Hanging Chad or Photograph. A Burnt Joker would be great to level up High Card. Space Joker has a chance to level up a hand. Pluto is a planet card to use with High Card. Vouchers like Telescope or better interest are also helpful.\n\nI double-checked the math for the jokers. The placement is correct for Smiley (+5) triggering before Photograph (x2), which maximizes the benefit of the re-triggers from Hanging Chad, which would trigger 3 times on the *same* card.\n\nThere's nothing else worth buying, so I'm rerolling the shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
