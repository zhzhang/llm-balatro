{"reasoning":"**A High-Stakes Calculation**\n\nOkay, here we go. Final boss, Ante 8, blind: Crimson Heart – that's one Joker gone every hand, brilliant. The goal is 100,000 chips; I'm at 83,349 – I need 16,651 more to win, and I've only got one hand left. This is crunch time. The deck has 42 cards left. I also have 3 discards.\n\nLet's break down what I have. I've got my Jokers: Photograph (X2 Mult on the first face card), Stuntman (+250 chips, +10 Mult), Pareidolia (all cards are face cards), and Sock and Buskin (retriggers face cards). Hanging Chad, unfortunately, is disabled. My hand consists of: Jack of Hearts (+10 chips), 6 of Hearts (+6 chips), Ace of Clubs (+11 chips), 8 of Clubs (+8 chips), 2 of Clubs (+2 chips), and Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips).\n\nFirst thought: High Card Level 9. Base is 85 chips, 9 Mult. Since all cards are face cards, and photograph triggers on the first face card, so that would double the Mult. And, because of Sock and Buskin, the face card would trigger twice! So, my chips will be 85 + 11 + 11 + 250 (Stuntman) = 357. My Mult will be 9 + 10 = 19; then Photograph would double that to 38, and finally, double that to 76! So, 357 * 46 = 16,422. But, I need 16,651. Crap, I'm short!\n\nWhat about playing more than one card? If I go for a pair of Aces, that's Pair Level 3. That's 40 chips and 4 Mult. The sequence would go: 40 + 11 = 51, and then Sock and Buskin = 62. Then I have the same sequence. That's no good.\n\nOkay, Flush. Flush Level 5 has 95 chips, 12 Mult. Let's see...I could get a flush. I have 3 Clubs, 2 Hearts. I can discard the non-clubs to attempt a flush. If I make a flush, the first card would trigger everything, then the retrigger. Let's say: 95 chips, plus all other cards = 415. The mult 58 (12 + 10 mult) = 24,070. I can win if I can do that.\n\nSo, the play is: Discard to try to flush. OR: go for the Red Seal or Bonus cards. If I can discard enough, I could use \"The World\" consumable for a flush. Otherwise, play the Red Seal High Card. If I can discard enough, then I can make a flush. That's my best chance here. I still have the option to make the High Card, so I still have an \"out\" if I can't find anything.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
