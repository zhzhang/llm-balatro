{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop State**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4, Round 6, I'm in the SHOP phase, with $65, and my Joker slots are maxed out, currently holding Gift Card (Holo, +10 Mult, Scaling Sell Value), Trading Card, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman. I also have Justice in my consumable slot. I've got Overstock voucher.\n\nMy strategy revolves around the synergy between Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman. Photograph triples the multiplier on the first face card, and with Hanging Chad, that effect triggers three times. Stuntman is my primary chip generator. Gift Card provides that flat mult. Trading Card will help me thin the deck and provide some money.\n\nThe shop offers Oops! All 6s, which isn't particularly relevant right now. The Zany Joker, which needs a 3-of-a-kind, isn't worth considering. The Standard Pack might be useful *if* it gives me a good face card or an Ace, but I'm also deck thinning with Trading Card so adding more cards is risky. Overstock Plus for $10 is an obvious buy; more shop slots are a long-term benefit.\n\nI have $65. Overstock Plus costs $10. Buying it is a no-brainer. But first, the Standard Pack: it might give me a good card to combine with my existing strategy.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the scoring order. The key is to understand how Photograph and Gift Card interact. My current Joker order is Gift Card, Trading Card, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman. Independent Jokers activate before card scoring, and dependent jokers during. So, the order needs to be such that Gift Card adds to the card mult *before* the Photograph triggers.\n\nMy focus is on maximizing Photograph's multiplier. Since it triggers *during* the card scoring phase, the flat mult from Gift Card applies to the resulting mult. If I play the King and its the first face card:\n- King scores: Base Chips + Stuntman (250).\n- Photograph triggers (X2 Mult).\n- Retrigger (Hanging Chad) -> Base Chips + Stuntman (250).\n- Photograph triggers (X2 Mult).\n- Retrigger (Hanging Chad) -> Base Chips + Stuntman (250).\n- Photograph triggers (X2 Mult).\n- Gift Card: +10 mult is added at the end.\n\nThe Gift Card's position doesn't matter *too* much relative to Photograph/Chad since Photograph is dependent, but generally +Mult goes earlier in the Joker order.\n\nI had the Justice card which enhances one card to be Glass. I was considering using it to enhance a face card, but I can't do that now; Justice is a Tarot card that \"Selects\" so it cannot be used in a SHOP step.\n\nSo, the plan: First, I should buy Overstock Plus. It's a permanent upgrade, and it doesn't even hurt my interest income. I'm earning $5 interest either way. Buying it first before potentially the Standard Pack makes the most sense.\n\nI'm thinking to buy the Overstock Plus and maybe the Standard Pack.\n\nFinal decision: I'll buy Overstock Plus. Then, *maybe* I'll take the Standard Pack.\n\nAction: `buy_voucher 1` (Overstock Plus)\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
