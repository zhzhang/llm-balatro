{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis for Boss Blind: The Eye**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for facing \"The Eye,\" keeping the no-repeat hand requirement in mind. I'm at 7/8 Ante, Round 16, and have $39. My primary goal is to optimize for this boss fight and maintain flexibility. My current inventory consists of: Smiley Face (Joker 1), Photograph (Joker 2), Hanging Chad (Joker 3), Stuntman (Joker 4), and Pareidolia (Joker 5), and the consumable \"The World\". My vouchers are Telescope and Director's Cut.\n\nThe main challenge is the hand type restriction. I need to win using different hand types. I've been relying heavily on High Card (currently Level 4, played 8 times), but I have Pair (Level 3) and Flush (Level 5) as backup options. My shop options are Pluto (Planet, 1), The Star (2), Scary Face (3), and To Do List (4).\n\nMy immediate priority is upgrading High Card. Pluto is the perfect tool for this, as it costs $3, and will get it to Level 5. The Star is not needed at this time. Scary Face (+30 chips for face cards) is tempting, but with Stuntman, that chip gain is not worth selling a multiplier or any component of the engine. To Do List (economy) is not worth a Joker slot.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient move is to buy and use Pluto. I'll use the `buy_and_use_consumable` command with position 1 to get Pluto, immediately boosting High Card. I understand the syntax and purpose of `buy_and_use_consumable`. I can use it on position 1 to get the card and then immediately use the card.\n\nAfter the purchase, I'll have $36. I have the Telescope voucher, so there's a good chance I will get Pluto in every celestial pack. Rerolling to find more Pluto cards or packs is worth considering. I won't re-roll now.\n\nI've also confirmed my Joker ordering: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. This arrangement maximizes the multiplier and retriggering effects. Hanging Chad will retrigger \"on scored\" effects of Jokers, including Photograph.\n\nLet's do a quick calculation. Let's see if Scary Face is worth it. 30/250 = 12% increase. That is not worth the multiplier or engine components.\n\nFinally, a quick review of my strategy for \"The Eye.\" Leveling High Card to level 5 will allow me to use it once. I also have to make sure my \"Pair\" or \"Two Pair\" or \"Flush\" can score enough. Flush is level 5. This is good.\n\nI am using Pluto. My final decision is to execute `buy_and_use_consumable 1` to buy and immediately use Pluto, leveling up High Card. This is the optimal action to prepare for \"The Eye.\"\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
