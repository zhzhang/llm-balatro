{"reasoning":"**Shop Decisions: A High-Wire Act**\n\nAlright, here's the deal. Ante 8, a solid High Card build, and a wallet overflowing with $42. My Jokers are clicking: Hanging Chad, Photograph, Sock and Buskin, Pareidolia, and Stuntman. We're talking 200k+ High Cards, but the Crimson Heart boss is a threat. That one random Joker disable could gut the whole operation. My gut says reroll that boss, but let's be strategic.\n\nFirst things first: the shop. The initial Jokers aren't worth swapping out. Satellite is tempting for money down the line but not necessary right now. Chaos the Clown could be good for rerolls, but I'm flush with money and the Jokers are synergistic. Reserved Parking with Pareidolia is good money, but Joker slots are full. The Lovers are also no use. Tarot Merchant is a long-term play, not now. So the only real option is Standard Packs.\n\nThe key is to shore up the weaknesses. If Crimson Heart hits Pareidolia, the whole thing falls apart (no face cards, no big scores). If Photograph goes, the multiplier is gone. If Stuntman gets sniped, it's a huge chip and mult drop. The only safe one is maybe Sock and Buskin, though that would also hurt. So my top priority is mitigating that boss's effect.\n\nBut the real power of my build is the multiplier from Photograph. So Stuntman can trigger *after* photograph. The core is the engine: Chad, Photograph, Sock and Buskin, and then Stuntman to enhance the score.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, do I buy Standard Packs? Or do I buy Tarot Merchant to improve future shops? The goal is to survive, win, and get more money, so let's start with the booster packs. But wait, since I've got The World, I can consider my options.\n\nI'm thinking of my \"Director's Cut\" voucher. This allows me to reroll a boss, and that Crimson Heart is scary. The Big Blind is manageable (75k), but the Boss Blind is 100k, and it's the real threat. The question is: do I reroll *before* or *after* the Big Blind? The Boss Reroll cost is $10. I have $42. I *can* afford to reroll the boss, I just need to decide when.\n\nNow, let's look at the numbers. Let's see what happens if I buy Standard Packs first, and then decide on the boss. I'm going to buy the Standard Packs, and then reroll the boss. That's the plan.\n\nAnd, if all goes well, buy another Standard Pack. The numbers have to be right, I'm going to run the calculations so that I can decide.\n\nAlright, Standard Pack 1 is in the bag.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
