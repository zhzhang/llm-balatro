{"reasoning":"**Planet Pack Decision: Prioritizing High Card**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. It's Round 11, the Planet Pack step, and I'm looking at the Mega Celestial Pack. Ante is 5/8, and I have $29 to work with. My Joker lineup is solid: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), and Pareidolia. Justice is my only consumable. The clear strategy here is to maximize my High Card build.\n\nThe pack offers Pluto (High Card), Jupiter (Flush), Mercury (Pair), Neptune (Straight Flush), and Saturn (Straight). High Card is currently Level 1, with a base of 5 Chips and 1 Mult. The build is centered around that. Stuntman is my powerhouse, giving me +250 Chips and +10 Mult. Pareidolia is great; it makes all cards face cards. Then I have Smiley Face (+5 Mult) and Photograph (X2 Mult), both of which trigger on the played card, plus Hanging Chad, which retriggers it twice.\n\nPluto is the key here. It adds +10 Chips and +1 Mult to High Card, and is the primary scaling mechanism. So, clearly, I *have* to pick Pluto first. The other choices are less relevant. Jupiter is a Level 5 Flush, but I'm not playing Flushes. Mercury is a Level 2 Pair, also irrelevant. Neptune and Saturn are for Straight Flush and Straight, which are also not relevant for me.\n\nSince this is a Mega Celestial Pack, I have to pick two cards.\n\nMy plan is simple:\n\n1.  Select Pluto.\n2.  Then, I'll assess the best second choice, maybe Jupiter for the sell value, or Mercury to clear the pack.\n\nSo, the action is `select` and the position is `1` for Pluto. The `intended_hand_type` is null as it's a planet choice, but I'm thinking High Card. The `estimated_chips` is null too because I'm not playing a hand here.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
