{"reasoning":"**Current Plan: Buy the Spectral Pack**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in the Shop phase of Balatro, Ante 3/8, Round 4. Got $53 burning a hole in my pocket. I've got a killer combo cooking: Photograph (that sweet x2 multiplier on the first face card) and Hanging Chad (retriggers the first played card twice). That means, if I lead with a face card, it's gonna score like crazy with that +10 mult Gift Card. I've crunched the numbers, and the multiplier is something like x8 plus 10 mult, which should be plenty to win.\n\nI need to get out of the shop. I need to make a decision. I've got a Spectral Pack in the shop for $4. Spectral Packs are usually a good value, plus that's affordable. I have 5 Jokers already, maxed out. I'll open it.\n\nThe joker positioning isn't critical right now because Photograph is \"when scored\" (Step 3) and Gift Card is a flat +10 Mult, meaning its edition triggers in Step 5. I don't see any other reason to change the order. Photograph/Chad is the win condition.\n\nThe best move is to buy the Spectral Pack.\n\nAction: `buy_booster`, positions: [1].\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
