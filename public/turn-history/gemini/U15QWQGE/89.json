{"reasoning":"**The Shop: A Symphony of Optimization**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 4, Round 7. Time to see what the shop has to offer. I've got $47, a pretty solid foundation. My Joker setup is where the real power lies, though. Let's see... Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. This is a *beautiful* engine. Pareidolia means every card's a face card, Smiley Face adds +5 Mult for each, Photograph doubles the first face card, and Hanging Chad retriggers it *twice*. Each card will trigger the smiley, then photo, then chad, then again, then again, resulting in 8x on each card. It's like a machine! I've also got Stuntman giving me a nice chip boost, which is keeping me afloat.\n\nI'm eyeing the shop cards, but nothing seems better than what I have. Acrobat is tempting, but X3 on the final hand isn't going to be better than what I have now, where it's mult on *every* hand. I am *very* reluctant to sell any of my jokers, since the current synergy is just too strong. Stuntman is the only one I'm even *slightly* considering, but +250 chips are crucial for me at this point. No need for the Tower, and Superposition isn't even worth it. The Overstock and Overstock Plus vouchers are good, but I don't really need them right now.\n\nI've already re-arranged my Jokers (thanks to the last action) to ensure the triggers fire in the correct order, Smiley, Photo, Chad. So, I have: Smiley, Photo, Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia.\n\nI have Justice (Glass) and The World (Spades) consumables, which are good. I can't use them here, though. That will have to wait for the round. The question is, should I use them? I'll hold onto them for now. I should save my money and proceed to the round selection.\n\nShould I reroll? I could look for planets or a better Joker, but my money is better saved for interest and future higher-cost items.\n\nI think I'm set. Let's make sure that's true by looking at the shop one last time. Nope. Looks like I'll save the money and proceed.\n\nOne last thing, since I'm leaving, should I use Justice or The World? I'll have to see when the blind is coming. No, I should hold them.\n\nFinal decision: `round_select`. Let's get to the next round!\n\nOh wait, one thing: the hand size from Stuntman is reduced. It makes things a little harder. Justice is a little risky since cards can break. The World is nice since it'll allow for the Flushes. Let's proceed.\n\nOkay, now *really* time to move on.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
