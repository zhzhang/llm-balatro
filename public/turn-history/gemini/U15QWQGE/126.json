{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Refining the High Card Engine**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 5, Round 11. I'm sitting on $40 with a solid High Card engine brewing, thanks to the power of Pareidolia, Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman. My goal is to maximize the single-card play. This is working very well.\n\nThe current shop? Meh. `Shoot the Moon` is useless since Pareidolia doesn't *specifically* make cards Queens. `Oops! All 6s` has no synergy. `Ceremonial Dagger` is a non-starter. `Saturn` doesn't help my High Card strategy.\n\nI have more than enough money to keep rerolling, so the interest cap is not a concern, given I am above that threshold. I need to find something better. Specifically, I'm hoping for Pluto, Blueprint, Brainstorm, or some stronger multipliers, so it's *reroll_shop* time. There's not much need for my `Justice` consumable currently, but I'll hold onto it for now, just in case a better consumable like Pluto shows up.\n\nWait, before I reroll, I'll double-check my joker setup. It's: Smiley, Photograph, Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. This order is correct; the `Photograph` needs to be after `Smiley` for the multiplier to apply correctly, as it is an \"on score\" joker. \n\nOkay, I'm mentally clear now. I can easily afford another reroll.\n\nI've already checked for vouchers and boosters. There is nothing else to buy. The only smart thing to do at this point is to **reroll the shop again**.\n\nBefore I do, let me analyze the shop. (1) `Shoot the Moon`. (2) `Oops! All 6s`. (3) `Ceremonial Dagger`. (4) `Saturn`. Nope. Nothing to see here. Time to *reroll_shop* one more time. The interest will not be affected at this point.\n\nRerolling to find the best improvements for my build will continue to improve my chances, especially given the upcoming boss. With the Director's Cut voucher, I should have enough money to reroll if the next boss is not ideal. This is a very strong build.\n\nI have 5 Jokers. My only option for adding any more Jokers is to sell one of my current ones. No other options are available in this shop.\n\nLet's **reroll the shop** one more time to optimize the engine.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
