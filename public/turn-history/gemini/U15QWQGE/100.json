{"reasoning":"**The Game Plan: Secure Victory**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 4, Round 9, facing \"The Psychic\" boss. The objective? Reach 10,000 chips. With my Jokers, I'm confident I can crush this. The current hand is: King of Hearts, Jack of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds, 7 of Diamonds, 4 of Diamonds. Hand size is 6, but Stuntman means I can only play 5. I have Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia in my Joker lineup. Pareidolia makes all cards face cards, which is perfect for Smiley Face and Photograph. Stuntman gives a nice chip and multiplier boost.\n\nAfter evaluating the hand, I have to make sure I am keeping one card. While the previous reasoning said to expect a \"Blue Seal 10 of Diamonds\" (Planet Card), I don't see one. But that doesn't matter too much; I need to play 5 cards.\n\nNow, let's analyze the multipliers. Photograph doubles the first face card's multiplier, Smiley Face adds +5 to *every* face card played, and Hanging Chad retriggers the first card. I've re-read the scoring order to make sure I understand it. Boss effects happen first, then 'on played' Jokers, then the played cards score (left to right), and the scoring triggers, finally independent Jokers.\n\nMy initial thought was to play a High Card, but with Pareidolia, everything's a face card! The base hand is High Card, giving 5 Chips and 1 Mult. But the key is to maximize the Joker synergy. Hanging Chad is powerful. If I play the King of Hearts as my first card, it will be re-triggered twice, giving a huge multiplier. With Smiley Face, each face card will add 5 Mult and with Photograph, the King gets doubled for a total multiplier of 24, on each of the three re-triggers. The other cards score on their own. And Stuntman is the icing on the cake.\n\nAfter calculating, I get a score of about 30,780. Well over the 10,000 I need. I did verify that my Jokers are in the most optimal order.\n\nAfter a deeper dive, I realized I can use Justice to make the King a Glass card for even more multipliers. However, after considering that I don't *need* the extra multiplier, I'll pass on it. No reason to take the risk. I am going to make a 'High Card' hand (cards 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nWait, the card scoring is different! Only cards *participating* in the hand score. Since I have a High Card, only the King's chip values score. Smiley Face only applies to the highest card, meaning the rest of the cards do nothing, besides give a flat +5 Mult (or 10 in Stuntman). It looks like the cards in the hand are all face cards. This means 5, 2x and 3x on the King.\n\nAfter a few recalculations, playing the hand is still the best move, and will achieve 23,320, well over 10,000. No risk. And all I have to do to win is play 5 cards.\nI'm just going to play the hand!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
