{"reasoning":"**Deep Dive: Pack Selection Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4/8, Round 8. Standard pack, two picks. First pick was the Red Seal Queen of Hearts – excellent, especially with my current Joker setup (Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia). The Red Seal on the first card is a huge boon for that Photograph/Chad/Smiley Face combo. I've got $51, and two consumables: Justice and The World.\n\nNow for my second pick. The options are: the 10 of Diamonds (Blue Seal), the Ace of Clubs (Foil), 3 of Hearts, and the 9 of Hearts (Lucky Card).\n\nThe 10 of Diamonds is the clear winner here. That Blue Seal is critical. At the end of the round, if held, it'll create a Planet card for my final hand, which is usually a high card or a flush, so it will scale incredibly well into the next rounds. The Ace of Clubs provides +50 chips, but that's not as impactful with Stuntman. The 9 of Hearts is okay, but not as good as the Blue Seal for long-term scaling.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I have space for the planet card! I have a full consumable inventory. I'll need an empty consumable slot at the *end* of the round to receive the Planet card. It's safe to select the card now, though. I can sell or use a consumable later.\n\nI'm comparing the 10 of Diamonds (Blue Seal) to the Ace of Clubs (Foil). The Blue Seal is significantly better. It's rank 10, the Queen was rank 12, but Pareidolia makes them both face cards anyway.\n\nOkay, select the 10 of Diamonds. Position 1.\n\nNo reason to skip this selection. No need to use or sell a consumable right now. I'm happy with my current Joker order; it prioritizes additive Mult from Smiley Face before multiplicative Mult from Photograph. Just double checking my scoring logic, here: played cards score left to right, with each card doing the following: base chips -> card modifiers -> on score jokers -> retriggers, and all that repeats for the retrigger. My retrigger Joker is the Hanging Chad and it works as expected.\n\nI am selecting the 10 of Diamonds (Blue Seal). That's my final action: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`. That card is definitely the 10 of Diamonds, which *does* create a Planet card at the end of the round, confirming the plan. Checking the 9 of Hearts, just to be sure... it has no seal. It's a no-brainer. This is the optimal play. `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`. That's the correct move!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
