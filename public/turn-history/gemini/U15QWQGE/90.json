{"reasoning":"**Current Round Assessment**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante is at 4/8, Round 7. I'm in the Blind Select phase, facing the Big Blind, which needs 7,500 chips. The next hurdle is the Boss Blind, The Psychic, demanding I play five cards for 10,000 chips. Got to think about what to do here.\n\nInventory is looking solid, I've got a killer Joker lineup: Pareidolia, Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman, all of which synergize perfectly. Pareidolia makes *every* card a face card, Smiley Face adds +5 Mult for *each* scored card because of it, Photograph doubles the mult for the first played card, Hanging Chad retriggers that *first* card twice, and Stuntman throws in a cool 250 flat chips. I've also got Justice and The World in consumables, but they're not usable now. Current money is $47. My hand levels are decent, Flush at Level 4, Full House at 2, and Four of a Kind at 2. There's also an Orbital Tag reward offering a 3-level upgrade to a random hand.\n\nLet's do some math: With Pareidolia, Smiley Face, Photograph, and Hanging Chad, I can get a really high score. A simple High Card (Rank 10) gives:\n- 5 (Base Chips) + 10 (Rank) + 250 (Stuntman) = 265 chips.\n- 1 (Base Mult)\n- Trigger 1 (First Card): Smiley Face = 6 mult, Photograph = 12 mult.\n- Trigger 2 (Hanging Chad 1st retrigger): Smiley Face = 17 mult, Photograph = 34 mult.\n- Trigger 3 (Hanging Chad 2nd retrigger): Smiley Face = 39 mult, Photograph = 78 mult.\n- Total Score: 265 * 78 = 20,670 chips.\n\nOne High Card is enough to clear both blinds!\n\nSo, the Orbital Tag... worth skipping for? Playing gives me $4 + Interest ($5) = $9 total, plus a shop. But that tag is random. If it hits something good like \"High Card\" or \"Pair\", it's ok, but \"Flush Five\" would be useless here. Besides, I'm already close to the $50 cap for interest. I generally value shopping more than skipping unless that tag is something truly game-changing. This build is already winning easily.\n\nMy options are clear: I can play the round, skip the round, or use a consumable. Right now, I can't use Justice or The World, it's not the right time. Jokers are already optimally placed - Smiley Face before Photograph.\n\nThe best course of action is to play the round. The Joker synergy is massive. A single played card will easily hit the target score to get to the Boss Blind. Playing this round is definitely better than skipping, since it provides access to the shop and money.\n\n**Action: `play_round`.**\n\n**Target: Big Blind.**\n\n**Reasoning: The build is optimized. This Joker setup is the winning formula.**\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
