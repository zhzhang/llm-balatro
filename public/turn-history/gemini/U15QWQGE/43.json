{"reasoning":"**Strategic Poker Thoughts - Round 4**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante is 3/8, small blind. Goal is 2000 chips. I'm currently at 0, with $35 in the bank. I have 4 hands, 3 discards. Got a few Jokers to play with: Gift Card (Holo, +10 mult, +$1 sell), Mail-In Rebate (Foil, +50 chips, +$5 for Queens), Trading Card (used already this round), Photograph (x2 mult on face card), and an Egg (+3 sell). Consumable: Justice (enhances to Glass). My current hand is: 7H, 6H, JC, 4C, 3C, AD, 8D, 3D.\n\nOkay, I used the Trading Card already this round. With the initial discard, I’m left with $35. Now, the goal is 2000 chips. Let's see... my current hand options are limited. No immediate Flushes or Full Houses. \n\nI’ve got 2 Hearts (7H, 6H), 3 Clubs (JC, 4C, 3C), and 3 Diamonds (AD, 8D, 3D). I see I'm holding 10 of Spades, 9 of Diamonds, 16 of Hearts, and 7 of Clubs. Hearts are the most prevalent in the deck - interesting.\n\nI need to decide what to discard. Given the discards, I really should go for the Hearts, since that's what's most common in the deck, but I'm looking at how to make my hand higher scoring. I want to build a flush. The Mail-In Rebate is enticing for Queens, but I don't have any. The Photograph, for a Face card, is good, but I can improve that card. The Justice card could make an Ace or Face card Glass. Since my hand has an Ace of Diamonds and a Jack of Clubs.\n\nSince the goal is 2000 chips, and I have 4 hands with 3 discards... if I discard the Diamonds and Clubs, I'll have a chance to look for Hearts. I need a plan here!\n\nRight, I can only discard 5 cards at a time. The current suits are Hearts (2), Clubs (3), Diamonds (3). The strategy, go for a Heart Flush. I am keeping the 2 Hearts.\n\nSo, discarding 3, 4, 5 Clubs and 7, 8 Diamonds. Wait, the actual hand given is: 7H, 6H, JC, 4C, 3C, AD, 8D, 3D. I should discard the 3 Diamonds (AD, 8D, 3D) and 2 Clubs (4C, 3C). \n\nOkay, I'm going to discard 4C, 3C, AD, 8D, 3D. That's 5 cards. Keep 7H, 6H, JC. The Mail-In Rebate could get me $5 for each discarded Queen, and I don't have any, which is okay.\n\nThe plan: A Lvl 4 Flush (80 chips, 10 mult) is the best bet. My Jokers are Mail-In Rebate (+50), Gift Card (+10 mult), and Photograph (x2 mult on a face card). If I get a face card with a Flush: (80 + 50) * (10 * 2 + 10) or ~4200 chips, which easily surpasses the goal of 2000. So I have to find a face card, or ideally 5 Hearts.\n\nMy current Hearts: 2 (7H, 6H), Clubs: 3 (JC, 4C, 3C), Diamonds: 3 (AD, 8D, 3D). Hearts in the deck are the highest chance. I will discard those 5: 4C, 3C, AD, 8D, 3D. This keeps JC, 7H, 6H.\n\nShould I use Justice now? Glass cards provide x2 mult. If I use it on the JC: Mult = (Base * 2 * 2) + 10. The aim is only 2000, and I will likely already be good enough. Glass cards can break! Better to save the consumable for a harder round.\n\nLet's double-check the Joker order. Step 5 says that I should have the +Chips before xMult, and +Mult before xMult. Right, the Jokers, Gift Card (+\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
