{"reasoning":"**Shopping Strategy: High Card Build**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 6, round 14, and $40 in the bank. I'm running a pretty solid High Card build, focused on maximizing face card bonuses. Pareidolia is key, turning everything into face cards, which triggers Smiley Face for +5 Mult, Hanging Chad for re-triggering the first card, and Photograph for x2 Mult on the initial face card. Stuntman (Holo) gives a big chip and mult boost, but reduces hand size - something I'm managing. High Card is currently level 3, which is decent.\n\nLooking at the shop, Pluto at $3 is an absolute no-brainer for this High Card strategy. That's an instant buy to level up the hand. It adds +10 chips and +1 mult, and takes High Card to level 4. This is the optimal play.\n\nThe Arcana Packs are tempting at $4 each. I could get Steel, Glass, or more Planets. Let's see...\n\nI have The Hierophant consumable, and The World consumable, to enhance my hand later in the next round. Both are in my inventory. I'll save them for the actual gameplay.\n\nI can spend $15 and still get maximum interest.\n\nSo, I'm going to grab Pluto from position 4 using `buy_and_use_consumable`. Let's confirm that's the correct command to immediately use the Planet card, bypassing my limited consumable inventory slots. Yes, that's correct. I'm using `buy_and_use_consumable` command with the position number of Pluto from the Shop Cards section.\n\nAfter Pluto, I'll still have $37. Now, let's execute the buy.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [4]"}
