{"reasoning":"**Analysis of a Balatro Standard Pack Choice**\n\nOkay, so I'm in a `STANDARD_PACK` stage. My build is all about maximizing face card synergy with `Photograph` and `Hanging Chad`. Ideally, I'm looking for face cards to enhance my hand. I've got a `Flush` at level 4 and a `Full House` at level 2 as possible hand options.\n\nRight, the choices are: an `8 of Diamonds` (+8 chips), a `Wild Card 2 of Hearts` (+2 chips and $3 when played), and a `Foil 3 of Diamonds` (+3 chips, +50 chips). None of these are face cards, so it's a matter of utility versus raw stats. The `Wild Card` helps with flushes, the `$3` bonus is okay, and the `Foil 3 of Diamonds` gives me a solid +50 chips. My `Mail-In Rebate` already gives me +50 chips. My `Trading Card` lets me destroy a card for $3, but that's not super helpful in this specific decision. The Wild Card is good for suit flexibility to get that flush level 4.\n\nI have to choose one card. The `Wild Card 2 of Hearts` is flexible for suits, the `Foil 3 of Diamonds` gives a straight boost. I really want face cards, but it seems there are no face cards here. There's no reason to *not* take a card (other than deck size).\n\nI'm thinking I'll pick the `Foil 3 of Diamonds`. It's a guaranteed +50 chips, which is a decent boost and it's a foil card. It won't hurt to have a card with a high value if I am forced to use it.\n\nWait, should I optimize my Joker order? Let's quickly review the Jokers: `Gift Card` (+10 Mult), `Mail-In Rebate` (+50 Chips), `Trading Card`, `Photograph` (x2 face card), and `Hanging Chad` (retrigger). Since my primary goal is face card scoring, `Photograph` and `Hanging Chad` are the key ones and trigger on \"scored.\" The `Gift Card`'s Holo Edition's +10 mult triggers as an \"Independent Joker\" (Step 5), so it happens *after* `Photograph`'s multipliers are applied. So, I don't need to reorder Jokers. `Photograph`'s X2 multipliers trigger on a face card in Step 3, and then `Gift Card`'s +10 is added in Step 5.\n\nAlright, back to the decision: the best choice is the `Foil 3 of Diamonds`. Let's select it and move on.\n\nJSON output is now:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [3]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
