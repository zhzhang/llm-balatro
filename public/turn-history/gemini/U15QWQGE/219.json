{"reasoning":"**The Endgame Calculation**\n\nOkay, here we go. Round 20, the Crimson Heart boss. The goal is 100,000 chips; I'm currently at 26,215. Two hands left, three discards. I need to squeeze every possible chip out of this. My hand is: 9♠ (Red Seal), J♥, 6♥, A♣, 8♣, and 2♣. I've got a killer setup with Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia, and Sock and Buskin (disabled).\n\nMy strategy here is clear: High Card is the best route with Stuntman and a level 9 score, but with Pareidolia, all cards are face cards. Sock and Buskin is disabled, so I can forget about re-triggering face cards via that Joker. But I do have Photograph (doubles the first face card played) and Hanging Chad (re-triggers the first played card twice) in play. The key is to get maximum value from the \"first played\" triggers. I need to play *one* card to exploit the multipliers.\n\nThe 9 of Spades (Red Seal) is the obvious choice. Red Seal gives me an additional trigger. Pareidolia makes it a face card for Photograph, and it's position 1. Stuntman is going to give me a decent chip bonus. So, if I play the 9 of Spades (Red Seal), I'm looking at a lot of triggers: the initial score, the Red Seal retrigger, and Hanging Chad retriggering it twice more. That means four triggers overall, with Photograph doubling the score each time.\n\nLet's do the math on the 9 of Spades (Red Seal). The base chip gain is the High Card base of 85, plus Stuntman's 250, and 9 chips for the card. The Stuntman also provides an additional 20 mult. So, base chips are 335 + 36 = 371. The Photograph multiplier applies each time the card scores due to the \"when scored\" wording.\n\nHere's the chain: Initial score, X2 (Photograph). Red Seal, X2 (Photograph). Chad 1, X2 (Photograph). Chad 2, X2 (Photograph). The base mult is 9, so this becomes: 9 -> 18 -> 36 -> 72 -> 144. Add in the Stuntman's 20, for a total mult of 164. Total score is therefore 371 * 164 = 60,844.\n\nNow, just to be sure, let's compare with the Ace of Clubs. This card only triggers 3 times. Base Chips stay at 371. The Ace base is 11, so: 85 + 250 + (11 * 3) = 368. Mult chain is: 9 -> 18 -> 36 -> 72 + 20 = 92. Total is 368 * 92 = 33,856. No, 9 of Spades (Red Seal) is clearly better.\n\nI need 73,785 more chips. The 9 of Spades gets me around 60k.  This means I'll have ~87,059 after this hand. With one hand remaining, as long as Photograph and Stuntman don't get disabled, I should easily clear the target.\n\nI'm playing the 9 of Spades (Position 1), hoping to net around ~60k. I’m wondering about the “when scored” trigger on Photograph. Does it trigger on every retrigger? Yup, it does. That's a key detail to this play.\n\nI also need to verify the multiplier math from previous hands. I have to make sure I understand how Jokers are interacting.  I need to trust what’s displayed.\n\nI've reviewed past hand results and verified my calculations. I need to trust the in-game calculations. There's an odd discrepancy in the recorded score calculation in a previous hand: In Turn 218, I calculated a value of 10,875, but the score was 7,125. It seems Stuntman's Holo bonus may not have applied due to an in-game display error. Recalculating with +10 rather than +20, the numbers add up.\n\nI’m now re-calculating the 9 of Spades with the corrected Stuntman numbers (+10 mult, to get to 19 total mult): It's actually:\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1]"}
