{"reasoning":"**Deep in the Numbers: The Perfect Play**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 6, Round 13. High Card strategy is the play, but this is all about scaling with Jokers and multipliers at this point. I've got a decent hand, and $28 to work with. The goal is clear: maximize that score.\n\nThe TAROT_PACK presents some interesting options. *Death* is the standout, of course. I have a Red Seal 9 of Spades (that's crucial, retriggers a card's ability) and a Holo 8 of Spades.  Holo is nice for +10 Mult, but the Red Seal is far more impactful. The Hanging Chad joker retriggers the first card, and with Pareidolia, all cards are Face Cards. With Smiley Face, Photograph, and Stuntman. My immediate thought is to clone that Red Seal.\n\nSo here are the cards in my hand:\n1.  9S (Red Seal)\n2.  8S (Holo)\n3.  9H\n4.  5H\n5.  8D\n6.  2D\n\nI analyze that *Death* is going to be amazing, but let's check the other options:\n*The Hermit* (double money, capped at $20) is tempting, but $20 is not as good as a Red Seal.\n*The Chariot* for steel is good. Steel is nice, but I already have a steel card in my deck and I can make steel cards with the *Chariot* consumable.\n*The Hanged Man* is useful for thinning the deck, but I'm playing High Card; any card works.\n\nI need to make that 2D into a second 9 of Spades (Red Seal). *Death* allows me to do that with: \"convert the left card into the right card.\" So the Red Seal must be on the right.\n\nSo let's move the 2D to the left and 9S to the right. I can't just `select 5 6 1`. The text is explicit \"convert the left card into the right card\". It doesn't use relative positions. So, the 2D must be to the left of the 9S.\n\nThe solution is to **rearrange** the hand: take 2D and put it as position 1. And then select Death:\n\n**Command Sequence:**\n1.  `rearrange_hand 6 1 2 3 4 5`\n2.  `select 5 1 2`\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_hand\"\nPositions: [6,1,2,3,4,5]"}
