{"reasoning":"**Current Hand Evaluation and Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 15. I'm in the middle of a TAROT_PACK (from Arcana Pack). I have $24, which is decent. My Jokers are Smiley Face (Face cards +5 Mult), Photograph (1st Face card x2 Mult), Hanging Chad (Retrigger 1st card 2x), Stuntman (Holo, +250 Chips, +10 Mult, -2 hand size), and Pareidolia (All cards are face cards). I also have The World consumable (Converts 3 to Spades, Max: 2), though I'm not sure how useful that will be in this build. My current hand is Jack Hearts, 7 Hearts, 6 Hearts, Jack Clubs, Jack Diamonds, and 8 Diamonds.\n\nThe build is all about High Card/Pair using the \"first played card\" synergy. Hanging Chad is the key. The first card played, because of Pareidolia, scores then retriggers twice. Photograph will trigger on that first face card.\n\nSo, here's how it breaks down:\n1.  The first card scores (Photograph x2, Smiley +5 Mult, Stuntman +250 Chips, +10 Mult).\n2.  Chad Retrigger 1 (Photograph x2, Smiley +5 Mult).\n3.  Chad Retrigger 2 (Photograph x2, Smiley +5 Mult).\n\nThat gives me Chips += 250 and Mult = (Base + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5) * 2 * 2 * 2 = (Base + 25) * 8, on the *first card*. That's pretty strong for High Card.\n\nNow, let's look at the Arcana cards:\n*   *The Lovers (Wild)*: This is not particularly useful. I'm not fishing for Flushes or specific suits.\n*   *The Devil (Gold)*: This is great for an economy boost. It gives $3 if held, and since I usually have 5+ cards in hand, it's a good way to build for the final Ante.\n*   *Strength*: Increases rank. This is OK, but with Pareidolia, they're all face cards anyway. Not the biggest impact.\n\nI'm focused on the economy since I have $24 now and Gold cards offer a nice way to build it. I have to pick a target card. I'll pick Position 6, the 8 of Diamonds, or Position 3, the 6 of Hearts. It doesn't matter which one because I don't plan to play it.\n\nSo, the action is `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> ...`. I need to select The Devil (2) and target the 8 of Diamonds (Position 6). I input the position as 2. And target Position 6.\n\nI think the 9 of Spades (Red Seal) is from the previous turn and not in my hand list since I'm in the middle of a Pack and the game is showing me the *current* hand at this moment.\n\nLet's quickly check Strength targets. Increasing a Jack to a Queen (or any rank increase) doesn't change the scoring logic much.\n\nThe Gold Card is the most consistent value here.\n\nThe World consumable is taking up a slot. If I take The Devil as a card, I have to use it. Arcana packs are \"choose and use.\"\n\nWait, is The Devil a card to *take* or *use*? The description says \"Enhances 1 selected card...\" Okay, this is used immediately.\n\nMy \"select\" positions are [2, 6] (Choice 2: The Devil, Target card 6: 8 of Diamonds). Let's go!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,6]"}
