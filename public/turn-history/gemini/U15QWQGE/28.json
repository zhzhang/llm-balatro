{"reasoning":"**My Strategy for The Window**\n\nOkay, here we go. Boss Blind, The Window. 1600 chips needed, and all Diamond cards are debuffed, so I'll be avoiding those. I've got a decent amount of money, so I'm not *too* worried about cash. I have a Holo Gift Card for +10 Mult, a Foil Mail-In Rebate for +50 Chips and $5 per discarded 8, a Trading Card that I used earlier (destroyed first discard), and a Photograph that doubles the Mult of the first played face card.\n\nMy Joker order matters, so let's check: Gift Card (Mult), Mail-In Rebate (Chips), Photograph (X-Mult). Hold up, checking the rules... Photograph triggers *during* the card scoring phase (step 3), and Gift Card is a separate multiplier (step 5). So the double mult from Photograph will be applied *before* the Gift Card adds +10, which isn't optimal, but I'll work with it.\n\nI've got a decent starting hand: Ace of Spades, 10 of Spades, 2 of Spades, King of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs, and 4 of Clubs. I have two discards remaining. I need to make a solid play; a Full House or a Flush would be ideal.\n\nLet's calculate a *hypothetical* Full House (Tens over something): Base is 40 Chips, 4 Mult. The Jokers would be the Mail-In Rebate (+50 Chips), the Gift Card (+10 Mult), and the Photograph (X2 if a face card plays). If I play the King of Hearts in this Full House, the Photograph will double the mult. This would give me approximately 130 Chips and 18 Mult, scoring me around 2340 chips! That clears it!\n\nWait, do I even *have* a Full House? I have two 10s...I need another 10 or another pair. Nope, I don't have another pair.\n\nCurrently, I have Aces, Kings, and 10s. I need a 10, Ace, King, or another pair. So, I need to ditch what isn't helping. I could try to make a Two Pair...but I don't have enough to fill this hand. High Card (King): base is 5 chips, 1 mult, and using the Photograph and Gift Card, the score would only be 780. Not good enough.\n\nOkay, time to discard the trash: 2 of Spades, 5 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 4 of Clubs. I'll keep the Ace, two 10s, and the King. Wait... if I'm going for the Heart Flush, I should keep the Heart King, 5, 3.\n\nI've got three Hearts already, and there are 15 Hearts left in the deck. ~40% chance. Let's chase that Flush. I'll discard the Ace of Spades, 10 of Spades, 2 of Spades, 10 of Clubs, and 4 of Clubs. That leaves me with the King of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, and 3 of Hearts. The Flush (Level 2) is 50 chips, 6 mult. With the King of Hearts...it will be around 130 chips and 22 mult, scoring me 2860! That will easily clear the 1600.\n\nI have two discards left! And wait... I have two 8s left, so Mail-In Rebate gives me $5 for each discarded 8. I'll get that if I get an 8.\n\nAlright, time for action! I'll discard those cards and keep my Hearts. Ready to win! Let's go!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,7,8]"}
