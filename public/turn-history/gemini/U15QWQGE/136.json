{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Ante 6, Round 12 - Buffoon Pack**\n\nAlright, let's take a look at this Buffoon Pack. Current situation: Ante 6, Round 12. I've got $34. My Joker setup is Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad (Holo), Stuntman, and Pareidolia – a beautiful, tightly-knit High Card synergy going on. Jokers are maxed out at 5/5, consumables are full as well, so there's no room for expansion. The available packs are Mystic Summit and Riff-raff.\n\nMystic Summit promises +15 Mult when zero discards remain, but with this current build, it's just a drop in the bucket. My High Card strategy is already generating a significant score, potentially somewhere between 30k-100k per play, depending on other factors (maybe I was misremembering before; I'll re-verify the math), and that's more than enough for this Ante. Riff-raff sounds intriguing, spawning Common Jokers, but I have no space. It's useless without open slots. Selling a key Joker for random commons is a terrible trade-off right now, especially considering how well the current build is scaling.\n\nThe core of my strategy relies on these synergistic Jokers. Smiley Face boosts face cards. Pareidolia makes all cards face cards. Photograph doubles the first face card's Multiplier. Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card, doubling the impact, and Stuntman provides extra chips and mult. Each Joker significantly contributes to the overall power. Replacing any of these pieces with either of the available options would be a net loss. The math just doesn't work out; even with Stuntman, I don't need the extra help. Selling one joker would get me $2-7, which is a poor trade.\n\nThere's no point in considering Mystic Summit or Riff-raff. Therefore, the most logical decision is to skip this pack altogether. I'm going to stick with the established, proven strategy and keep building this exponential growth.\n\nAction: `skip_booster`.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"skip_booster\"}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
