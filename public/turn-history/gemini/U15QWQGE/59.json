{"reasoning":"**Celestial Pack First, Then Evaluate**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 5 with a 3/8 ante, facing the big blind completion and $59 in the bank. The Goad (Spades debuff) is looming – gotta be smart about maximizing score potential and preparing for that Boss Blind. My current joker setup is pretty solid: Gift Card (Holo) for the flat mult and sell value, Mail-In Rebate (Foil) for the chips and discard money, Trading Card for deck thinning (crucial), Photograph as the core scoring engine, and Hanging Chad to really juice that Photograph's multiplier. I've got a Justice consumable in my back pocket too.\n\nLooking at the shop, Blue Joker is tempting for a flat +100 chips, but Mail-In Rebate already provides a decent chip boost and some money. I'm hesitant to sell a joker slot. Even Steven isn't ideal given my focus on Face cards right now. Hallucination could be interesting with some pack synergy, but again, full joker slots.\n\nMy instincts tell me to prioritize hand leveling. Since I have decent money ($59), I need to choose my next move wisely. The Celestial Pack at $4 offers immediate hand leveling, which is always valuable. Jumbo Standard Pack gives deck manipulation, which is good. Hallucination could give more tarots.\n\nThe main scoring combo is Photograph + Hanging Chad, yielding X8 mult on the first face card. Gift Card adds +10 flat mult. I do want to get the deck thinning from Trading Card, but I also want to get to the Celestial Pack. I have the Mail-In Rebate, which is good for the money.\n\nOkay, let's start with the Celestial Pack. It's cheap and provides immediate value to level up a Flush or Three of a Kind. That's the priority now. Then, I'll revisit the shop. Maybe consider Blue Joker if the discards aren't as relevant anymore. But that also means selling.\n\nNo must-buy vouchers or rerolls, so it's a straightforward decision.\n\nTherefore, the action is to buy the Celestial Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
