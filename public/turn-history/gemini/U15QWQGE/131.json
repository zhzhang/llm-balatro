{"reasoning":"**Blind Select - Let's Crush This Round**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 5/8, Round 11. Current money's looking decent at $29, and the target is 22,000 chips. The boss, \"The Pillar\", discards 2 random cards per hand played, but since I'm playing a single High Card, that won't directly affect the score of my played card, only my hand size in the subsequent round.\n\nI've got a killer joker setup: Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Photograph (x2 Mult for first face card), Hanging Chad (Retrigger first played card 2 times), Stuntman (Holo) (+250 Chips, +10 Mult), and Pareidolia (All cards are face cards). No consumables are needed right now, as it's Blind Select. Vouchers are Overstock, Overstock Plus, and Director's Cut – good for later.\n\nThe plan is simple: leverage the High Card with that ridiculous Joker synergy. Let's break down the score: A Level 2 High Card gives 15 base chips and 2 mult. The played card (assuming Rank 10) adds another 10 chips, and Stuntman kicks in 250 chips. So, base chips are 275.\n\nNow for the multiplier. Here's where it gets wild. Each scoring trigger sequence goes left to right: Smiley Face adds 5 and Photograph doubles it, repeating this 3 times because of Hanging Chad. And the logic's right because I want to add before multiplying.\n\n1.  Trigger 1: Base is 2 mult + 5 from Smiley -> 7 mult. 7 * 2 (Photgraph) -> 14 mult.\n2.  Trigger 2 (Chad Retrigger 1): 14 mult + 5 (Smiley) -> 19 mult. 19 * 2 (Photograph) -> 38 mult.\n3.  Trigger 3 (Chad Retrigger 2): 38 mult + 5 (Smiley) -> 43 mult. 43 * 2 (Photograph) -> 86 mult.\n\nThen Stuntman gives +10, so a total of 96 mult. Total Score: 275 chips * 96 mult = ~26,400. That easily clears the 22,000 target. The Joker order is perfect (Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia), because Smiley Face needs to be to the left of the Photograph modifier.\n\nRisk is low. No need to reroll the boss. Just need to select the High Card. No consumables or rearrangements needed, so let's hit `play_round` with a High Card.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
