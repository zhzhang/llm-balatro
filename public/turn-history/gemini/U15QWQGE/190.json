{"reasoning":"**Ante 8/8, Shop Decision Time**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: last ante, aiming for maximum High Card to secure the win. Got $31, and my hand is looking like this: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), and Pareidolia, plus The World consumable. My High Card level is already at 6, with 55 chips and 6 mult.\n\nThe shop's offering The Hermit, Droll Joker, Pluto, and Merry Andy. Droll Joker's a non-starter since I'm High Card focused. Merry Andy's out too, considering Stuntman's hand size penalty, and it'd make it even worse. The Hermit's the obvious first buy; it's a no-brainer to double my money (max +$20) to hit $48 and increase my buying power significantly. Then, I'll grab Pluto to level up High Card.\n\nLet's see, The Hermit is at position 1, and Pluto is at position 3 in the shop. After that, it's all about rerolling for better options. I could use Celestial packs for more Pluto cards, or some better Jokers.\n\nMy current action is to \"buy_and_use_consumable\".  I need to use The Hermit (position 1) to maximize my budget. I've got a free consumable slot, so no issues there.\n\nThe Hermit will take me from $31 to $48. After that I'll buy Pluto. I'll need to double check the schema for that, but I am confident. Then evaluate the next purchase/reroll.\n\nJust to be sure, I'll calculate the value of the Pluto to double check my plan. Right now the high card lvl is 6. With Stuntman: 305 Chips, 6 Mult (+10 Holo). With the three triggers, I get 39,040. If I buy Pluto, and increase the high card level from 6 -> 7, the values are: 315 Chips, 17 Mult. With the three triggers, I get 42,840. The Hermit first will maximize my chances of buying Pluto, and rerolling if I can't.\n\nAlright, action is \"buy_and_use_consumable\", and the position is 1 (The Hermit).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
