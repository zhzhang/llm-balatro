{"reasoning":"**Mercury: The Prudent Pick**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 10, Ante 5/8, and staring down a Jumbo Celestial Pack. Got $31. The whole strategy is *definitely* centered around High Card scaling with the face card synergy of *Pareidolia*, *Smiley Face*, *Photograph*, and *Hanging Chad*. *Stuntman* is making things a bit trickier with that -2 hand size. The goal is to maximize the pack value, and ideally grab something to help the hand along.\n\nMy immediate thought is that *Pluto* (High Card) isn't in the pack, so we need a backup plan. I'm evaluating the options: *Mercury* (Pair), *Jupiter* (Flush – already at Level 5), *Mars* and *Earth* (challenging for the small hand), and *Uranus* (Two Pair – also tricky). \n\nMy initial inclination is to go with *Mercury* because it's the easiest fallback hand. Since I've been exclusively High Card for a while now, this would provide some versatility. It brings Pair from level 1 to level 2. *Jupiter* is tempting because it's already leveled, but the current Joker engine makes it not worth it.\n\nHowever, before I make a decision, let's just make sure the Joker order is still right. The system prompt confirms that the order is: Smiley, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. This should be good, since the order is: (Additive, Multiplicative, Retrigger, Independent Multiplier, all cards are face).\n\nNow, with a second look, *Mercury* still looks the safest. I'm taking that *Mercury* card to level Pair to Level 2. So, despite Jupiter being level 5 and the temptation, it's not the most useful. So, I will pick Mercury. The setup is really strong, and there's no reason to sell a Joker at this point.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
