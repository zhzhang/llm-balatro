{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Balatro Shop for Maximum Score**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4, Round 7, with the Big Blind looming, and I've got $51. My current Joker setup is pretty solid: Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. I also have Justice and The World consumables. The goal, as always, is to maximize my score for future blinds.\n\nLooking at the shop, Acrobat (x3 final hand) is tempting, but right now, I think Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards) is the play. My current setup leans heavily into face cards with Pareidolia (everything is a face card), which will synergize perfectly with Smiley Face. Hanging Chad is also great because it will retrigger the first card in the hand twice, and Photograph will double the face value. I sold \"Gift Card\" previously to make room for Smiley Face.\n\nBefore I commit, though, I need to think about Joker order. Smiley Face triggers \"when scored,\" as does Photograph. I need to make sure the +5 from Smiley Face is added *before* the X2 from Photograph. Thinking back to Balatro's rules, triggered effects happen from left to right. Therefore, Smiley Face should be on the left.\n\nI have one open Joker slot. So, I need to buy Smiley Face (Shop card #2). I can consider Acrobat later, but Stuntman is providing a significant chip boost right now. I don't need to consider any consumables.\n\nI have double-checked the logic and confirm that Smiley Face is the best option right now. I also double-checked current Joker count and slots available, to ensure there are no issues.\n\nOkay, time to purchase.\n\n*   Action: `buy_card`\n*   `card_position`: 2\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
