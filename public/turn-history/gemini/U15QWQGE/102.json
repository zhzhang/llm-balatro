{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: A Celestial Pack Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 9, and I've got a Celestial Pack staring me down. Fifty-eight bucks in the bank. The plan is clear: High Card is the name of the game, leveraging these Jokers: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. Pareidolia is the key, turning everything into face cards. Hanging Chad is a beast, retriggering that initial card, and Photograph doubles it, with Smiley Face adding a flat +5 Mult for each face card. Stuntman gives a solid chip and mult boost, though the hand size reduction is a factor. I also have Justice, but that doesn't seem relevant.\n\nMy hand levels: High Card is level 1, Flush is level 4 (my highest \"natural\" hand) - I also have Full House at level 2.\n\nThe pack gives me three planets: Jupiter (Flush), Venus (Three of a Kind), and Earth (Full House). No Pluto, which is what I'd be looking for to improve High Card. This is a bit annoying, I could have used a High Card card, and I'm not going to be able to use any of these planets to improve my current strategy.\n\nI'm thinking, do I even need to pick a planet? Well, since I bought the pack I must, so I might as well pick the highest-level hand to scale, as this strategy is all about High Card. Flush is level 4, the highest I can get.\n\nBut wait, hold on, it's not even about the planet. It's about the math. With the Jokers I have, I need to make sure the order of my Jokers is right. First, Smiley Face, then Photograph. This is *crucial* because the order of *on-score* effects matters. Then, Hanging Chad follows.\n\nIf I play a single King (due to Stuntman), the Jokers trigger: Smiley Face, then Photograph, then Hanging Chad (twice). Stuntman then adds its benefits at the end. I re-calculate: (1 + 5) * 2 = 12. Then, (12 + 5) * 2 = 34. Again: (34 + 5) * 2 = 78. Plus the Stuntman mult bonus to 88, plus the chip bonus to 260. Which results in a solid score of 22,880.\n\nI think through the value of skipping. Nah, no point. So, I need to pick something.\n\nSo the action is to *select* Jupiter. Yep, I'm sticking with Jupiter because it's a useful backup to level up the flush. So, the position is `1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
