{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 2, Round 1 shop. I've got $6, and a decent starting inventory: a Holo Gift Card (+10 Mult, which is excellent for long-term value), a Foil Mail-In Rebate (+50 chips on Aces, fantastic for immediate scoring), and a Trading Card (which is fine, but potentially useful for early game deck thinning and money). I see a Celestial Pack for $4, a reroll voucher at $10 (way out of reach), and a shop reroll at $5 (too expensive).\n\nMy immediate thought is to evaluate the trade-off. Do I buy that Celestial Pack for a potential hand upgrade, or do I focus on building my bankroll? The pack is tempting, especially since I need to start thinking about which hand to lean into. But with my current jokers, I'm already in a good position to handle the small blind. The +50 chips and +10 multiplier from Mail-In Rebate and Gift Card, even with just a High Card or Pair, gets me well over the required score. I already spent $4 to get Trading Card.\n\nConsidering my hand, the priority is to conserve cash for interest (earning $1 with $6) and potentially maxing out my interest income by getting to $25. The Celestial Pack seems like a gamble at this stage, especially given that it’s probably a planet for a hand I don't need. Plus, interest accumulation is key in Balatro. Buying that pack now leaves me with $2, and no interest.\n\nI've already got a good economy engine starting with Trading Card (early money) and Mail-In Rebate (money per Ace, rank changes). I have to remember to check if Mail-In Rebate is still paying out. It seems like it's still Ace, so that's $5 per discarded Ace this round. The order of the Jokers isn't critical for these two specific effects, since addition is commutative (Chips and +Mult).\n\nLooking back at the previous turn (Turn 10), I had $10 and I purchased a Buffoon Pack for $4. I picked up Trading Card from that pack. Getting out of the shop now is the most efficient play.\n\nTherefore, the play is clear: I'm going to select the round. I'm going to conserve cash, make use of the excellent jokers, and start building towards max interest. Long-term bankroll is more important than a potential hand upgrade right now. I'm strong enough to beat the next blind.\n\nSo, `round_select` is the play. Time to execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
