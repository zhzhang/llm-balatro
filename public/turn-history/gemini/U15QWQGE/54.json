{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy Evaluation and Next Steps**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. We're in Ante 3, Round 4. Got $34. The primary goal is to maximize the scoring potential, given the current hand levels and joker setup. Flush level 4 is my strongest option.\n\nCurrently running with the following Jokers: `Gift Card`, `Mail-In Rebate`, `Trading Card`, `Photograph`, and `Hanging Chad`. The `Justice` consumable is equipped.\n\nI'm evaluating shop cards, particularly `Bootstraps`, `Satellite`, and `Green Joker`. `Bootstraps` provides scaling Mult, but I'd need to sell a Joker to buy it. Currently, `Trading Card` or `Mail-In Rebate` seems like the most replaceable, but `Mail-In Rebate` gives +50 chips. `Green Joker` doesn't fit my discard strategy, and `Satellite` isn't proving its worth yet ($2).\n\n`Bootstraps`, with the current money, would provide +12 mult. My current build hinges on `Photograph` and `Hanging Chad` for face card multipliers. `Hanging Chad` and `Photograph` combine for an X8 multiplier on the first face card. With a flush of 10 base mult, that's 80.  The `Gift Card` provides +10 mult on top of that, which would bring it to a total of 90 mult. Adding in `Bootstraps` will then bring it to 102 mult. But I'm not sure if it's worth replacing a current Joker.\n\nI'm thinking about whether to replace `Trading Card` or `Mail-In Rebate`. `Trading Card` is good for deck thinning, and `Mail-In Rebate` gives me +50 chips. The shop options are not \"must-buys\" right now. I've already rerolled twice already. Let's see.\n\nI'm at $34. Rerolling again costs $7, and I'll still be at the interest cap if I do it, and the Big Blind is coming up. The *sell value* of `Gift Card` increases every round, which makes this joker even better. I'm strong enough to win this round, with the X8 face card multiplier.\n\nI'd really prefer to find more planets or better Tarot cards in the shop. The current shop is weak. I've spent enough on rerolls and will save the rest for a future shop, if I don't see anything I want. I've already rerolled twice. The next blind is the Big Blind. I will move on to the next round, after spending $0.\n\nI need to focus on finding cards that amplify my face card strategy. I will check the Joker order.\n\n`Hanging Chad` retriggers the *first* played card, and `Photograph` applies X2 to the *first* face card, on score. The order between `Photograph` and `Hanging Chad` matters:\n\n1.  A face card is played and scores.\n2.  `Photograph` triggers.\n3.  `Hanging Chad` retriggers.\n4.  `Photograph` checks again, and triggers.\n\nThe fact that the first face card is multiplied every time makes `Hanging Chad` and `Photograph` good. So having other +Mult Jokers *before* `Photograph` would be huge. My `Gift Card` Mult is added in the last step, so its placement is not important.\n\nI have $34, and the interest cap is $25. Rerolling still gives me interest. Let's just go to the next round. I'm strong enough. I just need to check the effect for the `Mail-In Rebate`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
