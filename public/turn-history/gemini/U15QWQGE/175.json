{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante and Preparing for the Boss**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 7/8, about to face \"The Eye\". This boss prevents repeating hand types, which means I need a flexible strategy. Currently, my plan is built around High Card with a bit of Face Card synergy, using the \"Pareidolia\" Joker to make everything a Face Card. The existing Joker setup is already pretty potent: \"Smiley Face\" gives +5 Mult per Face Card, \"Photograph\" doubles the first Face Card's multiplier, \"Hanging Chad\" retriggers the first played card twice, and \"Stuntman\" adds a flat +250 chips and +10 mult, and \"Pareidolia\" makes every card a face.\n\nI've got $58, \"The World\" consumable, and some vouchers – a \"Telescope\" (for guaranteed Pluto in Celestial Packs), \"Director's Cut\" (to reroll the boss), and \"Overstock Plus\". The shop is pretty lackluster, offering a \"Green Joker\" (too late to scale), a Joker (+4 mult) that's not worth the slot, a \"Business Card\" (economy-focused), and \"Splash\" (not needed for High Card).\n\nThe critical thing is to level up High Card (Pluto) to ensure I can beat Ante 8 and survive the boss by having a high enough score on the first High Card play or being able to play a Pair/Two Pair once if needed.\n\nGiven the current shop options and my cash, rerolling seems like the only sensible move. I'm looking for Celestial Packs (Pluto), better Jokers (though what I have is synergistic), or potentially some impactful Tarot cards.\n\nNow, with \"The Eye\" forcing hand variety, I might need to cycle through hands. High Card is my best bet right now, but I might need a Pair or Two Pair. Since High Card is level 4 (35 chips, 4 mult) and Pair is level 3 (40 chips, 4 mult), and every card is a face card, the scoring for a Pair will be similar to High Card, just with an extra card scoring chips and Smiley Face triggers. More importantly, with Hanging Chad and Photograph, only the *first* played card matters for the massive multipliers. So playing a Pair is effectively just as good as High Card for the primary multipliers.\n\n**Reroll Time!**\n\nRerolling. Got plenty of cash ($58) and need to find Pluto cards.\n\nMy current Jokers are Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. I need to confirm the *order* is correct. \"Hanging Chad\" says it \"Retriggers first played card used in scoring 2 additional times.\" and \"Photograph\" says, \"First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored.\" Also, \"Smiley Face\" says \"Played face cards give +5 Mult when scored.\" So the order matters.\n\nWhen the first card scores:\n1.  Smiley triggers (+5).\n2.  Photo triggers (X2).\n3.  Chad retriggers (repeat 1 & 2 twice).\n\nThe order is correct: Smiley (1), Photo (2), Chad (3). Stuntman is flat at the end. Pareidolia makes the whole thing work, since I can play any card. Conclusion: Joker order is correct.\n\n**The Plan is Set**\n\nI'm rerolling the shop. No real reason to buy anything else. No reason to sell any Jokers (they are synergistic). No need to use \"The World\" yet, either, since I want to save it. Reroll is the only hope here. I'm well above the $25 interest cap. Spending $9 won't hurt, so, it's the only plan for now.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\nCost: $9.\nMoney after: $49.\nGoal: Find Celestial Pack/Pluto.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
