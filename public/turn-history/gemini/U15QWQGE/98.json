{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Boss Blind: The Psychic**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase for \"The Psychic,\" aiming for 10,000 chips. I've got a decent Joker setup: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. The key is clearly the interaction between Pareidolia making all cards face cards, and then leveraging Photograph and Smiley Face's \"On scored\" effects, triggered by Hanging Chad.\n\nI've already figured out the Joker order matters here. Smiley Face before Photograph is crucial for maximizing the additive bonus before the multiplier kicks in.  Based on my previous calculations, the current order (Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia) is correct for maximizing the multiplier. I've run the numbers. With the current build: I'll play a high card. The first card's base mult (1) is hit by the Smiley face (+5), and then photograph (x2), then retried two times by Hanging Chad. Finally, the Stuntman triggers (+10). This means a total of 88 mult total.\n\nNow, the important consideration: \"The World\" consumable. I want to sell it because I have a Blue Seal 10 of Diamonds that creates a planet card at the end of the round, requiring an open consumable slot. Since I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase, I can sell now before I start the round, which is the cleanest move.\n\nI've already determined I need to sell something. My previous action was `round_select` after visiting the shop. It looks like I accidentally skipped the sell action. I'm going to sell \"The World\" (position 2) right now. No need to overthink this. I can always double-check the strategy again later. The Blue Seal + Planet strategy is the priority.\n\nThen, there's the hand size. Stuntman reduces hand size by 2, leaving me with 6 cards. The \"Psychic\" requires me to play 5. Plus, I want to *hold* the Blue Seal 10 of Diamonds, which makes a planet, so 5 + 1 = 6. Perfect fit.\n\n**Action: `sell_consumable`**\n**Position: 2 (The World)**\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
