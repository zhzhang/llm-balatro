{"reasoning":"**Final Preparations for the Psychic**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. We're in Ante 4, Round 8, sitting pretty with $47. The engine is humming along thanks to a solid Joker lineup: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo!), and Pareidolia. We just clocked a sweet 60k High Card last round, and we're looking to replicate that dominance against \"The Psychic\" boss.\n\nThe key to this round is going to be optimizing the Joker order to maximize the multiplier. We've got Pareidolia turning everything into face cards, setting off the rest of the engine. Here's the sequence we're going with: Smiley Face (+5 mult on face) -> Photograph (X2 mult on first face) -> Hanging Chad (Retriggers). Then comes Stuntman.\n\nMy hand size is 6, thanks to Stuntman's -2. The Psychic requires 5 cards played, so that leaves 1 card in hand. The ideal scenario is that this final card is my Blue Seal, which can give me the Planet card.\n\nNow, we need to clear a consumable slot for that Planet card, so the first thing I'll do is sell \"The World\". This is a no-brainer, and I have to act now. I'm going with `sell_consumable 2`. It seems that the best path to winning is to focus my energy on that, and save any unnecessary shop actions until after the sell.\n\nAlright, the next thing is just to move to the next round. I'll take a final look at the shop for other options but, with the engine and the clear path of selling the consumable, I'm going with `round_select`.\n\nIt's going to be a good round. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
