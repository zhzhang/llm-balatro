Right now, I'm sitting on $4 and completely empty-handed\\u2014no Jokers, no consumables, nothing. The Boss effect, \\\"The Heart,\\\" is a real pain. All Hearts are debuffed, so they contribute nothing, zero chips, though they still count for hand formation. Gotta keep that in mind.\\n\\nSince it's a Boss Blind, skipping isn't an option. My only play here is to\\u2026 well, play a round. Let's see, chips, Jokers... yeah, `play_round` is the only move available.\\n\\nAlright, double-checking the rules: no skips on Boss blinds, I need 600 chips, I got nothing but base cards, and Hearts are useless. The action is clear. I'm going to submit `play_round`. Time to see what hands I'm dealt and get cracking.

Ante 1, selecting hand. Inventory is clean, no Jokers, no consumables. I've got the Foil and Holographic tags, which are for later, so nothing to worry about now. Four dollars in the bank. The goal is a hefty 600 chips to beat the boss. Hearts are debuffed, so that Ace, 9, and 3 are going to be essentially worthless chip-wise. Four hands, four discards.\\n\\nLet's see the cards: Ace of Hearts, debuffed, that's an immediate non-starter. Two more debuffed Hearts. A 9 of Clubs, looking good. 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds, 7 of Diamonds. Okay, some potential.\\n\\nThe immediate possibilities:\\n\\n*   **Two Pair:** 9s and 7s, gets us about 104 chips. Meh.\\n*   **Three of a Kind:** The 9s. We're looking at around 144. Better, but still not enough.\\n*   **High Card:** That Ace, which is now just a single card. Pass.\\n\\nI need about 150 chips per hand, on average, to win. Okay, so playing that Three of a Kind of 9s is an okay starting point. It's a solid 144 chips, but is there a way to *significantly* improve?\\n\\nI have the 9 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds. A pair of 7 Clubs and 7 Diamonds. That's a Full House. If I discard the useless Hearts and fish for better cards... What if I can discard 3 cards and get a higher value?\\n\\nLooking at the deck composition:\\n*   Clubs are: 10\\n*   Spades: 13\\n*   Diamonds: 11\\n*   There's only 1 more 9 remaining.\\n*   There's 2 more 7s left.\\n*   The rest are Jacks, Kings, Queens, and Aces.\\n\\nPlaying the Three of a Kind gets us 144 chips. But wait! I could have a Full House of 9s and 7s. Let's see... base of 40 chips, plus the individual card chip values: the 9's (0, 9, 9) and the 7's (7, 7) for a value of 72. Then multiply that by 4, for a total of 288 chips!\\n\\n288 chips! That's almost half the goal!\\n\\nOkay, let's do the math again. 9 of Hearts is debuffed. With a full house: (40 + 0 + 9 + 9 + 7 + 7) * 4 = 288. Brilliant!\\n\\nI only need 312 more chips. Now, only needing 104 per hand is extremely doable. Two Pair at around 100 chips would be possible, and I could even consider high cards/pairs.\\n\\nCould I get a flush? I have 3 Clubs, but with two more slots, let's discard those hearts and two diamonds. The deck has a lot of Clubs and Spades. Flush (35 + cards) * 4. But 288 is stronger in Ante 1.\\n\\nThe cards in positions 2, 4, 7 (9s), and 5, 8 (7s) make a full house. I'm seeing it. 2, 4, 7, 5, 8: 9 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds, 7 of Clubs, and 7 of Diamonds.\\n\\nTwo Pair (9s and 7s) and Ace: it doesn't score! 104, 104 versus 288.\\n\\nSo the 9 of Hearts is debuffed. Does it still count? The \\\"debuffed\\\" description specifically says it still *participates* in hand formation.\\n\\n**Action: PLAY.**\\n**Positions: 2, 4, 7, 5, 8**\\n**Intended Hand Type: Full House.**\\n**Chips: 288.**\\n\\nChecking again: Hand is Full House (3x 9s, 2x 7s). The 9 of Hearts has a value of zero. Then: (40 + 0 + 9 + 9 + 7 + 7) * 4 = 288.\\n\\nCould it be another combo? No. This 5 cards is stronger than a Flush right now\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 2 4 7 5 8 full house 288\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 5]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Foil Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil\\n2: Holographic Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Boss.\\nBoss Description: All Heart cards are debuffed.\\nChips Needed: 600\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 10 of Spades.

Got 288 chips, need 600 total. The Boss Blind, \\\"The Heart\\\", is active, so those Hearts are useless for chip-generation, but still *count* for hand formation. I'm looking at a hand with a potential Full House: 5s and 3s. Let's see, what do we have? We have a 10 of Spades, a 3 of Spades, a debuffed Ace of Hearts, a debuffed 5 of Hearts, a debuffed 3 of Hearts, a Queen of Clubs, a 5 of Clubs, and a 5 of Diamonds.\\n\\nThinking this through, the best play is definitely a Full House with those 5s and 3s. I can see the \\\"Three of a Kind\\\" base is 30, and the \\\"Full House\\\" base is 40. Then calculate the total chip contribution from the cards, which will be affected by debuffing. Let's see...30 chips for the 3 of a Kind, and 10 for the card chips, with a multiplier of 3. So a Full House of 5s and 3s... (40 base + 13 card chip) * 4 multiplier, will give me 212. 212 added to the 288 I already have will give me 500, with 100 remaining to get.\\n\\nIf I play this Full House, that looks safe. But let's check. Could I find a better hand with a discard? I have 4 discards available. I could ditch some of these cards and try to find something better than 212 chips. No.\\n\\nI need 312 more, 212 is a huge step. I *could* ditch some to find something better. No. This feels safe.\\n\\nAlright, let's nail down the cards. 3 of Spades, 5 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 5 of Clubs, and 5 of Diamonds. Confirmed, that's a Full House. Math check: (40 base + 3 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 5 = 53) * 4 = 212. Got it. This gets me to 500 total. The hand *is* a Full House. Confirmed. I'd then need 100 more chips in the next two rounds, which should be easily achievable.\\n\\nI've got the hand type, the expected chips, and the positions. No Jokers, no special effects. My logic is sound. Let's do this. I'm going to play that Full House. Time to execute.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 2 4 5 7 8 full house 212\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Foil Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil\\n2: Holographic Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Boss.\\nBoss Description: All Heart cards are debuffed.\\nChips Needed: 600\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Jack of Spades.

  "reasoning": "**Analyzing the Hand - Time to Discard!**\n\nOkay, so the ante is 1/8, and we're in Round 1 against \"The Heart\" boss, which debuffs Hearts. We need 600 chips total, we're currently at 500, and we need 100 more this round. We have two hands left and four discards. Time to think.\n\nLet's see what we're working with here. We've got a Jack of Spades (+10), a 10 of Spades (+10), a 9 of Spades (+9), a 4 of Spades (+4), and then three debuffed Hearts (Ace, King, Queen, all worth 0), and a Queen of Clubs (+10). Hmm.\n\nHigh Card (Queen of Clubs) is only worth 15. Too low. The Pair of Queens (0+10) is 40. Still not enough. Two Pair? Nope. Three of a Kind? Nope. Flush? We have four Spades, but need one more. Straight? Q, J, 10, 9 - missing an 8 or King.\n\nWe need 100 more chips. A Pair gets us around 40, Two Pair about 80-100, Three of a Kind is 120-150, a Straight or Flush is 150-250.\n\nI have 4 discards left. Time to discard the junk, the debuffed Hearts and the low-value 4 of Spades.\n\nLet's look at the deck. 7 Hearts (all debuffed), 9 Clubs, 10 Diamonds, and 8 Spades remaining. Also, a few 8s, 7s, Jacks, Kings and Queens.\n\nSo if I discard 4, 5, 6, 7 (4 of Spades, Ace, King, Queen of Hearts), I'm keeping the good cards: Jack, 10, 9 of Spades and Queen of Clubs.\n\nWait, I only need 100. Should I just play the Pair of Queens? It's (10 + 0 + 10) * 2 = 40 chips. Not enough for round 1, let's discard. But, is discarding the correct choice? Yes, 4 discards, so free, and keeps my \"hands played\" count low.\n\nDiscard 4, 5, 6, 7. I need to get rid of them.\n\nNow I am going to discard 4, 5, 6, 7. I am really sure about this, let's discard 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nOkay, let's double check... Straight? Queen, Jack, 10, 9... missing an 8 or King. Flush? We have 4 Spades. If I discard, I'm looking for a Spade (Flush), or an 8/King (Straight). Three of a Kind? Two Pair? \n\nDiscarding all debuffed and low-value cards maximizes our chances. Discarding 4 cards: Positions [4, 5, 6, 7].\n\nOkay, wait, should I keep the 4 of Spades? It helps with a Flush. Current Spades: J, 10, 9, 4. 8 Spades left in the deck. The probability of drawing at least one Spade in 3 cards is around 57%, but I don't necessarily need a Flush. Two Pair or Three of a Kind are also fine.\n\nI need 100. Discard the cards which are not helpful.\n\nDiscarding 4 cards: 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nDiscard the cards.\n\nHand: J-Spades, 10-Spades, 9-Spades, 4-Spades, A-Hearts(D), K-Hearts(D), Q-Hearts(D), Q-Clubs.\n\nI am going to discard cards 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nWait, the Queen of Hearts is debuffed. Should I keep it? It's 40 chips with the Queen of Clubs. But discarding it gives us a better chance with the 4 discards. I have 4 discards, discard it.\n\nFinal decision. I am going to discard 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nOkay, let's make the call. The schema requires \"action\" and \"positions\". Action: `discard`. Positions: [4, 5, 6, 7]. Discarding it is.\n\n\n"
