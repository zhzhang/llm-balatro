{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Prioritizing High Card Level for \"The Eye\"**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 7, Round 16, and we're headed towards \"The Eye\" boss blind. Right now, I've got $49, and I'm running a High Card-focused build. My current Jokers are Smiley Face (+5 Mult), Photograph (X2 first face card), Hanging Chad (Retrigger), Stuntman (+250 chips, +10 mult), and Pareidolia (all cards are face cards). I also have \"The World\" consumable, which is key. The current shop has some cards, including an Ancient Joker (Spade suit gives X1.5 Mult) and a few planet cards but nothing that will help me immediately.\n\nThe Ancient Joker is intriguing. X1.5 multiplier, potentially huge with Hanging Chad doubling it, making it essentially a X3.375 multiplier. However, it changes suit every round. My immediate thought is to use \"The World\" (which converts to Spades) when it becomes Spades. It's powerful, but it's *inconsistent*. I can't build my entire strategy on it. And, I *need* Pareidolia, or I won't have the engine for my core Photograph/Smiley Face/Chad combo to work. Buying Ancient Joker means selling one of my current Jokers, and I'm not ready to ditch Pareidolia or Smiley Face yet. Smiley Face with Chad is +15 mult, which is probably better than the random Ancient Joker multiplier *right now*.\n\nThe current hand level for High Card is 4. I should be getting Celestial Packs. The goal is to level up my hands so I can overcome \"The Eye\". I need flexibility for non-repeating hands. The shop isn't offering what I need, so rerolling the shop is the best move. It costs $10, which leaves me with $39 and an increasing cost on the next reroll. My priority is finding those Celestial Packs. I *have* the Telesope Voucher. I have no other options.\n\nAfter a quick mental inventory of the shop cards, I'm sticking to the plan: focus on leveling up High Card. I'll reroll and keep an eye out for those Celestial Packs, ideally, with some Pluto cards. The Boss is \"The Eye\". I can't repeat hands. I need to get High Card, Pair, and potentially one other hand strong enough to beat the Blind, which means I'll need to upgrade my hands significantly. So, back to the grind! Reroll the shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
