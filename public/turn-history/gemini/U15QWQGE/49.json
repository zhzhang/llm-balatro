{"reasoning":"**Strategic Pack Selection: Optimizing for Queen of Hearts**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in Ante 3, Round 4, Big Blind. Sitting on $49, which is decent, but we can't be too cavalier. I've got a spectral pack open and my current hand is decent, but it can be improved. Right now, I'm thinking about the Queen of Hearts.\n\nI've got a solid Joker setup: Gift Card (Holo), Mail-In Rebate (Foil), Trading Card, Photograph, and Hanging Chad. Each has its role, but the Queen of Hearts is the key play. The Photograph and Hanging Chad synergy with it is *strong*.\n\nThe current pack choices are Aura (Foil/Holo/Polychrome) and Wraith (random Rare Joker, which I *definitely* don't need right now). Losing all that money for a random Joker? Forget about it, especially at this stage of the game.\n\nAura is the clear winner here. My immediate thought is to enhance the Queen of Hearts, the first card in my hand, as that is the face card that will score on the first play. Given that the face card will trigger the Photograph and Hanging Chad, a good edition here is going to make it absolutely explode.\n\nA Polychrome edition would be the best for the x1.5 mult (three times), holographic is another +10 mult (three times), and foil is another +50 chips (three times).\n\nMy instinct is to go with Aura on the Queen of Hearts. It should triple the mult value. The ideal target is to have it Polychrome, but Holographic is good too! It would provide a great return.\n\nAfter running through the Joker sequencing, it's clear the best order is already set. Photograph is a \"when scored\" Joker, meaning the Queen's base score triggers it. It's the first card played in the hand so that will trigger the x2 multiplier on the first scored value (plus on the retriggers from Hanging Chad).\n\nWith that strategy, my action is: `select` with positions `[1, 1]` for `[pack_choice, hand_card]`. The command, confirmed and valid, is: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1, 1]}`. That should do the trick. The Queen is going to be a powerhouse!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1]"}
