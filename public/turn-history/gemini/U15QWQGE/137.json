{"reasoning":"**Ante Up: Strategic Joker Play**\n\nOkay, here's the play: Ante 6, Round 12. I've got $34. The Joker setup I'm running (Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia) is *perfect* for a High Card strategy. Pareidolia makes all cards face cards, which synergizes perfectly with the rest.\n\nI'm thinking through the ideal Joker order to maximize the synergies. Initially, I was thinking about the order of Photograph and Hanging Chad, but position doesn't matter for the card triggers themselves - their positions are there to get flat multipliers before multiplicative ones.\n\nMy current mental sequence is: Smiley Face (+5 mult), Photograph (X2 mult), Hanging Chad (Retrigger), Stuntman (+250 chips, +10 mult), and Pareidolia (all face).\n\nDuring the High Card, the first card played is going to have some crazy scoring with the Chads. Okay, Chad triggers my first card twice, so that's the base score, Smiley Face (+5), and Photograph (X2) *three* times. The Photograph triggers off the retriggers from Hanging Chad. Then there's Stuntman (+10 mult). I'm seeing a huge score here.\n\nConsidering the shop, Saturn (Straight upgrade) is useless to me. The Lovers (Wild) isn't needed with this setup. Swashbuckler (+23 mult) is garbage compared to what I already have. Chaos the Clown (reroll) isn't necessary. The Blank Voucher is my target. With that, I can grab Antimatter for another Joker slot.\n\nMy main goal: Blank Voucher. That's $10, which will leave me with $24. The interest cap is at $25. Should I try to sell a consumable to hit $25 for that extra interest? Nah, selling a card for $1 to hit the cap means I'm trading the card for $1, which is a wash. I can use the consumables.\n\nI'm estimating a score of around 85,000 based on my last round's performance. High Card Level 3 with an Ace = 261 chips * 154 mult = ~40k. However, the last score was 85k. This should be much higher. I'm going with 85,000 for the estimate.\n\nAction: Buy voucher. Position: 1 (Blank Voucher). Intended Hand: High Card. Estimated Chips: 85000.\n\nI've got to make sure the JSON format is right, so I'm double-checking the schema. Need to be precise, no comments, no extra characters.\n\nOkay, everything looks good. I'm ready to buy that voucher.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
