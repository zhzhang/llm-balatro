{"reasoning":"**Let's Execute the Death Card Play**\n\nOkay, I'm in the `TAROT_PACK` state and ready to execute this play. My goal is clear: I want to duplicate that high-value Red Seal 9 of Spades. I have the \"Death\" tarot card from the \"Jumbo Arcana Pack\" available. The \"Death\" card's ability is what I need: it allows me to convert one card into another, and I've carefully set up my hand.\n\nI've already rearranged my hand perfectly in the previous turn. Currently my hand contains: a 2 of Diamonds (position 1), the Red Seal 9 of Spades (position 2 - the target to copy!), and other cards that aren't important right now. I've got the \"Death\" card at position 5 in the booster pack. The game state tells me the current hand, and the target card.\n\nThe \"Death\" card's description confirms my strategy: \"Select 2 cards, convert the left card into the right card (Drag to rearrange)\".  I want to make the 2 of Diamonds become the Red Seal 9 of Spades. So, the first hand position will be 1 (2 of Diamonds) and the second hand position will be 2 (Red Seal 9 of Spades).\n\nTherefore, my action will be to `select` the \"Death\" card, choosing pack card position 5, and the hand positions 1 and 2 to convert the card at position 1 to the card at position 2. So the command is `select 5 1 2`.\n\nI'll quickly verify these positions, just to be sure... yep. Pack Choices: `1: The Star, 2: The Hermit, 3: The Chariot, 4: The Hanged Man, 5: Death`. Hand after previous `rearrange_hand 6 1 2 3 4 5`: confirms the hand order. So `select 5 1 2` is definitely correct.\n\nNow, let's consider the score. The Jokers I have are: Smiley Face (1), Photograph (2), Hanging Chad (3), Stuntman (4), and Pareidolia (5). My Red Seal 9 of Spades is a face card (thanks to Pareidolia), so if I make this the first card played, it'll be amazing! The Red Seal effect retriggers a card's ability, and combined with Hanging Chad (retriggering the first played card twice), and Smiley Face (+5 mult per face card) and Photograph (x2 mult on first played face card), I'll be maximizing the 9 of Spades' triggers.\n\nIf the 9 of Spades is the first card played, I'll have 1 (base) + 2 (Chad) + 1 (Red Seal) = 4 triggers. And Photograph *should* trigger for each of those scoring events, given that it's the first face card.  I'm confident this is the strongest play available to me right now.\n\nMy final output, in JSON format, confirms all these thoughts and considerations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [5, 1, 2],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5,1,2]"}
