My goal is 1200 chips, and I'm currently at 0, needing to clear the hurdle this round. I've got a $14 bankroll and four hands.\\n\\nMy current hand is: Jack of Spades, 4 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 9 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, King of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds. I already discarded one card using the \\\"Trading Card\\\" joker.\\n\\nI've got a couple of pairs \\u2013 Jacks (1,4) and 2s (3,6,8) and a potential Three of a Kind of 2s which is a solid base. My jokers are: \\\"Gift Card\\\" (Holo) that provides a +10 mult and adds $1 sell value and \\\"Mail-In Rebate\\\" (Foil) giving a +50 Chips and a $5 per discarded Ace benefit, and I want to leverage that.\\n\\nBased on current chips and mult:\\n*   Three of a Kind (2s):\\n*   Chips: 86.\\n*   Mult: 13.\\n*   Calculation: 86 \\\\* 13 = 1118.\\n*   Observation: 1118 is just short of the 1200 goal.\\n\\n*   Pair of Jacks:\\n*   Chips: 94.\\n*   Mult: 12.\\n*   Calculation: 94 \\\\* 12 = 1128.\\n*   Observation: Still short of 1200.\\n\\nI need to make the most of my remaining three discards. My strategy is to aggressively discard \\\"junk\\\" cards \\u2013 the 4 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, King of Diamonds, and maybe one Jack \\u2013 hoping to snag Aces to trigger the \\\"Mail-In Rebate\\\" joker.\\n\\nLet's check the score of a simple Pair of Jacks again with another card.\\n*   Pair of Jacks (1, 4) + King (7).\\n*   Chips: 80. Mult: 12. 80 \\\\* 12 = 960.\\n\\nNow, if I play Three of a Kind (2s), the current calculation of 1118 means I am only 82 chips short, which I could get with a High Card.\\n\\nNow, considering the remaining deck: 3 Aces left, 3 Kings left, 4 Queens left, and 4 Tens left.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to discard: the 4, 9, King and one Jack (pos 1, 4, 7, 2, 5) to maximize my chances of pulling Aces, I'm holding onto the 2s, to at least form a Three of a Kind.\\n\\nBased on everything I have, I choose the action: discard positions `[1, 2, 4, 5, 7]`\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 4 5 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 17]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Gift Card.

I'm in round 2 with a Big Blind, staring down a chip deficit of 1200. I have $14 and 4 hands to go. I have a Gift Card for +10 mult and Mail-In Rebate for +50 chips and $5 per discarded Ace. I also have a Trading Card (used). My hand currently consists of a Three of a Kind with the 2s, but it won't get me the score I need.\\n\\nMy immediate thought is the Mail-In Rebate. I have an Ace of Clubs. I have 2 discards remaining. I can discard the Ace for an instant $5 boost.  The calculation of the Three of a Kind with the cards I have would leave me at 1118, short of my 1200 goal.\\n\\nTherefore, the smart play here is clear. I will discard the Ace, along with some other junk cards (3, Jack, 9, 6). This is the right play to get as close to the target as possible, as well as build bankroll.\\n\\nThe Action will be to Discard Positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, with the Ace being in Position 5. This gets me $5. This leaves the 2s to be used in the hand. The main goal is now to try to get 1 or 2 more Aces. I'm going to discard and hope to dig into the deck for better cards, or maybe even another Ace!\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 5 6\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 18]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Gift Card.

My target is 1200 chips, and I'm currently at $19. I've got a couple of Jokers in play: the Gift Card for +10 Mult, and the Mail-In Rebate, which is a big deal \\u2013 +50 Chips and $5 per discarded Ace. I've also already used the Trading Card this round.\\n\\nMy hand is Ace(S), King(S), 7(S), King(H), 2(H), 2(C), Jack(D), 2(D). That's interesting\\u2026 I can make either a Three of a Kind with the 2s or a Full House with the 2s and Kings.\\n\\nLet's do the math:\\n\\n*   **Three of a Kind (2s):** Base 30 Chips, 3 Mult. Adding the Mail-In Rebate and Gift Card brings it to (30 + 50 + 6) = 86 Chips and (3 + 10) = 13 Mult. So, the score is 86 * 13 = 1118. Close, but not enough to reach my target of 1200.\\n*   **Full House:** Base 40 Chips, 4 Mult. The Jokers give me (40 + 50 + 26) = 116 Chips and (4 + 10) = 14 Mult. That's 116 * 14 = 1624. That's *definitely* over 1200!\\n\\nOkay, so the Full House is the play. I have one discard left, and I also have an Ace in my hand. Crucially, the Mail-In Rebate is giving me $5 for each discarded Ace. That's a no-brainer. I'll discard the Ace (pos 1), some junk (pos 3 and pos 7), and then play the Full House with my remaining cards.\\n\\nSo, the optimal discard looks like this: discard the Ace of Spades (Pos 1) for the money, and the 7 of Spades (Pos 3) and the Jack of Diamonds (Pos 7). That leaves me with the Full House of 2s and Kings (positions 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8). That way, I'll get $5 for the discarded Ace and still have the Full House to get over my target score. The prompt states the action to use should be \\\"discard\\\", and my positions are [1, 3, 7].\\n\\nJust to double-check, I'll review the Mail-In Rebate. Yes, it still gives me $5 for discarded Aces.\\n\\nOkay, let's make sure I didn't miss anything. The prompt states to `discard <card1> <card2> ... <card5>`, so I'm discarding positions [1, 3, 7]. Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nLet's confirm the Full House scoring one last time. It's: Base Chips = 40, Base Mult = 4, Joker Chips = +50, Joker Mult = +10, Card Chips = 10 + 10 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 26. Total Chips = 40 + 50 + 26 = 116, and Total Mult = 4 + 10 = 14. So, the Score is 116 * 14 = 1624. Perfect.\\n\\n**Action:** discard 1 3 7.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 3 7\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Gift Card.

  "reasoning": "**Analysis: Optimal Play for Maximum Score**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: 1200 chips are needed to win this round, and I've got a shot. I'm starting at zero chips, but I have four hands remaining. The hand I have is looking pretty good. I have a Gift Card (Holo), a Mail-In Rebate (Foil), and a Trading Card. The cards in my hand look like: King of Spades, King of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 2 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds.\n\nImmediately, I see potential for a Full House. The kings and the 2s jump out at me. I've got two Kings and three 2s, perfectly suited. Let me confirm that this will be the best play.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scoring. A Level 1 Full House has a base of 40 chips and a multiplier of 4. Now, for the cards: King (10) + King (10) + 2 (2) + 2 (2) + 2 (2) = 26 chips. The Mail-In Rebate (Foil) adds 50 chips, and the Gift Card (Holo) adds +10 to the multiplier. That gives me a total of (40 + 26 + 50) chips and (4 + 10) multiplier. Now, do the math: 116 chips * 14 multiplier = 1624.\n\nWait, let me double check the order of operations. Yup, that's it: the card values, then the Rebate, then the multiplier from the Gift Card. So, 1624 is the final score. \n\nThe description of \"Mail-In Rebate\" says \"+50 chips,\" and the description of \"Gift Card\" says \"+10 Mult.\" Foil means +50, Holo means +10. Yes, and yes. \"Trading Card\" just exists and is in the inventory.\n\nThe math checks out. I'm going to score well over the target of 1200, it's a guaranteed win, and I still have 3 hands to go, so no reason to play anything else. If I win, I should earn about $36 plus some extra value in the Gift Card, plus interest on my cash. It should increase the sell value of my jokers (which is $10 right now). With the Gift Card, that gets bumped to $13.\n\nOkay, positions confirmed: 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8. That will be a Full House: Kings full of 2s. Now, it's time to build the command.\n\n\n"
