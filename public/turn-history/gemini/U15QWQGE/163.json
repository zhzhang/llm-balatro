{"reasoning":"**Analyzing a Suboptimal Booster Choice**\n\nOkay, Ante 7/8, Round 15. The game step is SPECTRAL_PACK, triggered from skipping the Small Blind for that Ethereal Tag. My Joker setup is pretty solid: Smiley Face for the face card multiplier, Photograph doubling the first face card, Hanging Chad to retrigger, Stuntman for a Holo Multiplier and Chip boost, and Pareidolia, which makes everything a face card. I also have The World consumable, which can convert three cards to Spades, just in case. My current hand is 6H, 4H, KD, JD, 10D, 4D. I'm sitting on $24.\n\nNow for the Pack Choices: I'm faced with Hex and Ouija. Immediately, my expertise screams \"RUN KILLER!\" about *Hex*. It offers to add Polychrome, but at the cost of destroying all other Jokers. Absolutely not. I have a critical engine running. Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman and Pareidolia together are crucial for this High Card build. Wiping out the foundation for a small Polychrome multiplier is a terrible trade.\n\n*Ouija* is equally unappealing. It converts the hand to a random rank and reduces hand size by one. I'm already down to six cards in hand thanks to Stuntman, and I don't want to make things worse. While the random rank is somewhat irrelevant because Pareidolia makes everything a face card anyway, reducing the hand size is a huge drawback. It reduces consistency for finding the \"good\" cards (like the Gold card I made last turn or Red Seals).\n\nSo, both are detrimental. *Hex* is a build-breaker. *Ouija* restricts hand size with little benefit. *Skipping* is the obvious play here.\n\nLet's do some sanity checks. Is there a scenario where Hex is remotely worth it? If it hits Stuntman, I get a x1.5 multiplier, but I lose the x2 from Photograph and the +5 mult from Smiley Face. To check this let's examine the scoring possibilities.\n\nBase High Card (Lvl 4) has 35 Chips, 4 Mult.\nStuntman with Polychrome has +250 Chips, +10 Mult, and the Polychrome is at x1.5.\nSo, the score would be (35+250) * (4+10) * 1.5 = 5,985 chips.\nThis is against my current estimated score of 60,000+ chips.\nSo, Hex is a big NO.\n\nWhat about Ouija? The hand size reduction is permanent. The random rank is useless, and it reduces consistency for finding the \"good\" cards. It's a significant penalty.\n\nConclusion: Skip the booster. It's the safest and best play. `skip_booster` is the command.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
