{"reasoning":"**The Calculated Gambit**\n\nOkay, Ante 7, Round 16, pre-boss. I've got $25 and am facing \"The Eye,\" which means no repeating hand types. My current Jokers are Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. Plus, I have \"The World,\" which can be situationally useful. I've got a High Card build. Pareidolia makes all cards face cards, which triggers Hanging Chad, which means my Photograph card (which doubles the face card), will retrigger. Smiley Face will get +5 mult 3 times. Stuntman gives a ton of chips and mult. My base score on a High Card is estimated at 70,800.\n\nI'm eyeing the shop: Neptune is useless for me, but Swashbuckler gives +23 Mult based on joker sell value. Crazy and Sly Jokers aren't worth it. Is Swashbuckler worth replacing Smiley Face? Well, Swashbuckler is *slightly* better, but it will drop my cash below the optimal $25 to accrue interest.\n\nThe obvious play is to save money, since the shop is underwhelming, and prep for \"The Eye.\" I need to beat the boss with non-repeating hands. High Card, Pair, and maybe Two Pair are my options. Since I'm doing 70k per High Card, I might need 2-3 hands, but the shop isn't worth a reroll. I'm going to save my money.\n\nRe-evaluating the Joker order, I need to make sure I am getting the maximum benefit from retriggering. Smiley Face (Mult) *must* come before Photograph (X Mult). Otherwise, it becomes an awful return on my resources. With this order, my estimated Mult will be 120. Photograph + Chad + Smiley (20, 3 times = 60). I'm still debating on Swashbuckler: worth it or not worth it? It would be +6 Mult for $4. I'd be at 23, losing $1 in interest. But, since the boss is \"The Eye,\" a more controlled approach may be best.\n\nGiven the non-repeating hand requirement, I'm confident I can win \"The Eye.\" If I use High Card followed by Pair, that's ~137k. Given the previous Big Blind was 54,000, 137k is more than enough for the boss.\n\nAll signs point to `round_select`. It's time.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
