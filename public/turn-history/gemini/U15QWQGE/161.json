{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy Evaluation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 7, Round 15. I'm in the SHOP step with $24. My core strategy relies on the Pareidolia joker turning everything into Face cards for High Card plays, which has been consistently strong. I'm running a joker setup that focuses on massive chip generation from a single card play: Stuntman (+250 chips, +10 mult, holo edition), Smiley Face (+5 mult on score), Photograph (x2 mult on the first card), and Hanging Chad (retrigger first card x2).\n\nMy rough estimate shows this build is capable of a massive score, around 66k chips per High Card, and my recent hands confirm this scoring potential.\n\nThe shop offers are: Saturn, Egg, a Joker with +4 Mult, and Splash. None of these align with my strategy. Saturn levels straights, useless. Egg is too late-game to be worth it. The Joker is worse than any of my current jokers. Splash has no impact on a High Card build.\n\nI am sitting on 5/5 jokers, 1/2 consumables, and $24. The reroll cost is $5, and I am close to the $25 interest cap. I have \"The World,\" which converts cards to Spades.\n\nI'm confident I can beat Ante 7 as-is. There are no upgrades in this shop, so I should be looking to advance to Ante 8.\n\nNow, let's confirm the joker ordering for maximum efficiency. My current arrangement is: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman. After a quick review of the rules, it's clear the order matters. The plan is:\n1.  Base Chips + Stuntman (250).\n2.  First card scores:\n    *   Smiley (+5)\n    *   Photograph (x2)\n    *   Chad Retrigger 1:\n        *   Smiley (+5)\n        *   Photograph (x2)\n    *   Chad Retrigger 2:\n        *   Smiley (+5)\n        *   Photograph (x2)\n3.  Independent Jokers:\n    *   Stuntman Holo (+10 Mult).\n\nPhotograph's X2 effect must trigger during the score calculation to maximize its effect with the Smiley and Chad retriggers.\n\nI *could* sell \"The World\" for $1, hitting the $25 interest cap. However, it's not strictly necessary. It converts cards to Spades, but I don't have a Spades-focused build, and I do have a Red Seal card. However, the interest is important.\n\nBased on the previous turn, I'm going to proceed to the next blind.\n\n*Correction*: No other shop items, so, I will move to the next round.\nAction: `round_select`\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
