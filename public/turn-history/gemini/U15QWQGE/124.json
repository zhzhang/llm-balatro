{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Arcana Pack: The Hermit's Value**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the `TAROT_PACK` phase with $25 in the bank. I've got a decent hand, but more importantly, I'm playing High Card. My Jokers are perfectly optimized: Smiley Face (1), Photograph (2), Hanging Chad (3), Stuntman (4), and Pareidolia (5). This setup means every card becomes a face card, giving me some powerful triggers.\n\nI'm staring at three Arcana pack choices: The Devil, The Hermit, and Death.\n\nThe Devil seems okay. $3 per round, but I can do better.\n\nDeath offers the chance to copy my best card, the 8 of Spades (Holo, +10 Mult). While more Holo cards are beneficial, I'm only playing a single card each round anyway. My discard lets me find it if necessary. With Pareidolia, every card is already a face card, so that's helpful. This option has potential, but I'm leaning toward...\n\nThe Hermit. This is where it's at. This doubles my money up to $20, which is exactly what I need. Given my starting $25, this brings me to a healthy $45. My interest is capped at $5 given my current balance, so this gives me a lot of room for shop purchases and rerolls. With The Hermit, the best economic play is a given. That's the best option here, for me.\n\nMy command is `select 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
