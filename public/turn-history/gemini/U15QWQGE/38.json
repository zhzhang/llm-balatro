{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase of Ante 3, Round 3, with $41 in my pocket. Let's take stock. I've got a decent Joker suite going: Gift Card for that sweet mult and sell value, Mail-In Rebate is a chip engine, Trading Card is card removal, and Photograph is that first face card multiplier. Justice is sitting there, ready to be Glass enhanced. I'm running Overstock on vouchers. My hand is a Flush Level 4, so that's what I am working toward.\n\nSuperposition in the shop is useless for me, I'm not doing Straights with Aces, so I can ignore that. I have $41, and I have one open Joker slot.\n\nI can't use Justice right now since I can't target a card. Buying Superposition is a no-go at $4. I have enough money to reroll the shop ($5), leaving me with $36 which is ideal because I can search for a 5th Joker. I can also just go to the next round if nothing changes.\n\nGiven the goal of optimizing scoring for Ante 3 and beyond, and that empty Joker slot is screaming for a solid addition, rerolling the shop is the most logical and high-priority move here. It's the best way to significantly improve the build with a potential scaling Joker or more mult/chips.\n\nThe `reroll_shop` command is a straightforward action that doesn't require any arguments. So, let's do it: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
