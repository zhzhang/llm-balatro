{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment: Ante 5/8, Round 10**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in Ante 5, Round 10. The game step is the SHOP. I've got $25, which is perfect for maximizing interest. The goal is to crush the upcoming Big Blind, which is a measly 16,500 chips.  My current setup is already hitting well beyond that. Let's see what the shop has.\n\nI have a killer Joker setup already: Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Photograph (X2 Mult for the first played face card), Hanging Chad (Retrigger first played card twice), Stuntman (+250 Chips, +10 Holo Mult, -2 hand size), and Pareidolia (all cards are face cards).  Also, Justice is in my inventory, so I can enhance a card to Glass if I need to.\n\nThe shop itself offers: Saturn (Straight lvl up) for $3, The Lovers (Wild card) for $3, Strength (Increase rank) for $3, and Half Joker (+20 Mult if hand size <= 3) for $5.  The reroll cost is $5.\n\nMy strategy is centered around High Card. Pareidolia makes every card a face card. Hanging Chad will retrigger that first card twice, meaning it will trigger 3 times total. Photograph gives that x2 multiplier on that first face card for each of the 3 triggers. Smiley Face gives +5 Mult on each of those retriggers, and Stuntman will give me a huge flat chip bonus and the Holo Mult.  The hand size reduction is irrelevant in a High Card strategy.\n\nSaturn is pointless here, as are The Lovers, given that all cards are already \"wild\" with Pareidolia. Strength also doesn't provide significant value compared to the Stuntman's chip bonuses. Half Joker offers +20 Mult, which is enticing, but is it better than what I already have? I'm using Smiley Face, which is +5 mult per trigger and has 3 triggers (so it adds +15 Mult). The Half Joker would be +20 once. \"Independent\" Jokers activate after card triggers, so it is the last multiplier at the end. Math check: Smiley (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) * 2 * 2 * 2 = 128 Mult, before Stuntman holo.  If I swap Smiley for Half Joker it would be just 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 8, then 8 + 10 (Holo) + 20 (Half) = 38 Mult. Nope, Smiley Face is much better because its bonus is applied *before* the Photograph multipliers on each retrigger.\n\nA reroll might find something better – a scaling mult or additional retriggers or useful consumables (like Pluto for High Card).  However, I'm currently capped on money for interest, at $25. The shop cards are not helpful at all. The Big Blind is only 16,500, but I hit 51,216 on my last Small Blind. I'm already way ahead of the curve. Buying, selling, or using consumables isn't going to help here.  I could spend $5 to reroll, and lose $1 interest, and maybe find something useful... but the shop isn't that good now and I'm already crushing the required score.\n\nSo, here's my decision: I think saving the money for a future shop is the best play.  Wait, let me double-check the Joker order... the order is: Smiley, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. Trigger 1: Base mult -> Smiley Face adds +5 -> Photograph X2.  Hanging Chad retriggers that, so: Trigger 2: (Mult) -> Smiley Face adds +5 -> Photograph X2.  Trigger 3: (Mult) -> Smiley Face adds +5 -> Photograph X2.  Yeah, this sequence is ridiculously powerful.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient move is to go to the `round_select` stage. Shop items are useless, interest is maximized, and my current build is overkill for the next blind. So, action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
