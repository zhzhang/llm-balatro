{"reasoning":"**Shop Decisions: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 4, Round 6. I've got $43, five Jokers, two consumables, and a pretty solid setup overall. My current Jokers are Gift Card (Holo, +10 Mult, scales sell value), Trading Card (essential for deck thinning and $3/discard), Photograph (X2 mult on first face card), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card 2x), and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size). Consumables are Justice (Glass) and The World (Spades). I'm building towards a Spades Flush strategy.\n\nThe shop offers Neptune (Straight Flush), The Star (Diamonds – not useful), Acrobat (X3 Mult on *final* hand), and Saturn (Straight). I have Overstock and Overstock Plus vouchers.\n\nRight now, my scoring engine is locked down: Photograph and Hanging Chad give me X8 on the first face card played. Gift Card adds a flat +10 mult at the end. Stuntman is helping with the chips. I can *buy_and_use_consumable* planets like Neptune or Saturn immediately, bypassing my inventory, but that's not my priority.\n\nShould I buy Acrobat? It's tempting. X3 on the final hand is *huge* but I'm thinking long-term right now with the Gift Card. If I sell a Joker for Acrobat, which one? Trading Card is for deck thinning, Gift Card for scaling value, Stuntman for the chip bonus...selling Photograph or Chad breaks the engine. Acrobat is a conditional power spike.\n\nI'm thinking about the buy order of Jokers - Stuntman then the face cards and then the gift card. Acrobat is nice but I'd rather have the Gift Card scaling. I'm above the interest cap right now, so that's good.\n\nSo, I can't *use* Justice or The World in the shop. Neptune and Saturn don't really help my strategy. Reroll cost is $6, I have $43. So $37 after.\n\n**The Reroll Question**\n\nMy main goal is a Spades Flush. I need Spades, face cards, and Jupiter (Flush level up). Reroll is the best shot for those. I have the *Trading Card* so I am not *desperate* but want to thin the deck. I can buy and use the Planet cards immediately if I want, but I do not.\n\nThe best use of my cash is to find something to enhance my setup and find something for the Big Blind coming up.\n\nOkay, let's see. My plan is the Flush strategy and to look for Jupiter. I am going to keep going with the Gift Card and the Trading Card to maximize the rounds.\n\nThe shop again: Neptune, Star, Acrobat, Saturn. None are \"must-haves\" except maybe Acrobat but it's not worth breaking Gift Card/Trading Card.\n\nOkay, I'll reroll to look for Jupiter or a Tarot.\n\nWait, it looks like I have already rerolled the shop once, so the cost is now $6.\n\n**A Closer Look at the Engine**\n\nI have a really solid build. I need to make sure I am doing the right action. I have the Gift Card. Let's see if the Jokers work. Photograph and Hanging Chad are on the first card played: (1) scores. Photograph (X2). Chad (Retriggers). Card (Scores). Photograph (X2). Chad (Retriggers). Card (Scores). Photograph (X2). So (Base Mult * 2 * 2 * 2) + 10. No order is important.\n\n**The Decision**\n\nI have a solid engine, so *reroll_shop* seems the best option. I am looking for Jupiter, Tarot, good Jokers, or booster packs.\nSo the *reroll_shop* seems best.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
