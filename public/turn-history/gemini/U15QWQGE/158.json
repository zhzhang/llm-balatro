{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy and Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 7/8, Round 15, and I'm in the SPECTRAL_PACK game step. My Joker setup is looking *amazing*: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia – absolute dream team for high-scoring hands. I've got $28 in the bank, which I want to keep since I'm trying to gain interest.\n\nNow, the Spectral Pack gives me two choices: Aura (apply an edition to a card) or Wraith (create a Rare Joker but sets my money to $0). Wraith is a no-go; I have five Jokers already, and the cost of replacing one with a random one isn't worth it, especially considering my bankroll and current joker synergy. Aura, on the other hand, is a solid, safe improvement. Adding a Foil, Holographic, or Polychrome to a single card can be huge, especially given my Photograph and Hanging Chad combo.\n\nSo, Aura it is. The question then becomes, which card do I enhance? Let's analyze the hand: I've got a 9 of Spades with a red seal, an Ace of Clubs, a Jack of Clubs (bonus), a 2 of Clubs, a Queen of Diamonds (lucky), and a 7 of Diamonds. The Jack and Queen are interesting, but the 9 of Spades with the Red Seal really catches my eye.\n\nThe 9 of Spades is the real star here. With Hanging Chad, Photograph, and Pareidolia, this card will be incredibly valuable. Remember, with Pareidolia, every card is a face card! The Photograph will trigger on the first \"face card\" (which is now every card). The Red Seal retriggers the card once, but I'm thinking the Chad and Seal stack – so the 9 of Spades should score multiple times. This means that any edition bonus (Foil, Holo, Poly) I add will trigger multiple times. This card will be the key to my scoring engine, especially since I'm going for High Card/Pair plays with my current jokers.\n\nTherefore, the play is clear: I'm selecting Aura and applying it to my 9 of Spades. So the commands should be `select 1 1`. Looks like it's a good move.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1]"}
