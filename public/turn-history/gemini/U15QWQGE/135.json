{"reasoning":"**The Strategy is Set: Buffoon Pack First**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 6 with $38. My build is humming along nicely, focused on High Cards with Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), and Pareidolia. This setup is already hitting around 100k per High Card, well above what's needed for this Ante. So, I need to think long-term here, about scaling or deck thinning for future runs.\n\nI have a plan: first, I'm buying the Buffoon Pack. It's a low-risk, high-reward move. The current Jokers, while common/uncommon, work *perfectly* together. Smiley Face's mult triggers are massively amplified by Photograph and Hanging Chad, so I'm not tempted by Swashbuckler's flat mult. I did the math - Smiley Face's synergy is vastly superior, easily surpassing Swashbuckler's raw bonus.\n\nNext, if the Buffoon Pack doesn't have a game-changer like a rare xMult or something utility-focused like Blueprint, I'm buying the Blank Voucher. It's a long-term investment that eventually unlocks Antimatter.\n\nRight now, I also have two consumables, The World and The Hierophant. The World is useless for High Cards and The Hierophant is okay but not necessary. I'm not going to sell them yet, I'll need the space if I buy a Planet or Tarot card.\n\nSo, the action is simple. I'm going to buy the Buffoon Pack first, then the Blank Voucher.\n\n*   Current money: $38\n*   Buffoon Pack Cost: $4\n*   Remaining: $34\n*   Blank Voucher: $10\n*   Remaining: $24 (Close to the interest cap.)\n\nLet's do this.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
