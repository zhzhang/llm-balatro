{"reasoning":"**Preparing for the Final Push**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 8, the final ante. I've got $31, and this is where the rubber meets the road. My strategy is locked in: a single High Card powered by Pareidolia, amplified by the core engine of Photograph, Hanging Chad (x2), Sock and Buskin, and Stuntman.\n\nMy first thought is to ensure the multiplier math is correct and that the setup is optimized. Base is 65 Chips, 7 Mult. Stuntman gives +250 Chips, and a Holo +10 Mult. Photograph gives X2 Mult, and both Hanging Chad and Sock and Buskin are retriggers, with Hanging Chad retriggering 2 times. The expected score is a massive $85,680. I'll need to use The Chariot in the round itself to enhance one card to Steel. The World won't help, but is ok.\n\nI can't use The Chariot in the shop phase since I don't see my cards. Time to move on and select the round. I should also have enough money to reroll a bad boss blind because of my Director's Cut Voucher. I have $31.\n\nThe shop offers aren't tempting at this stage. Tarot Merchant is too late-game. Gluttonous Joker and a regular Joker are replacements. No, my setup is solid.\n\nThe next question: does the Joker order matter? After re-evaluating the scoring steps and the trigger mechanics, I'm confident the order is unimportant, as only Stuntman's Holo is an \"independent\" trigger. This will trigger at the end for an additional +10 Mult, which is what I want.\n\nA final check: Should I use this money to get any upgrades? I could reroll for Pluto. I should hold $10 in case the boss is a terrible match. I should also save in case I get a shop, but the chances are slim. Given my solid setup, I will select the `round_select` action and get ready.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
