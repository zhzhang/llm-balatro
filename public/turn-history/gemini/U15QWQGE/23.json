{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Assessment: Jupiter Reigns Supreme**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 2, Round 2, and I've got $22 in the bank. My primary objective? Maximize scoring and build towards those sweet, sweet 8 Antes. The deck is in play, the celestial pack is in front of me:\n\nI'm looking at my Joker setup: Gift Card, Mail-In Rebate, Trading Card, and Photograph. Good synergies are setting up.\n\nThe PLANET_PACK choices have arrived! The choices are: Mercury (Pair), Jupiter (Flush), or Pluto (High Card).\n\nMercury offers a decent 15 chip, 1 mult boost to pairs, bumping them to (25, 3). Pluto, a safe 10 chip, 1 mult, leading to a (15, 2) high card.\n\nMy gut is telling me flush. Jupiter offers a hefty 15 chip, 2 mult increase to flush hands, leading to a (50, 6).\n\nI remember that I used a \"Sigil\" card just a moment ago. Sigil converts all the cards in my hand to the same suit, which means Jupiter is looking real attractive right now. I should be at least a little biased towards a specific suit.\n\nI've got the Trading Card Joker, so I can start thinning the deck, making flushes more reliable over time. Photograph wants face cards in the flush for the double mult. Full House has been my go-to hand so far.\n\nWhile Pluto is reliable, I think I'm looking at a mid-game transition.\n\nI like the high scoring potential of Jupiter, especially since it gives +2 Multi. This is a game of probability and synergy. This makes Jupiter, the Flush booster, particularly strong, especially with my recent Sigil play.\n\nI've got the trading card in my hand, meaning I'll be deleting cards! A thinner deck favors the flush. The +2 Mult boost Jupiter gives is a huge difference.\n\nIf I play a flush with the King:\n*   With a King, a Level 1 Flush becomes 95 chips, 18 Mult = 1710 Chips\n*   A Level 2 Flush becomes 110 chips, 22 Mult = 2420 Chips\n\nWhile Mercury and Pluto are okay, Jupiter is the clear winner for score potential. My reasoning from the previous turn further reinforces Jupiter because the Sigil created 8 of the same suit in my deck.\n\nSo, Jupiter it is. Let's select it.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
