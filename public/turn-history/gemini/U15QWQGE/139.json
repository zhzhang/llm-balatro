{"reasoning":"**Analysis of the Small Blind: High Card Dominance**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6/8, Round 12, Small Blind, $24 in the bank. I've got a killer High Card build going, and this setup is just begging to be played. Jokers are primed: Pareidolia turns everything into face cards, Smiley Face adds +5 Mult for played face cards, Photograph doubles the Mult of the *first* face card, Hanging Chad retriggers the *first* played card twice, and Stuntman adds a nice chip and Mult boost. Plus, I have The World and The Hierophant, just in case. Vouchers are solid.\n\nThe strategy is clear – play the High Card. Level 3 High Card gives us a base of 25 chips and 3 mult. Stuntman bumps that to 275 chips and 13 mult. Let's see how the Jokers work together here. I'm playing the \"A\" as my initial card, which becomes a face card thanks to Pareidolia. Smiley and Photograph trigger, adding +5 and doubling, and Hanging Chad fires those triggers twice more.\n\nLet's do the math:  Starting with 13 Mult.  Trigger 1: (13 + 5) * 2 = 36.  Trigger 2: (36 + 5) * 2 = 82. Trigger 3: (82 + 5) * 2 = 174.  My final Mult from the Triggers is 174. So we're at 275 chips + ~10 (Ace) = 285 chips. 285 * 174 = 49,590. Nice! Easily clearing the 20,000 Small Blind and 30,000 Big Blind.\n\nNow, playing the Small Blind means I get the $3 reward, plus some unknown amount from future hands, and interest, netting me probably $10-12. Skipping it gives me the Juggle Tag, which is practically useless for this High Card build. No brainer, I'm playing the round. The money is important for the shop and interest.\n\nAction: `play_round`. Target: High Card. I'm estimating around 50,000 chips.\n\nWait, should I review my Joker order? Current: Smiley, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. Let's check the rules. The game says the *Independent* Jokers activate left-to-right, and the *on scored* Jokers (Photograph/Smiley) are triggered in inventory order for each trigger. If I have Photograph at pos 2 and Smiley at pos 1:\n1. Card scores.\n2. Smiley Face (pos 1) adds +5.\n3. Photograph (pos 2) X2. That's optimal. (Base + 5) * 2 is better than (Base * 2) + 5.\nWait, Stuntman has a +10 Mult (Holo) at the end. I should account for that. Let's make sure the Holo edition of Stuntman is activating correctly.\n\nFinal calculation review: Base: 3 Mult. Card triggers (3 times): Trigger 1: +5 (Smiley), *2 (Photo) -> (3+5)*2 = 16. Trigger 2: +5 (Smiley), *2 (Photo) -> (16+5)*2 = 42. Trigger 3: +5 (Smiley), *2 (Photo) -> (42+5)*2 = 94. Independent Jokers: Stuntman (Holo): +10 -> 94+10 = 104 Total: 104 mult. Chips: 25 (base) + 250 (Stuntman) + 11 (Ace) = 286. 286 * 104 = 29,744. Still comfortably over 20,000!\n\nThe action is `play_round`. No additional parameters needed. Time to execute!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
