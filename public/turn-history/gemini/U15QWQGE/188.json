{"reasoning":"**Strategic Crossroads: Ante 8 Optimization**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 17 of Ante 8, sitting on $44. The immediate goal? Maximize this high card build to clear this ante. We've got a killer Joker lineup: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo edition), and Pareidolia. We're running High Card at level 6, which gives us a base of 55 chips and 6 mult.\n\nI need to re-assess the situation to make the best decision for the next shop cycle. I need to make sure I am optimizing my decision.\n\nRight now, the shop has Supernova, The Star, Death, and Vagabond. There's also a Tarot Merchant Voucher, but that's not a priority for this ante. Supernova adds +10 Mult based on how many times I have played the hand, and Death can convert a card. Vagabond isn't useful for my current cash. The Star is suit conversion, which is also irrelevant for a High Card build.\n\nI am re-evaluating the chips and mult total, which I've calculated to be ~39,040 in the past. After a closer look, the correct chips count is around 60,390. This means that my calculation was off previously, I need to make sure I am doing it correct. My new calculations are:\n\n1.  Base: 55 chips, 6 mult.\n2.  Stuntman: +250 chips, +10 mult (holo). Total: 305 chips, 16 mult.\n3.  Played Card (treated as Face by Pareidolia):\n    1.  Trigger 1 (Scoring):\n        1.  Smiley Face: +5 mult (16 + 5 = 21).\n        2.  Photograph: x2 mult (21 \\* 2 = 42).\n    2.  Trigger 2 (Chad):\n        1.  Smiley Face: +5 mult (42 + 5 = 47).\n        2.  Photograph: x2 mult (47 \\* 2 = 94).\n    3.  Trigger 3 (Chad):\n        1.  Smiley Face: +5 mult (94 + 5 = 99).\n        2.  Photograph: x2 mult (99 \\* 2 = 198).\n4.  Total Chips: 305 \\* 198 = 60,390.\n\nHowever, I made a small error, here's the correct breakdown:\n\n1.  Base Mult: 6.\n2.  Trigger 1:\n    1.  Smiley Face (+5) -> 11.\n    2.  Photograph (x2) -> 22.\n3.  Trigger 2 (Chad):\n    1.  Smiley Face (+5) -> 27.\n    2.  Photograph (x2) -> 54.\n4.  Trigger 3 (Chad):\n    1.  Smiley Face (+5) -> 59.\n    2.  Photograph (x2) -> 118.\n5.  Independent/Edition (Stuntman Holo):\n    1.  118 + 10 = 128.\n6.  Total: 305 \\* 128 = 39,040.\n\nThe Supernova is looking better, but given my current set up, Smiley Face's is worth more to my hand. This is because Smiley Face gives 70 to the multiplier because of the triggers. Supernova is a flat plus.\n\nBut the most important thing is the *Telescope* is active! Since I am working on a High Card build, that means the Celestial Packs are my primary focus. I should be rerolling until I get the Pluto, or even better, better multipliers. Since I only have a small bankroll of $44, this means I need to make sure that the $6 is worth the cost of the reroll.\n\nI can buy Death for $3, and use it to copy a card. But I do not know which card is best to copy without seeing the deck. The World is currently in inventory.\n\nSo, I should be rerolling.\n\nLet's quickly re-calculate. After the first trigger, the score is 22. After the second is 54, after the third is 118. The total multiplier is 128 after the Holo effect, and the total is 39,040. So, it checks out.\n\nOkay, so Supernova\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
