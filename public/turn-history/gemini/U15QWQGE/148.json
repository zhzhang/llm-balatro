{"reasoning":"**Strategic Deep Dive: Ante 6 Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, so the game's in Ante 6, Round 14, and the goal is to maximize the High Card score, which is now at Level 4. I've got $37, which is plenty for interest, capped at $5. My Joker setup is pretty sweet: Smiley Face for face card Mult, Photograph for the x2, Hanging Chad for retriggers (critical!), Stuntman (Holo) for chips and more Mult, and Pareidolia to make everything a face card. I also have \"The World\" and \"The Hierophant\" (consumables) on hand.\n\nCurrently, with a single high-value face card (say a 10), and the current Jokers, a single High Card is already estimated to generate upwards of 50,000 chips – easily surpassing the Boss blind's required chips, but maybe a bit too close to be comfortable, so let's get that up. I need to get 40,000 to win.\n\nThe shop has some Jokers, but none are directly useful for this build: Zany for 3-of-a-kind, Misprint (variable Mult), and Crafty for Flush. So, those are out.\n\nBuying Arcana Packs to find Strength (increase rank), Death (copy cards), or Hermit (money) are always good, so I’ll buy the first one for $4. I have $37, and the $4 purchase still leaves me with $33, well above the threshold for max interest. And I have two consumables which are just taking up space, so let's try to find upgrades.\n\nBefore I purchase, I have to re-evaluate the Joker positioning. Hanging Chad should be first to retrigger, Photograph should be 2nd to have its x2 multiplier affect the first face card. Stuntman is last so its +10 Mult is not doubled by Photograph. The ordering matters because the game applies effects in a specific sequence: card score and on-score Jokers, retriggers, and then independent Jokers, so that's Smiley (+5) then Photograph (x2). Then the retriggers from Hanging Chad. Finally, the Stuntman holos activate.\n\nOkay, now let's buy and use that first Arcana Pack, to improve my deck. It's a risk, but it has good potential. The command is `buy_booster 1`.\n\nWait, before I commit, I have to check. I have already confirmed that High Card is Level 4 and my Joker setup is optimized. My money is good.\n\nI have already double-checked that `buy_booster` is correct.\n\nI am buying the first booster for $4. Remaining money: $33.\n\nThe Arcana pack it is.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
