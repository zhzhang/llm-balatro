{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop State for Optimization**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, Round 14, in the SHOP phase. I've got $33, and the High Card hand is what I'm running with. Let's see... Jokers are Smiley Face (face card mult), Photograph (x2 first face card), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card 2 times), Stuntman (+chips and +mult), and Pareidolia (makes all cards face cards). The consumables are The World (spades), and The Hierophant (+chips). I've also got a few vouchers: Blank, Overstock, Overstock Plus, and Director's Cut. My High Card level is at 4 with 35 base chips and 4 base mult.\n\nI'm focusing on High Card, as it's been the go-to hand recently. I'm leveraging the face card synergy, and I've optimized the Joker order with Pareidolia last, to keep the face card chain consistent. I did some score calculations earlier to verify the Joker setup. Based on the score, a single card play can result in 35,280 chips.\n\nThe Magician was used to modify cards in a Tarot pack, so my deck is set, currently, and now I'm back in the SHOP.\n\nLooking at the current shop, I've got Zany, Misprint, and Crafty Jokers. None of these are better than my current setup. There's an Arcana Pack available for $4. I have enough money to buy it, as I'll still be above the interest threshold of $25.\n\nI bought one Arcana pack last turn, so it looks like buying the Arcana pack is the right choice. It helps to continue deck improvement.\n\nI've got the following in my `buy_booster` command: `positions`: `[1]`.\n\nNow, before committing, let's just make sure, shall we? Okay, the current High Card scores are ranging from 31,000 to 68,000. I'm okay with that, as I'm hitting the blind requirements. I'm hitting those Big Blinds. The next blind is a Big Blind at Ante 6, with an expected score of at least 30,000.\n\nI'm going to buy the booster.\n\nAlright, double-checking, just to make sure: `buy_booster 1`. No, I can't use The Hierophant in the SHOP, it's a Tarot card that needs cards in hand and this is the SHOP. I'm in the SHOP.\n\nAlso, I've already determined that Misprint is not as good as the Jokers I have equipped. Consistency with Smiley Face is better than a random mult boost. The same goes for the other Jokers.\n\nOkay, buying the Arcana Pack now.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
