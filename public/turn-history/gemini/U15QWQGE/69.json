{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Priorities: Stuntman and a Shop Upgrade**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase after that Jumbo Arcana Pack, and I've got $64 burning a hole in my pocket. I've got a decent hand of Jokers, some consumables, and a voucher for an extra shop slot, Overstock. My immediate concern is Stuntman, but I need to clear a slot for it. I'm torn between getting the immediate power spike of +250 chips from Stuntman and the long-term benefit of Overstock.\n\nI can sell Mail-In Rebate and get $8 for it, which means I will have enough to get Stuntman. Even with that hand size penalty, Stuntman is a huge scoring potential with Photograph and Hanging Chad combo. The current Mail-In Rebate is good, providing +50 chips, but Stuntman's +250 chips is a significant upgrade. I'm thinking, \"Is this the right play?\" and doing some quick math: If I buy Stuntman, which costs $7 and sell Mail-In Rebate, I net $1 (even though the prior thought process on turn 68 thought Stuntman's -2 hand size handicap was too risky.)\n\nThere's Overstock Plus, which gives me another shop slot, which I like because more choices are always good. I also have a Standard Pack that could give me some help. But is a +50 chip bonus better than +250?\n\nI think that because I just thinned my deck with the Hanged Man, the hand size is slightly less of an issue, making Stuntman a more viable option right now. Let's see...I'm still thinking about that +250 from Stuntman... and here are my choices, 1. Buy the Voucher, 2. Sell Mail-In Rebate, 3. Buy Stuntman.\n\nMy scoring engine with Photograph + Hanging Chad is really the core of my game, so Stuntman will boost that significantly. To get Stuntman, I need to clear a slot. I'm selling the Mail-In Rebate! The voucher can wait for now. The math is clear: the Stuntman wins over the Mail-In Rebate.\n\nOkay, let's look at it again. Is there anything else I need to do? No. I will sell the Joker at position 2, the Mail-In Rebate, to get the Stuntman. This is a game winner.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
