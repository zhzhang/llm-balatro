{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy for \"The Eye\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 7, with $36 in the bank and facing the \"The Eye\" boss blind next, which means no repeating hand types. My current setup is built around a strong High Card with a potential for a secondary hand in a pinch. I've got a killer Joker combo: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman, plus Pareidolia for all face cards. A Single High Card with this setup *usually* clears easily, but I need a backup. I've got a level 5 Flush and a level 3 Pair to fall back on, but ideally I want to get that Pluto card and a Celestial Pack to make my High Card even stronger. I also have \"The World\" which I can convert 3 cards to Spades if I need to.\n\nThis current shop is a dud. \"The Star\" is useless, \"Scary Face\" isn't worth selling a Joker, and \"To Do List\" isn't worth the slot.  The reroll is $11. I *was* going to just head to the round select, but then I remember I can reroll and still maintain max interest (at $25). So, I'll reroll to look for Pluto or a Celestial Pack. A Celestial Pack is really what I need here, since it guarantees Pluto.\n\nThe Joker order is something I'm always thinking about. It's: Chad, Photograph, Smiley, Stuntman. First card plays, then Photograph x2, then Smiley triggers, then Hanging Chad triggers everything twice more. Then, Stuntman kicks in for the chips and mult. My calculations put the High Card score around 36,000, but I seem to be consistently getting more. Perhaps there are some hidden factors in the cards I'm using or I'm miscalculating some aspects of the Jokers? Doesn't matter, it's plenty to clear most things.\n\nI'm thinking: the best next step is to reroll the shop. This is because I'm in the shop *before* the boss, so I don't want to use Director's Cut just yet. It is the best way to get me to a round I can beat. I could spend a lot of money now. Rerolling means I maintain the $25 interest, and I can grab the important Pluto. It's the best next move.\n\nSo, here's the final plan.\n\n*   **Goal:** Optimize scaling for \"The Eye\" boss (non-repeating hand types).\n*   **Current Action:** `reroll_shop`.\n*   **Reasoning:** Shop is currently useless. One reroll is affordable and keeps interest at max ($5). The reroll gives me a chance to find Pluto or Celestial Packs to further scale my hands.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
