{"reasoning":"**My Current Assessment of the Shop**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Round 17, Ante 8, and I'm sitting on $38. My primary goal is to crush that Ante 8 boss. Looking at my Jokers, I've got a solid engine: Smiley Face adds a flat +5 mult to face cards, Photograph doubles the mult of the first face card played, Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card twice, Stuntman provides a nice chip boost (+250) and holo mult (+10) but reduces hand size by 2 (which is painful), and Pareidolia makes *all* my cards face cards which is key. My hand right now is just a High Card, but that's fine for now, especially with Pareidolia.\n\nMy base is looking pretty good: 305 chips and 16 mult, before my triggers kick in. The core loop is: Play a face card, Smiley kicks in for +5, Photograph doubles, and Hanging Chad repeats that twice. Let's see... base score, add smiley (21), Photograph (42), Chad for a total of 94, Chad for a total of 198. (I made a mistake in previous calculations). Stuntman brings in an extra +10. Total mult = 208. That gives me 63,440.\n\nThe shop offers are interesting, but not worth it. Burglar gives me +3 hands, at the cost of the cards I discard, which would be good for pushing, but is it *really* a priority right now? Shoot the Moon gives me +13 mult for each Queen I hold. But, Pareidolia only makes cards *count* as face cards, not Queens. So, Shoot the Moon is irrelevant. Bull offers +2 chips per dollar, which is tempting but not a game-changer. Mad Joker would add a flat +10 mult for Two Pair, but I'm playing High Card. My inventory is *The World*, which converts Spades, which is helpful. And I've got Telescope, which guarantees Pluto in Celestial Packs.\n\nSo, I have to sell one of my jokers to buy anything. Smiley Face is contributing +15 mult total (effectively, and scaling by x8 from Photograph). Photograph is x8 mult. Chad is the core engine, which is x8 mult and triggers any effects \"when scored\". Stuntman provides the chip base. Pareidolia makes the whole thing work. There's no way I can sell any of these unless I find something significantly better.\n\nBurglar could give more hands, and might make the difference between beating the blind, but it won't help the scores. Shoot the Moon is irrelevant, I only play High Card, and Bull is not a game changer. I have $38, and a reroll costs $7. I'm ideally looking for Planet Packs, Pluto (to get those Steel cards), or a better X-mult Joker (Duo, Trio, etc.), or a Red Seal. It's not worth selling any of my Jokers unless something truly amazing appears.\n\nI really need to double check the interaction between *Shoot the Moon* and *Pareidolia*. Pareidolia makes all cards count as face cards, but it doesn't make them Queens. The card text says it gives +13 for each Queen \"held in hand\".\n\nLet's quickly re-check Burglar. If I sell Smiley Face, that gives me... 305 * 198 = 60,390, minus Smiley, gives me 305 * 138 = 42,090 which is not enough to get by. So Burglar is not good enough to compensate for the loss of Smiley.\n\nOk, so it is 63,440. If I can get to around 200k in the boss stage, I should be fine, and I can probably get to that in 2-5 hands. More hands is not needed *yet*.\n\nI think it's worth the reroll. Nothing is worth selling one of my good Jokers. Reroll!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
