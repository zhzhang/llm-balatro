{"reasoning":"**Current Optimization Thoughts**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 8, final ante, Shop phase. Time to really dig in and see how I can maximize this build. I'm sitting on $49. The core strategy is clear: high card with Pareidolia turning every card into a face card, Hanging Chad re-triggering it twice, Smiley Face adding +5 Mult each hit, and Photograph doubling the Mult from that first face card. Stuntman is providing a nice chip and holo mult boost.\n\nI ran the numbers: my base High Card is level 6, giving me 55 Chips and 6 Mult. With the current setup, here's the breakdown.\n\n*   1st trigger: (Base Mult 6 + Smiley 5) \\* Photograph 2 = 22.\n*   2nd trigger (Chad): (22 + 5) \\* 2 = 54.\n*   3rd trigger (Chad): (54 + 5) \\* 2 = 118.\n*   Finally, add Holo Mult: 118 + 10 = 128.\n*   Chips: Base 55 + Stuntman 250 = 305.\n*   Estimated: 305 \\* 128 = 39,040.\n\nThat should be the base.\n\nBut 39,040 isn't nearly enough to clear this Ante. I'm going to need more power. I really need to either increase my hand level, or to find more Mult.\n\nLooking at the Shop, Ice Cream is tempting for the flat chip bonus, Midas Mask and The Magician are useless, Sly Joker is out (High Card). Tarot Merchant is fine, but doesn't immediately help. I have an inventory slot for The World, which is a Spade conversion, but that's a holdover for now.\n\nConsidering my limited funds and the need for significant improvement, I need to focus. I'm thinking about Blue or Red Seals, Steel Cards, better Jokers, Planet Packs (for Pluto), or Spectral Packs. My priority now is re-rolling the shop. The current shop offerings aren't critical for this build.\n\n*   Buying The Magician isn't great.\n*   Tarot Merchant is fine, but doesn't help immediate scoring.\n\nSo, re-roll it is.\n\n*   Action: `reroll_shop`.\n*   Money: $49 -> $44.\n\n*Wait*, before I do that, a final systems check. I need to make sure I haven't missed any opportunities.\n\nI should check the Joker order one last time.\nSmiley Face (on scored) vs Photograph (on scored). They trigger in sequence.\nIf Smiley is before Photograph: (Current Mult + 5) \\* 2.\nIf Photograph is before Smiley: (Current Mult \\* 2) + 5.\nClearly, Smiley before Photograph is better.\nCurrent Order: 1: Smiley, 2: Photograph. This is correct.\nHanging Chad: Retrigger first card.\nStuntman: +10 Mult (Holo edition). Editions on Jokers trigger *after* \"On Scored\" Jokers (Step 5 in rules). Correct.\n\nOkay, all set. Re-rolling the shop is the play!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
