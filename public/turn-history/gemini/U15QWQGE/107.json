{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Optimizing the High Card Build**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5, Round 9 with $44. The game step is SHOP. I've got a High Card strategy going, and my current Jokers are pretty strong: Smiley Face (additive mult on face cards), Photograph (x2 mult on the first face card), Hanging Chad (re-triggers the first played card), Stuntman (Holo edition: chips and mult), and Pareidolia (all cards are face cards). I also have Justice, but I'm saving that for a strategic card enhancement later. I’m carrying Overstock, Overstock Plus, and Director's Cut Vouchers. My High Card hand level is currently at Level 1.\n\nThe synergy here is clear: Pareidolia turns everything into a face card, Hanging Chad triggers that initial face card multiple times, Smiley Face adds mult, and Photograph then multiplies that mult. Stuntman is providing consistent chip and mult bonuses. My main goal right now is to boost that High Card level, ideally grabbing Pluto, but I'm open to finding better multiplicative or scaling Jokers, or potentially deck improvements like a Strength, Death, or Hanged Man card.\n\nLet's look at the shop cards. Uranus is useless. Clever Joker is also useless. Shoot the Moon needs actual Queens, not just face cards, so it is useless. Mystic Summit offers +15 Mult when zero discards are remaining. Not bad, but I’d prefer more consistent or scaling mult. I conclude that the shop is weak for my current build.\n\nI have $44, and the reroll cost is $5. I need to prioritize either a High Card level up (Pluto), or general utility. I need to examine the order of my current Jokers.\n\nI have to consider the scoring sequence: 1. Card chips, 2. Card mult, 3. 'On scored' Jokers (left-to-right), and 4. Retriggers. Smiley Face and Photograph are ‘on scored’ Jokers. Hanging Chad is a retrigger. After reviewing the rules, the scoring sequence clarifies the order: The first card is scored. Smiley Face adds mult. Then Photograph multiplies. Then Hanging Chad retriggers the scoring process.\n\nSo, let's break down the effect of the Jokers on a single card:\n*   First Trigger: (Base Mult + Smiley Face) \\* Photograph.\n*   Second Trigger: (Current Mult + Smiley Face) \\* Photograph.\n\nOr:\n*   Smiley Face before Photograph: (Base Mult + 5) \\* 2.\n*   Photograph before Smiley Face: Base Mult \\* 2 + 5.\n\nSmiley Face before Photograph is objectively better for the first card.\n\nWhat about Stuntman? Its chip and mult bonuses are ‘independent’ bonuses. And Stuntman is Holo, so its mult bonus is even higher. I need to be careful. Flat chip/mult Jokers that aren't \"on played/scored\" trigger in step 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct Joker order is Smiley, Photograph, Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia. That's good.\n\nGiven the weak shop, the optimal play is a shop reroll.\n\nI can't improve any of my current Jokers by swapping them with anything in the shop. I will use the `reroll_shop` command, with no arguments.\n\nShould I buy Mystic Summit before rerolling? No, since +15 Mult is conditional, and I'd rather try to find something better. It is better to use the money to reroll the shop.\n\nSo, time to reroll the shop and optimize the hand. No other actions needed.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
