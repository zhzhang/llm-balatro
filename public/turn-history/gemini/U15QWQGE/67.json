{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop - Ante 4, Round 6**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop, Ante 4, Round 6. I've got $70 and a decent setup. My main plan right now is to lean heavily on the Photograph + Hanging Chad combo for early/mid-game multiplier boosts on face cards. With a Flush (Level 4), I'm looking at a base score that I can really juice with my Jokers. I can see 12,600 as a potential score but I need more scaling. I have Justice, which is nice, but I'm primarily focused on the Jokers in my inventory.\n\nI have: Gift Card, which is great for flat multiplier and round scaling; Mail-In Rebate, which is helping with base chip output and some money; Trading Card, for economy and deck thinning; Photograph, which is my keystone right now with Hanging Chad; and, finally, Hanging Chad which is a huge multiplier. I'm maxed out on Joker slots – five out of five. To buy, I must sell.\n\nLooking at the shop, *Oops! All 6s* is tempting for probability, but that's not my priority right now. *Stuntman* is a rare joker that provides a massive +250 Chips, but with a significant -2 hand size. That's the big question mark: is the +250 worth the handicap? *Zany Joker* seems less relevant since I'm not running any Three-of-a-Kind focus.\n\nFor boosters, I've got the standard pack and the Jumbo Arcana Pack. I'm leaning toward the latter for potential immediate value from Arcana cards, as well as deck manipulation, even though it costs $6. The Overstock Plus Voucher for $10 is also appealing for the long game - always great to have another Joker slot.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n*   **Priority 1:** I need to determine if I want to purchase the Stuntman joker. That is the gamechanger. I need to know.\n*   **Priority 2:** I want to acquire a Jumbo Arcana Pack for the potential short-term value.\n*   **Priority 3:** Then, decide if I want to acquire the Overstock Plus Voucher.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'll buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack first to see if the Tarot cards it reveals sway my Stuntman decision. I have $70 now. Let's see if the Arcana cards have any immediate value (money or deck manipulation). Should I sell Mail-In Rebate? It's providing 50 chips currently, but Stuntman is +250, so that's a straight-up +200 chips per hand. The -2 hand size is the only drawback. I'm already sitting at ~13,500 chips. With the Stuntman, that would be roughly double - 31,500. This is pretty significant. Let's start with the Arcana Pack and see what happens. I should check if I want to buy \"Overstock Plus\" first? No, look at the Arcana Pack first. Time to buy.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
