{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy: Maximize Score for Boss Fight**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop after a Mega Standard Pack, Ante 4, and $51 to spend. The Boss Blind is looming. My immediate goal is to optimize my hand for maximum score, focusing on the synergy I've established: Pareidolia (all face cards), Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Photograph (X2 Mult for the first face card), and Hanging Chad (retriggers the first played card). I also have Stuntman (-2 hand size), but I'm thinking Juggler might be a good buy later to offset that for the Boss, especially since I'm going to have to play 5 cards.\n\nRight now, I'm thinking about the Red Seal Queen of Hearts, which re-triggers again. With Chad's retriggers and my Red Seal, that's a total of *four* triggers on the Queen. The math on the Mult is looking good. Chips are solid too at 265. Total will be 43,990. Easy beat for the 10,000 chip requirement.\n\nI've got a Blue Seal 10 of Diamonds, which creates a Planet card *at the end of the round* if held. I need an open consumable slot to get this Planet card. I have Justice (Glass) and The World (Suits) in my consumable slots.\n\nLooking at the Shop, I see Hallucination (Tarot chance), Ride the Bus (anti-synergy), Venus (Three of a Kind upgrade), Juggler (+1 hand size), and the Arcana Pack. I have the money, but I need to decide what to do.\n\nI have some choices. Juggler is tempting, but Stuntman is already giving me -2 and I have 6 cards, so a +1 hand size is probably not a necessity. The Arcana Pack is high value, but I need to free a slot. Justice is the better consumable. The World is useless with Pareidolia. I have $51, and the interest is capped at $25. There's plenty of money.\n\nThe Boss is \"The Psychic\" and requires 5 cards, but I need a 10 and Queen to trigger the seals. I can play the Queen, 4 junk cards, and hold the 10 to trigger the Planet at the end. I can sell \"The World\" or Justice to make room. The Arcana Pack is \"Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards to be used immediately.\" That’s smart, but is it the right move now?\n\nI've decided. The Arcana Pack seems like the best move. It's high value, and I can use it immediately without needing an open slot.\n\nBefore I commit to this plan, though, I should double-check the Shop cards. Juggler is a Joker, and Venus is a Planet card. I have 5/5 Joker slots. I need the Arcana Pack. I can always rearrange the Jokers later, after the pack.\n\nI'm ready. Let’s get that Arcana Pack. This will take care of the immediate problem of deck manipulation and help me get closer to that big score. Let's see what the Arcana Pack has for me. No, wait. Before I do, I will double check the hand size. I have 6. I need to keep one to receive the Planet card. It's a good plan. The Arcana Pack is the right call here.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
