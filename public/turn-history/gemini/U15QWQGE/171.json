{"reasoning":"**Rerolling for Celestial Packs**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 16, just before the Boss Blind. I've got $62 and my primary goal is to reach that chips threshold to advance to Ante 8. My current strategy is a High Card focus with face card synergies thanks to Pareidolia. My Jokers are Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), and Pareidolia – that's my engine. Vouchers are Director's Cut, Telescope, and Overstock Plus. My last hand was a Level 4 High Card.\n\nThe Boss Blind is \"The Eye,\" which is brutal for a High Card build since I can't repeat hand types. Thankfully, I have Director's Cut. I *can* reroll if needed, and I need to be ready.\n\nI'm in the SHOP phase. Looking at the options... *Vampire* is good, but it needs enhancements. *Campfire* offers strong scaling X-Mult, but needs selling items. *Troubadour* increases hand size, which isn't my bottleneck. *8 Ball* is too inconsistent.\n\nI *really* want more Pluto cards. I have $62 and a reroll costs $6. The current shop cards don't fit my current High Card focus. Campfire is tempting but I don't want to sell a core Joker.\n\nThe priority is Celestial Packs to fish for Pluto cards via Telescope. I should keep rerolling the shop to look for Celestial Packs or Arcana Packs.\n\nSo, should I buy Vampire or Campfire? Campfire could scale, but that means selling something. Smiley Face ($2), Photograph ($7), Hanging Chad ($5), Stuntman ($6), Pareidolia ($3) – the core combo. Stuntman is a huge chip provider. Replacing anything might weaken my immediate score. Selling Campfire would lose a core engine piece, and is risky before the Boss.\n\nSo the plan: `reroll_shop`. I'm hunting for Celestial Packs to level up High Card with Telescope. $62 is plenty to fish for at least one or two packs.\n\nI'm rerolling the shop. No efficient moves other than this one. My last hand was 71k; the Boss Blind likely requires 100k-140k. Need more levels or better cards. Rerolling the shop for Celestial Packs is the play with the highest probability to get me there. Definitely rerolling the shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
