{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase after the Big Blind, with $22 and aiming for the Ante 8 Boss. The upcoming blind will be debuff-heavy. My current Jokers are Gift Card (Holo, +10 Mult, +$1 sell), Mail-In Rebate (Foil, +50 chips, $5 per 8 discarded), Trading Card (deletes a card for $3), and Photograph (x2 Mult on first face card). I have one Joker slot open, and no consumables. A Flush is at Level 2, with a base of 50 chips and 6 mult. I see *Lusty Joker* which is +3 Mult for Hearts, a *Reroll Surplus* for $10, and a standard *Reroll* for $5 in the shop. I also have an *Investment Tag* for $25 after the Boss.\n\nThe *Lusty Joker* isn't compelling unless I'm forced into a Heart-heavy deck, and my previous actions don't have enough information to support that hypothesis. *Reroll Surplus* is good, but I need to save money for interest, which is $1 per $5. I can get $4 interest now, and given the $25 investment, I want to max that out. I am going to hold onto my money.\n\nMy current power is substantial. Based on my hand calculation, with a flush, Photograph, and Gift Card, my estimated hand score is about 4,800. This is enough to likely one-shot or two-shot the Ante 2 Boss. There is no crucial thing to buy in this shop.\n\nLet's carefully confirm the Joker interaction order: Boss, On-played Jokers, Played cards score, Held-in-hand, and Independent Jokers.\n\n*   Hand Mult (6) -> Step 3: 6 \\* 2 (Photograph) = 12.\n*   Step 5: 12 + 10 (Gift Card Holo) = 22.\n\nThe Gift Card's Holo +10 mult edition is Step 5 (Independent Jokers), which means it's applied after Photograph's multiplier. The order of the Jokers in my hand isn't super important. The relative order of Mail-In Rebate and Gift Card doesn't matter, and Trading Card doesn't care about its position. I have no reason to rearrange.\n\nSo, I'm going to proceed to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
