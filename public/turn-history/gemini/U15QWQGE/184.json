{"reasoning":"**Final Ante Prep - Pluto Selection**\n\nOkay, final ante, Ante 8. This is it. Game Step: PLANET_PACK. I've got $53, so I'm in a good position. My High Card is currently Level 5, with 45 base chips and a 5x multiplier. I've leaned heavily into High Card this run; I've played it ten times already. I've got a strong Joker lineup: Smiley Face is great for the face card scaling, Photograph will double the first one, Hanging Chad retriggers the first one (doubling that Photograph double!), Stuntman adds a huge chip boost and multiplier boost (if holo) and Pareidolia makes all cards faces, synergizing fantastically with Smiley Face and Photograph! And, the World consumable is in my back pocket. I also have the Telescope voucher, guaranteeing Pluto's appearance, so I need to make sure I use it!\n\nI've got three planets offered: Pluto, Mercury, and Venus. Given my build's focus, upgrading High Card is the most direct route to maximizing my scoring potential this round, so Pluto is the clear choice.\n\nSpecifically, I'm going to *select* Pluto, which is in position 1. This will level up my High Card to level 6. This will take it from 45 chips and a 5x multiplier to 55 chips and a 6x multiplier. This is going to be HUGE with Stuntman, Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad and Pareidolia in play, which will allow me to hit the higher targets in Ante 8.\n\nThe actual action I'm going to take is to select position 1, and the JSON will be simple: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
