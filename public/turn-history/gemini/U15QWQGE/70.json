{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Assessment: Stuntman Joker Acquisition**\n\nOkay, so the Stuntman Joker is available in the shop, and I'm ready to snag it. I cleared some space by selling the Mail-In Rebate, which was the right call given the circumstances. I have $72, and the Stuntman is a steal at $7. Let's make this happen. I need to free up a slot, and I currently have 4 Jokers: Gift Card, Trading Card, Photograph, and Hanging Chad. I can definitely make room; I'm operating at less than the 5 Joker max.\n\nThe Stuntman is in position 2 in the shop, so the buy action is `buy_card 2`. This Joker will give me a nice chip boost of +250, but I'll need to remember the -2 hand size. I can work with that; I usually can. After I buy the Stuntman, I'll review the shop again, but for now, the purchase is the highest priority. I'll consider if the Overstock Plus voucher or the Standard pack are worthwhile, but I'll make that decision after the Stuntman is secured. Buying the Stuntman is the action.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
