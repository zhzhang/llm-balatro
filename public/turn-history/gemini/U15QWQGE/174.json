{"reasoning":"**Current Poker Strategy: Ante 7, The Eye Boss Incoming**\n\nAlright, let's get down to business. Ante 7, and The Eye boss is looming – no repeating hand types, meaning my High Card + Face Card synergy is the play. I'm rocking a solid build with Pareidolia ensuring all face cards. My Joker setup is crucial: Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Photograph (X2 Mult for the first face card played – though I need to double-check that interaction with Hanging Chad!), Hanging Chad (Retriggers the first played card twice, crucial for multiplying my multipliers), Stuntman (Holo for +250 Chips, -1 hand size, and +10 Mult), and Pareidolia (all face cards). The World consumable is handy ($1). Director's Cut and Overstock Plus vouchers are in the inventory, along with a Telescope. I've got $66, and High Card is currently Level 4.\n\nThe shop offers are meh. Scary Face is a modest chip boost, Spare Trousers is irrelevant, Green Joker is too late to the party, and Raised Fist is weak compared to my current synergy. My priority: I need to find those Pluto cards via Celestial Packs to really push High Card levels! The Eye is the boss, so I need to be prepared. My current cash reserves are healthy; $66 is more than enough. My plan: reroll the shop.\n\nOkay, shop reroll – it's $8, leaving me with $58. That's enough for a couple of Celestial Packs or another reroll.\n\nLet's optimize my Joker order for maximum scoring. The ideal order, which is the current order, is 1: Smiley Face, 2: Photograph, 3: Hanging Chad. Why? Because I need to trigger Photograph after Smiley to double up the +5, and Hanging Chad retriggers.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Playing a single face card (thanks Pareidolia):\n\n1.  Card scores.\n2.  Chad triggers.\n3.  Card score with all triggers\n4.  Each time, Smiley Face (+5) and Photograph (X2) is applied (assuming photograph gets retriggered - this may be incorrect).\n\nDoes Joker position really matter? Yes, \"When Scored\" effects trigger from left to right. Smiley Face, then Photograph, is the correct order.\n\nSo, how does this score?\n\n*   Base: 4 Mult\n*   First card: (4 + 5) * 2 = 18 Mult.\n*   Retrigger 1: (18 + 5) * 2 = 46 Mult.\n*   Retrigger 2: (46 + 5) * 2 = 102 Mult.\n*   Stuntman Holo: +10 Mult.\n*   Total Mult: 112.\n*   Chips: Base (35) + Stuntman (250) + Card (say 10) = 295.\n*   Total: 295 \\* 112 = 33,040.\n\nThe math is a little simplified, and I’m aware of other modifiers. However, I need to get as much chip and mult as possible, as fast as possible. But that should be enough power to win. I will keep the retrigger strategy in mind. I re-checked the shop and found nothing of use.\n\nSo, let's reroll.\n**Action:** `reroll_shop`\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
