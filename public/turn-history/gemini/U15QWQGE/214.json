{"reasoning":"**Strategic Contemplations: Ante 8 Shop Phase**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 8, Shop phase, $35 in the bank. I'm running a High Card \"Photograph engine\" – Pareidolia, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Sock and Buskin, Stuntman. This build is all about maximizing multipliers through multiple Photograph triggers, and I'm acutely aware of the risk Crimson Heart poses, especially with potential Joker losses. I need to make sure this deck is ready to go to the final boss.\n\nMy initial thought is to either buy the Mega Standard Pack to see if it can improve my odds further, or go directly to the next phase. I've already determined that the other Shop items are either too specific or not impactful enough to my core strategy. A boss reroll is always a good option too. However, since the goal is to win, it's best to save the reroll option for later.\n\nI need to decide: should I reroll the boss, or just proceed to the next blind? I have $35. $10 for a reroll leaves $25, and I usually get $5 interest for a balance of $25. Therefore, it's best to proceed to the Blind Selection screen so I can assess the boss before using my Director's Cut voucher.\n\nOkay, let's do a quick calculation. High Card is Level 9, with a base of 85 chips and 9 mult, plus Stuntman (250 chips, 10 mult). With the triggers, I'm expecting roughly 100k+ score per hand with this setup. I need to beat the Boss and get past any potential Crimson Heart situations.\n\nI have The World in inventory. It's not a great card for me, and I can't think of any use for it.\n\nThe question then arises, given the risk of Crimson Heart, should I buy a Mega Standard Pack for a potential Red Seal? I need to look at my resources before I make that call. The shop is: Ancient Joker, Shoot the Moon, Fortune Teller, The Star, Mega Standard Pack, Tarot Merchant. The Jumbo Celestial Pack was used previously.\n\nThe user's prior action was to open the Jumbo pack. I'm at the very end of the game, and I'm not seeing any essential upgrades in the shop. However, I have extra money! I don't really *need* anything in the shop, but the Standard Pack could be useful.\n\nLet's look at the action again: `buy_booster 1`.\n\nThe prompt history shows a booster purchase: `buy_booster 1` (Jumbo Celestial). Now there's only 1 booster left. It is `Shop Booster 1: Mega Standard Pack`.\n\nI should just move to the boss since the deck is complete.\n\nI have $35. After a reroll, that leaves $25. Standard interest for $25 is $5. So the shop items are: Ancient Joker, Shoot the Moon, Fortune Teller, The Star, Mega Standard Pack, Tarot Merchant.\n\nI should see the boss first, since my core setup is strong. It's time for `round_select`!\n\nQuick analysis on reordering Jokers: the current setup should be optimal because Stuntman is independent and Photograph is \"on scored\", the order is fine, but I rechecked anyway. All of this checking is probably unnecessary at this point.\n\nThe next action is either to buy the booster (pack) or `round_select`. I'll `round_select`. But the most *optimal* play is to buy the Mega Standard Pack.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick to `round_select`. My setup is likely strong enough. But I will do the analysis!\n\nOne last check:\nLevel 9 High Card: 85 chips, 9 mult.\nStuntman: +250 chips, +10 mult.\nHand: 335 chips, 19 mult.\nRetriggers: Card (1) + Chad (2) + S&B (1) = 4 triggers.\nPhotograph: X2 on each trigger.\nMult: 19 * 2^4 = 304.\nTotal: 335 * 304 = 101,840.\n\nSmall Blind Ante 8: 100,000.\nBig Blind Ante 8: 150,000.\nBoss Blind Ante 8: 200,000 (usually 2x Big).\n\nWith 101k per hand, I can beat the boss in 2-3 hands. I have 4 hands.\n\nSo I am safe.\n\nThe World (1\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
