{"reasoning":"**Ante 8, Shop Phase: Pluto's My Ticket!**\n\nOkay, final ante, round 17. Time to make sure I secure that boss fight. Shop phase, money at $48. The goal is to hit the chip threshold for Ante 8, and the boss is likely to be challenging. Right now, I'm sticking with my High Card build; it's what I've been cultivating. My jokers are doing some serious heavy lifting: Smiley Face for the flat mult, Photograph for the double, Hanging Chad for the re-trigger, Stuntman for the Holo bonus, and Pareidolia converting all cards to face cards. Plus, I have 'The World' consumable in my back pocket if I need it. High Card is at level 6 with 55 chips and 6 mult.\n\nHere's the shop: Droll Joker's a dud for me (Flush? Nope). Merry Andy's out (I can't afford to lose any more hand size due to the Stuntman Joker) but Pluto… Pluto! This is the key. Pluto levels up High Card. That's *exactly* what I need. And it's only $3. I also have a Tarot Merchant voucher and a Telescope voucher, which are helpful.\n\nSo, the plan is simple: buy and use Pluto. My current bank is $48. Spending $3 on Pluto means I'll have $45 left. Pluto's *essential* for my strategy of building High Card. \n\nI know Pluto is in position 2 of the Shop Cards, so the action is `buy_and_use_consumable` with position `[2]`.\n\nMy base with the current setup is 305 chips and 16 mult. With the multipliers, the initial calculation is 305 * (5 + 10) * 2 = 63,440.\n\nNow, let's see what happens after Pluto. High Card jumps to level 7: 65 chips, 7 mult. This gives me a base of 315 chips and 17 mult. With the added multipliers, the new calculation becomes 315 * 216 = 68,040. *Much* better.\n\nThe action is confirmed: `buy_and_use_consumable` with position `[2]`. No need to rethink; Pluto's in position 2. I'm buying the High Card upgrade with the shop consumable command! My intention is to play High Card and I estimate the chips will be 68,040.\n\nDouble checking the shop again to be sure:\n1: Droll Joker\n2: Pluto\n3: Merry Andy\nYes, Pluto is still in position 2.\n\nThe command is correct: `buy_and_use_consumable`. I'm using the schema.\nI had used the command previously to use the hermit, but now I know the shop has shifted. I am good to go!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
