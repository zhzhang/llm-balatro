{"reasoning":"**The Investment: A Calculated Skip**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 2, Small Blind, reward: $3, but the Investment Tag – that's the real draw. $25 after the Boss Blind... that's a serious chunk of change.\n\nInitially, I see the immediate value in playing: *Trading Card* for a quick $3, *Mail-In Rebate* potentially generating $5-$10, and *Gift Card* adding some long-term sell value. With hands and interest, it's about $15-$20 immediately. But that $25 from the Investment Tag... it's a game-changer for early economy. It allows me to buy Jokers at the shop, and build out my engine.\n\nThe catch is that if I skip, I don't get the round bonuses, which would be an \"end of round\" effect for *Gift Card*. I also don't get the chance to use *Trading Card* or *Mail-In Rebate* immediately.\n\nHowever, $25 early on is often a game-winner. That kind of capital opens up the shop for aggressive buying. Skipping to Big Blind then skipping to Boss, with the $25 from the Investment Tag after... That's the plan. It's a risk to skip for this round, but the long-term payoff is huge. The Investment Tag is a popular strategy for a reason.\n\nLet's do it. Skip the round.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
