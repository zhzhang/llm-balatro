{"reasoning":"**Jumbo Standard Pack Purchase: The Pre-Flight Checklist**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Round 5, Shop phase. I've got $55 and a solid Joker setup: Gift Card (Holo, +10 Mult), Mail-In Rebate (Foil, +50 Chips + income on discards), Trading Card (econ and thinning), Photograph (x2 Mult on first face card), and Hanging Chad (retriggers). Plus, Justice (glass card). The goal is to beat The Goad, who debuffs Spades.\n\nMy core engine is Photograph + Hanging Chad. If I play a face card first, the Photograph triggers 3 times (8x mult). Gift Card adds the flat +10 mult at the end. I'm also getting a solid +50 from Mail-In Rebate. Blue Joker is tempting in the shop (+100 Chips based on deck size, so less as I thin), but I'm hesitant to lose the rebate income right now. Hallucination is pointless since I've already opened the Celestial pack.\n\nThe Jumbo Standard Pack is the best remaining option. I need to improve my deck quality. It's a safe buy at $6, and I can afford it. I'm going to pick up that pack and then evaluate.\n\nI've got a debuff to consider from The Goad. Spades are debuffed. This means I MUST play a non-Spade face card first to trigger Photograph/Chad.\n\nAlright, the logic is sound.\n\nNow let's verify my assumptions.\n\n*   Joker order? Doesn't matter for Photograph and Chad. They trigger on scoring. Gift Card is independent. Mail-In Rebate is independent.\n*   Is Photograph/Chad affected by debuffs? If a card is debuffed, Jokers that trigger on that card do *not* trigger. So non-Spade face card first!\n*   The math: (Base Mult * 2 * 2 * 2) + 10 = total score.\n*   Re-checking money: I'm good. I have $55. Buying Jumbo Standard Pack at $6 = $49. With $49 and assuming standard interest rules, that will net me $9 interest ($1/every $5).\n\nOkay, time for action.\n\nFinal confirmation: `buy_booster` is the command, and the Jumbo Standard Pack is at position `[1]`.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}\n```\n\nDouble-checked the JSON.
