{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: A Calculated Stance**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 4, Round 6. I've got a solid $40 in the bank, and my Jokers are already forming a potent engine. \"Gift Card\" with its +10 Mult and scaling sell value, the \"Photograph\" (X2 Mult), \"Hanging Chad\" for the re-triggers, \"Stuntman\" adding chips, and \"Pareidolia\" making all cards face cards – a good foundation. Consumables \"Justice\" and \"The World\" are in the wings.\n\nThe immediate shop options? Zany Joker (+12 Mult on 3 of a kind), Ceremonial Dagger (Scales Mult by eating Joker to the right), and Lusty Joker (+3 Mult on Hearts). Not seeing anything that significantly boosts my already strong setup. The reroll cost is a reasonable $7, keeping me above interest cap if I reroll once. My goal is clear: beat the round, optimize the scoring engine, and capitalize on that interest.\n\nThe key to this round is the synergy between *Photograph, Hanging Chad,* and *Pareidolia*. With the \"Photograph\" and \"Hanging Chad\" combo, I'm getting an X8 mult on the first card played. Stuntman is a nice flat bonus, though the hand size decrease is a minor trade-off. Gift Card's Holo effect providing +10 Mult also scales the sell value of my Jokers and consumables, which is valuable long-term.\n\nZany Joker is irrelevant because my current engine is strong. Ceremonial Dagger is too risky, I don't want to destroy my useful jokers for a modest + mult. Lusty Joker is useless for my Spades focus.\n\nI need to decide: reroll or go forward? I want to keep $25 for the max interest, but a reroll might turn up a juicy Planet card or a better Joker (but I'm not seeing any options for boosters). Considering the Gift Card's scaling effect, advancing to the next round seems the most efficient. I'm already in a strong position.\n\nI need to consider the joker order. Photograph triggers when the card scores, Hanging Chad triggers when the card scores. Gift Card is a flat mult to the total at the end of scoring (because the bonus is from an *edition*). Is the order important?\n\n1: Gift Card (Holo +10)\n2: Photograph (x2)\n3: Hanging Chad (retriggers)\n4: Stuntman (+250 chips)\n5: Pareidolia (face cards)\n\nI need to be sure the x2 and the +10 mult are in the correct place. I have to put them in the correct place, but it seems there's no reason to change the order. The Holo +10 is an independent edition that occurs *after* card scoring. X mult from Photograph happens during card scoring. Stuntman happens during card scoring. Thus, (mult * 2 * 2 * 2) + 10. The order doesn't matter, and the current order is perfect because the Gift Card's scaling happens *after* the card has already scored with the \"X8 Mult\".\n\nCurrent plan: move to the next round. But before I advance, I'll take a quick look. I've got the key component (Pareidolia). The economy piece is sold. I have $40. Reroll is $7. The next blind is a \"Big Blind\" on Ante 4. With X8 Mult and +250 chips, I should easily clear it. And I need to have the Gift Card to make the most of its \"add sell value\" effect.\n\nI want the Gift Card to trigger its end-of-round effect as much as possible, for long term value. Should I reroll once? Maybe find Jupiter or a useful Tarot? $40 is plenty, and I'd be above the interest cap if I spent $7. However, with no boosters or good Tarots showing up in the shop, I'm sticking with moving on.\n\nI'm ready. I have no need to use consumables in the shop (I have to use them in the round). I'll go to the Blind Select phase. No need to rearrange jokers. I've checked the math. I need to make sure the math is correct:\n\n(Base Mult * 8) + 10. The multiplier from the photo is happening before the \"edition\" bonus.\n\nCurrent Jokers:\n1. Gift Card (Holo +10 mult)\n2. Photograph (x2 mult)\n3. Hanging Chad (retrigger)\n4. Stuntman (+250 chips)\n5. Pareidolia (utility\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
