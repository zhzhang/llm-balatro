{"reasoning":"**Ante 7, Round 15: The Spectral Gamble**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 7, Round 15. BLIND_SELECT step. Small Blind is up, 35,000 chips. Big Blind is 52,500, and then \"The Eye\" Boss Blind, which is a single-hand type requirement – not a problem for my High Card build. I'm currently at $24. Jokers are Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (holo), and Pareidolia. My hand is a High Card, Level 4.\n\nI have two choices: play the Small Blind or skip. Playing nets me about $34 total ($24 + $3 + interest), and a shot at the shop. But skipping gives me an Ethereal Tag, and the chance for a Spectral Pack. These packs can be insane: Ankh (copy/destroy), Hex (polychrome/destroy), Wraith (rare joker/0 money), Sigil (suit change, useless here), Ouija (rank change, useless), Ectoplasm (-1 hand size, very strong late), or Immolate (thinning + $20).\n\nMy build is already strong. With the current setup, my High Card should score around 68,440: (295 chips * 232 mult). That’s more than enough to handle the Blind progression. The Boss, \"The Eye,\" is trivial since I'm running High Card.\n\nNow, do I risk it for the Spectral Pack? The $3-5 from the Small Blind + Shop is negligible in comparison. If I get Ectoplasm, Hex, or Immolate, this could be the run I take to Ante 11+.\n\nI did do a quick check on the Joker order, as I should. I've confirmed that the triggers are in the optimal order:\n*   Played card scores\n*   Smiley (+5)\n*   Photograph (x2)\n*   Hanging Chad retrigger\n*   Stuntman (Holo edition, +10 mult and +250 chips)\n\nI'm confident in the calculation: 295 chips, 232 mult. That should easily one-shot the Blinds. I have to gamble on the Spectral Pack. The Ethereal Tag is worth way more than a shop refresh at this point. I'm going to **skip this round.**\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
