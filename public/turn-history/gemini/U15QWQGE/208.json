{"reasoning":"**Ante 8: A High-Stakes Gamble**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, Shop phase, $29 in the bank. My Joker lineup is potent: Photograph, Hanging Chad (x2 Retrigger), Stuntman, Pareidolia (all face cards), and Sock and Buskin (x1 Retrigger on face cards). The strategy is High Card, leveraging Pareidolia to make everything a face card and then triggering Photograph's x2 Mult with Chad and Sock and Buskin. Stuntman chips in with chips and some mult, too.\n\nThe current threat is the Crimson Heart boss, randomly disabling a joker each hand, which could kill the synergy. The Vouchers are Telescope (guaranteed Planet in Celestial Packs), Overstock Plus, and Director's Cut (boss reroll). I also have \"The World\" consumable (3 to spades).\n\nThe Shop's offerings are lackluster: Wrathful Joker (Spades Mult, not ideal), Turtle Bean (+5 hand size, temporary), Cloud 9 ($ per '9' in deck), and Green Joker (scaling mult, too late). Tarot Merchant is there, too.\n\nMy current scoring potential is good – last hand was over 210,000 against a Big Blind of 100,000. The Boss Blind is normally 300,000, and could be much higher. The question is: do I risk Crimson Heart or reroll the boss?\n\nI can reroll the shop ($6) and still afford a Boss Reroll. Rerolling the shop could give me a Celestial Pack. Alternatively, I can save the money for the next shop. I have the Director's Cut Voucher. I have a lot of money (interest cap is $25).\n\nThe round is 18. I've finished the Small Blind, and Big Blind is up next, then the Boss. I don't need to reroll the Boss *now*. I can see if I have more money/better options after the Big Blind or if I still want to risk Crimson Heart.\n\nI have $29 now. I'll save to maximize interest or afford more items in the *next* shop. I don't need Turtle Bean (hand size boost). I don't need Cloud 9.\n\nI need to reroll to potentially find a celestial pack, and will wait to see the next shop to decide on a Tarot Merchant.\n\nI'm safe to move on.\n\n**Joker Order Analysis:**\n\nNow, let's optimize my Joker order. My thinking is to maximize the scoring event:\n\n1.  Card scores.\n2.  Photograph (x2 Mult) triggers.\n3.  Chad triggers, re-scoring the card and re-triggering Photograph.\n4.  Sock and Buskin retriggers.\n\nPhotograph is essential (x2 Mult when scored). Chad retriggers. Sock and Buskin adds one extra retrigger.\n\nPhotograph, Chad, and Buskin are \"On Scored\" effects, and \"On Scored\" Jokers trigger left-to-right. I *must* have Photograph at the front. The order of Chad and Buskin doesn't matter, since they both just create a scoring event. The same is true for Stuntman.\n\nThe Holo edition of Stuntman gives +10 Mult. However, the order of Jokers matters *only* if I have two mult Jokers. Since my mult Jokers are on separate steps, the order doesn't matter (so long as Photograph is first). The holos will trigger in step 5, after the others.\n\nThe order is optimal:\n\n1.  Photograph (x2 Mult)\n2.  Hanging Chad (Retrigger)\n3.  Stuntman (Holo, +10 Mult)\n4.  Pareidolia\n5.  Sock and Buskin (Retrigger)\n\nFinal decision: I will proceed to the round screen. I also don't need to convert to spades. I will not reroll the shop again, nor buy Tarot Merchant.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
