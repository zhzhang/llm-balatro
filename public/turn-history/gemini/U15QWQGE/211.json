{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Shop Assessment**\n\nAlright, it's ante 19, and the goal is to beat the Crimson Heart boss – that's the one that disables a random Joker each hand. I've got $41, and my current setup is all about maximizing the triggers on Photograph. It's a risk, because losing a key Joker like Photograph or Pareidolia spells disaster. Right now, I'm running High Card at level 7, so it's a solid start.\n\nThe setup relies on Photograph, Hanging Chad, Pareidolia, Sock and Buskin, and Stuntman. The plan is to trigger Photograph as many times as possible with the first card played. Pareidolia is important, because it makes all cards face cards. Chad and Buskin will re-trigger the first card. Losing any joker significantly decreases the score, so Crimson Heart is dangerous.\n\nI need to decide what to buy. I have the Director's Cut voucher for boss rerolls. I have Pluto in inventory, which is level 7 and boosts High Card. I also have the Telescope. The shop has a few interesting items: Ancient Joker, Shoot the Moon, Fortune Teller, The Star, Jumbo Celestial Pack, Mega Standard Pack, and the Tarot Merchant.\n\nHere's my immediate thought process:\n\n1.  Use the Pluto consumable right away. It'll boost my High Card.\n2.  Buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack because it is guaranteed to have Pluto, thanks to the Telescope.\n3.  I need to evaluate the boss reroll. Crimson Heart is a HUGE risk with my current setup. Losing Photograph or Pareidolia would be a run-ender, and $10 for a reroll seems like a wise investment. I could do this at the Blind select screen, after I buy.\n4.  Then I'll evaluate the shop and see if there are any other crucial upgrades.\n\nNow, I'm getting ahead of myself, I can only do one thing at the shop. The priority is to use that Pluto and level up. So, the single action is to use the consumable. I will wait and see if it is worth the reroll.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
