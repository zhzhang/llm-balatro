{"reasoning":"**My Analysis for Round 2, Big Blind, Ante 2/8**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My target is 1200 chips, and I'm currently at $19. I've got a couple of Jokers in play: the Gift Card for +10 Mult, and the Mail-In Rebate, which is a big deal – +50 Chips and $5 per discarded Ace. I've also already used the Trading Card this round.\n\nMy hand is Ace(S), King(S), 7(S), King(H), 2(H), 2(C), Jack(D), 2(D). That's interesting… I can make either a Three of a Kind with the 2s or a Full House with the 2s and Kings.\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n*   **Three of a Kind (2s):** Base 30 Chips, 3 Mult. Adding the Mail-In Rebate and Gift Card brings it to (30 + 50 + 6) = 86 Chips and (3 + 10) = 13 Mult. So, the score is 86 * 13 = 1118. Close, but not enough to reach my target of 1200.\n*   **Full House:** Base 40 Chips, 4 Mult. The Jokers give me (40 + 50 + 26) = 116 Chips and (4 + 10) = 14 Mult. That's 116 * 14 = 1624. That's *definitely* over 1200!\n\nOkay, so the Full House is the play. I have one discard left, and I also have an Ace in my hand. Crucially, the Mail-In Rebate is giving me $5 for each discarded Ace. That's a no-brainer. I'll discard the Ace (pos 1), some junk (pos 3 and pos 7), and then play the Full House with my remaining cards.\n\nSo, the optimal discard looks like this: discard the Ace of Spades (Pos 1) for the money, and the 7 of Spades (Pos 3) and the Jack of Diamonds (Pos 7). That leaves me with the Full House of 2s and Kings (positions 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8). That way, I'll get $5 for the discarded Ace and still have the Full House to get over my target score. The prompt states the action to use should be \"discard\", and my positions are [1, 3, 7].\n\nJust to double-check, I'll review the Mail-In Rebate. Yes, it still gives me $5 for discarded Aces.\n\nOkay, let's make sure I didn't miss anything. The prompt states to `discard <card1> <card2> ... <card5>`, so I'm discarding positions [1, 3, 7]. Yes, that's correct.\n\nLet's confirm the Full House scoring one last time. It's: Base Chips = 40, Base Mult = 4, Joker Chips = +50, Joker Mult = +10, Card Chips = 10 + 10 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 26. Total Chips = 40 + 50 + 26 = 116, and Total Mult = 4 + 10 = 14. So, the Score is 116 * 14 = 1624. Perfect.\n\n**Action:** discard 1 3 7.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,7]"}
