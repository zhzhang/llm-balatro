{"reasoning":"**The Optimal Play: A Red Seal Symphony**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 4, Round 7. Standard Jumbo Pack. Got $45, aiming for 7500 to hit the Big Blind. My hand size is six thanks to Stuntman, which is a key consideration. Let's see... the hand: 6 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts (Foil), 8 of Diamonds, 2 of Diamonds (Gold), and a 9 of Spades with a Red Seal.\n\nAlright, analyzing the options. The 6 and 8 of Hearts offer nothing special. The Foil 2 of Hearts is decent, but with Stuntman already offering +250, I need more substantial value. The Gold 2 of Diamonds seems okay for economy, but I can't be fiddling around with holding cards with this hand size.\n\nHowever, the 9 of Spades with Red Seal...now we're talking. This is where my engine sings. I have Photograph and Hanging Chad active. Pareidolia makes the 9 of Spades a face card, which is crucial for Photograph.\n\nHere's the setup: Hanging Chad (retrigger 1st card 2x) + Photograph (X2 Mult on 1st face card). Red Seal retriggers the 9 of Spades. So, if I play the 9 of Spades *first*:\n\n*   9 (chips) -> Photo (X2).\n*   Red Seal retrigger: 9 (chips) -> Photo (X2).\n*   Hanging Chad retrigger 1: 9 (chips) -> Photo (X2).\n*   Hanging Chad retrigger 2: 9 (chips) -> Photo (X2).\n\nThat's a total of an X16 multiplier from the first card alone. Compared to my current X8, that's a massive jump! Plus, Spades work well with \"The World\" too, even though Pareidolia reduces suit importance.\n\nLet's double-check the trigger logic: Red Seal triggers *before* Jokers, according to Balatro rules, so the sequence is: Card Scores -> Red Seal Retrigger -> Hanging Chad Retrigger 1 -> Hanging Chad Retrigger 2. Yup, that's four scoring events for the first card, and thus an X16 multiplier.\n\nTherefore, the 9 of Spades with Red Seal is the clear winner; it perfectly scales my existing X-mult engine.\n\n**Action: `select` Position: `5`**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [\n    5\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
