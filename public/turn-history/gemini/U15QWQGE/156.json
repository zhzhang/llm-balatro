{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy and Action**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 7/8 with $42 in the bank. My Joker setup is solid: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), and Pareidolia. This relies on the first card being a face card thanks to Pareidolia. The goal is to scale up High Card. I have the \"The World\" consumable which I will keep. The shop has some interesting options, but the **Telescope Voucher** ($10) is the clear winner here because it guarantees Mercury (High Card) in future celestial packs.\n\nI'm definitely buying the Telescope. This will cost me $10, leaving me with $32. I considered buying the Spectral Pack or Arcana Pack, but the guaranteed long-term benefit of the Telescope outweighs the potential gamble. I have $42, more than enough. I've double-checked my Joker order, as the on-scored jokers will trigger in a certain order. Smiley Face, then Photograph, then Hanging Chad, then Stuntman (independent), then Pareidolia. This maximizes the mult and chip generation from my core combo.\n\nThe initial plan was to buy the Telescope first, then maybe a Spectral Pack, but I am going to buy the Telescope, and then hold the remaining cash. I re-read the instructions, re-evaluated my options, and decided to stick with the most reliable move. The Spectral pack *could* have been game-changing, but I prefer the reliable scaling of the Telescope voucher. I have made the correct decision.\n\nJSON: `{\"action\": \"buy_voucher\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
