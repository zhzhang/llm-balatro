{"reasoning":"**Final Push: Shop Decisions in Ante 8**\n\nAlright, this is it, the final stretch. I'm at Ante 8, Round 17. Let's see, $48 in the bank, and my strategy is crystal clear: high card, leveraging Pareidolia to make every card a face card, and then maximizing xMult with Photograph and Hanging Chad on a single card.\n\nMy current arsenal consists of: Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Photograph (X2 Mult for first face card played), Hanging Chad (Retrigger the first card twice), Stuntman (Holo) (+250 Chips, +10 Mult, -2 hand size), and Pareidolia (All cards are face cards). I also have \"The World\" which will be useful for spades. My hand level is at level 7 for high card and it's base stats are 65 chips and 7 mult.\n\nThe shop offerings are... not great. Green Joker (+1 Mult per hand, -1 per discard) is too late to be useful. The Idol (X2 Mult for King of Diamonds) is tempting, but the suit restriction is too risky when I'm relying on Pareidolia. Wily Joker (+100 Chips for 3 of a Kind) is irrelevant since I'm running High Card. And then there's Blue Joker (Foil) which grants +2 Chips per card in deck + 50 Foil chips, that would be 158 chips for me right now.\n\nI'm getting around 66,950 chips per hand right now. This is a bit low, but I will need two to four hands to beat the Boss Blind.\n\nSo, the big question is, should I reroll? I have $48, and a reroll costs $10.\n\nLet's do some math: Replacing Smiley Face with the Blue Joker would be a loss of about 22,750 chips. It's safe to say Smiley Face is better.\n\nWhat about Pareidolia? I don't think I can safely ditch Pareidolia. Face card draws aren't guaranteed, and that would leave my combo dead in the water. So Pareidolia is also safe.\n\nNo to the Green Joker. No to The Idol. No to Wily Joker.\n\nI *do* have Telescope which guarantees Pluto cards in Celestial Packs. And I'd love some Tarot Packs for Steel or Red Seal cards. But there are no packs, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, I'm going to take a reroll, hoping for better Jokers, flat X-mult, or a card that amps up chip generation. Reroll!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
