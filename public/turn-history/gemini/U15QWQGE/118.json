{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: Balatro Round 10**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5/8, Big Blind at 16,500. My current build is centered on High Card, and thanks to Pareidolia, all cards are face cards. This, combined with Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, and Stuntman, gives me a powerful engine. I'm sitting on $25, and skipping the blind nets me a Spectral Pack (Ethereal Tag). But I'm going to play for the gold and shop potential - I need Pluto cards!\n\nLet's break down the economics: Playing gives me $4 from the blind, roughly $5 interest, plus around $1 per hand. So, around $35, plus two shops. Skipping gets me the pack, so roughly the value of $8 or so, but only one shop. The Spectral Pack could be huge (Ankh, Hex, etc.), but it’s a gamble. My build is already strong.\n\nI re-evaluated the Joker order. Smiley (+5 mult) and Photograph (x2 mult) must come before Hanging Chad (retrigger), for optimal scaling. I double-checked the scoring sequence. The order is, in fact, correct: Smiley then Photograph, which is critical.\n\nI thought about the Boss, The Mark, and how the \"Discard 2 cards\" doesn't matter for a High Card build.\n\nLooking at the Spectral Pack options, some cards like Ankh (duplicates a Joker) or Hex (Gives Polychrome) could provide insane value. However, the shop is usually worth more given the focus on deck consistency and the pursuit of Pluto cards (High Card levels). I considered Immolate for thinning the deck, but I don't need it.\n\nUltimately, more shops are better at this stage, so I should play the round to maximize profits and shop visits. Plus, I have Director's Cut (reroll boss). This setup is stable and has solid scaling.\n\nI have my Justice card too. I can't use it in the shop so I'll wait to play a card during the round, and use it then.\n\nSo, the optimal play here is to play the round, maximize money, and search for specific cards (Pluto, etc.). This ensures better scaling and more rerolls. I am going to play the round. The action is `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
