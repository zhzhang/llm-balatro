{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 7/8, Round 16. I'm in the shop, Arcana Pack - Tarot selection. I've got $47, and the goal is to max out High Card strength for the upcoming boss blind, \"The Eye,\" which means focusing on a single hand type. My Jokers are Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia – a potent combo that amplifies face card values massively, even non-face cards thanks to Pareidolia. I also have \"The World\" consumable and the Telescope voucher, guaranteeing Pluto cards in Celestial Packs.\n\nLooking at my hand: Jack of Hearts (Bonus), 6 of Hearts, 8 of Diamonds (Gold), 7 of Diamonds, 4 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds (Foil). The pack choices are: The High Priestess (up to 2 random Planet cards), Death (card conversion), and The Hermit (doubles money up to $20).\n\nInitially, I'm leaning towards *The Hermit*. Adding $20 to my $47 would give me $67, which is significant capital for rerolling Celestial Packs and hunting down those valuable Pluto cards. This is, by far, the most guaranteed value.\n\n*Death* is tempting because I could potentially duplicate my Foil 3 of Diamonds to another card. However, the Red Seal 9 of Spades (a powerhouse I've been relying on) isn't in my hand, making Death less impactful than it could be. And as a reminder, my hand currently consists of a Jack of Hearts (+30 chips), an 8 of Diamonds (Gold) and a 3 of Diamonds (+50 chips, Foil).\n\n*The High Priestess* is unreliable because it gives random planets, and I have only one consumable slot open. I'd need to sell or use \"The World\" first to get both planets. And I can't guarantee Pluto.\n\nSo, *The Hermit* it is. $67 is a lot of money to find Pluto cards. $47 is enough for a few rerolls, but the Hermit gives the most value.\n\nOn further review, I re-evaluate:\n1: Jack of Hearts (Bonus)\n3: 8 of Diamonds (Gold Card)\n6: 3 of Diamonds (Foil)\n\nThe \"Death\" option can let me turn any card into a Foil 3 of Diamonds or another Bonus Jack of Hearts. But $20 is probably worth more than a single Bonus or Foil card in the long run for finding Planets.\n\nI'm at Level 4 for High Card. I really need to get that level up. \"The Eye\" is the boss, and I need high points in one hand type. The Hermit is the safest play to ensure I can hunt for Pluto cards.\n\nOne last check. Converting a card into a Foil 3 of Diamonds (+50 chips) isn't as good as +20 dollars for the chance at Pluto (+15 chips, +1 mult per level).\n\nThe selection is the Hermit, position 3. No cards need to be selected in hand.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
