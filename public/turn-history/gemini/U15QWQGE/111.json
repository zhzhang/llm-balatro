{"reasoning":"**The Path to Glory: A Calculated Risk**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 5/8, Round 9. It's BLIND_SELECT time, and the immediate decision is whether to play the Small Blind or skip for the Investment Tag. Let's break this down. My inventory is looking solid: a potent face card synergy build with *Smiley Face*, *Photograph*, *Hanging Chad*, *Stuntman* (Holo, which matters!), and *Pareidolia*. I've also got *Justice* as a consumable and the usual Vouchers, plus $26.\n\nThe Small Blind is 11,000 chips, the Big Blind is 16,500, and The Window (the Boss) is 22,000. My strategy centers on High Card, leveraging the *Pareidolia* to make all cards count as face cards, and then pumping those face cards with the *Smiley Face*, *Photograph*, and the *Hanging Chad* to re-trigger.\n\nLet's do the math. Assuming a card worth ~10 chips for the base, and all cards are face cards, I can hit a good High Card. The *Chad* retriggers twice. *Smiley Face* adds 5 mult. *Photograph* doubles the mult. So, each trigger goes: (Current Mult + 5) * 2. *Stuntman* adds a massive +250 chips and +10 mult (Holo).\n\nSo, my math shows the following:\n*   Initial: 5 + 10 chips, 1 mult\n*   Chad Trigger 1: 6 * 2 = 12 mult\n*   Chad Trigger 2: 17 * 2 = 34 mult\n*   Chad Trigger 3: 39 * 2 = 78 mult\n*   Stuntman: +250 chips, +10 mult\n*   Total Chips: 265\n*   Total Mult: 88\n*   Score: 23,320\n\nThis easily clears the Small, Big and Boss Blinds. *Chad*, *Photograph*, and *Smiley Face* are a potent trio. The *Window* won't hurt much, because my hand size is small anyway with *Stuntman*, and the base score is huge. Importantly, the Joker order needs to be *Smiley Face* then *Photograph*. *Stuntman's* chip bonus is added during card scoring (Step 3).\n\nNow, the dilemma: Do I play and take the Small Blind for $3 and a shop, or skip to the Investment Tag for $25? The tag seems strong, but shops are critical to find *Pluto* to level up the High Card. I'm sitting on $26. Playing the blinds would net me around $12. So, what's better: $25 now or a potential game-changing Joker/Planet?\n\nI'm considering that the Investment Tag offers significant value, but shops are where I can scale. I've had some weak shops lately, but I need *Pluto* to scale! This is a pivotal point. With the current build, I can beat the round and find a good card.\n\nDecision time: The $25 is good, but shop access for planet/Joker hunting is vital. I need that *Pluto*. Let's `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
