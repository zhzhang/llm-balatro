{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy and Immediate Action**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante is 7/8, we're pre-boss in round 16. I'm rolling with a High Card strategy, heavily reliant on Pareidolia to make everything a face card and thus trigger my Smiley Face and Hanging Chad multipliers. My current jokers are a powerhouse: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo), and of course, the all-important Pareidolia. My hand level is at 4 for High Card. I have $56, which isn't bad. I've got The World consumable but haven't used it yet. I need to keep the option to change strategy for the Boss, especially since \"The Eye\" is coming up, which prevents hand-type repetition.\n\nGiven my money situation and upcoming boss fight, the most logical move is to buy and *immediately use* The Hermit. It costs $3, but with $56, I can do it easily, and it guarantees me $20. That's a net gain of $17, putting me at $73. That's money that can be spent on rerolls for celestial packs. The Telescope voucher means if I find a pack, I'm guaranteed Pluto, which would substantially boost my High Card.\n\nLet's quickly rule out other options. Cartomancer seems tempting but would force me to sell a joker, and every joker is crucial for the synergy of the build. Supernova is a flat +8 mult which, compared to the potential of Smiley Face (+15 mult) in conjunction with my other jokers, is a definite downgrade. Egg doesn't offer any immediate benefit and has a scaling system that is no where near my current power.\n\nBefore I go, I'm reminding myself that \"The Eye\" can stop me. High Card is at level 4, but I *must* win with a different hand type. Director's Cut will let me re-roll the boss if I absolutely have to. I'm hoping I don't, but I will make sure to keep a hand that works just in case.\n\nSo the plan: `buy_and_use_consumable`, position 1 (The Hermit). This is the best use of my money. Then, I'll reroll the shop for Celestial Packs.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
