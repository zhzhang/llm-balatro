{"reasoning":"**Current Decision: Choosing a Celestial Pack Card**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, Round 3, at the SHOP and moving into the PLANET_PACK stage. Looking at my current setup: I've got a decent hand, nothing I want to ditch right now. My inventory is almost full with Jokers: Gift Card (Holo), Mail-In Rebate (Foil), Trading Card, and Photograph. No consumables. I have $51 in the bank. My hand levels are good; Flush is already Level 3 and Full House is Level 1.\n\nThe task is clear: Select a card from the Celestial Pack. The choices are: Mercury (Pair), Venus (Three of a Kind), and Jupiter (Flush).\n\nLet's break down the options: Mercury offers +1 Mult and +15 Chips for a Pair. Venus gives +2 Mult and +20 Chips for a Three of a Kind. Those are low impact in this case. Jupiter is where it's at, with +2 Mult and +15 Chips for a Flush. That perfectly aligns with my current strategy because I already have Flush at Level 3, and my previous high score was using Flush.\n\nClearly, the strategy is building a Flush. Jupiter will upgrade my Flush to Level 4. The command to pick is `select <pack_card_position>`. Jupiter is listed as choice number 3.\n\nSo, the action is `select`, the positions are `[3]` to select Jupiter. The intended hand type is definitely `flush` because I'm aiming to keep building on the Flush strategy. No need to estimate chips right now, `null` is fine.\n\nI need to double-check that the schema allows for the `select` action, which it does. And the position is `[3]`. I'm ready to make the play.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
