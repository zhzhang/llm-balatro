{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy for Maximum Value**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante 5, Round 10. I'm in the shop phase after the Small Blind with $31 in the bank. I've got a killer setup going, but I need to optimize it. Let's see...\n\nI'm running a High Card strategy based on Pareidolia, which makes *every* card a face card. I'm relying on Hanging Chad to retrigger the first card twice, leading to three scoring events, each of which is magnified by Smiley Face and Photograph. Stuntman is also contributing significant flat chips and Holo multiplier. And the Justice consumable gives us a glass card enhancement, which could give us an extra trigger.\n\nI've already crunched the numbers, but let's do a quick mental check. A basic 10-rank card (effectively a face card) scores like this:\n*   Base: 5 chips, 1 mult.\n*   Trigger 1: Mult = (1 + 5) * 2 = 12. Chips = 5 + 10 = 15.\n*   Trigger 2: Mult = (12 + 5) * 2 = 34. Chips = 15 + 10 = 25.\n*   Trigger 3: Mult = (34 + 5) * 2 = 78. Chips = 25 + 10 = 35.\n*   Stuntman Holo: Mult = 78 + 10 = 88.\n*   Stuntman Chips: Chips = 35 + 250 = 285.\n*   Total: 285 * 88 = 25,080.\n\n*And a quick note; in my last calculation, I included a Red Seal (9 of Spades), so let's check with that:*\n*   Trigger 4: Mult = (78 + 5) * 2 = 166. Chips = 35 + 9 = 44.\n*   Stuntman Holo: 166 + 10 = 176.\n*   Stuntman Chips: 44 + 250 = 294.\n*   Total: 294 * 176 = 51,744. (Close to the 51,216 reported).\n\nOkay, that confirms the power of this build!\n\nNow, the shop. Saturn (Straight), The Lovers (Wild Card), Strength (Increase Rank) are not relevant, so I'm not interested in those. I could get the Half Joker, but that gives +20 Mult if hand size is <= 3, which isn't the current strategy. Considering that I have Smiley Face, that could be a significant loss in efficiency:\n*   Without Smiley, with Half Joker:\n    *   T1: (1)*2 = 2.\n    *   T2: (2)*2 = 4.\n    *   T3: (4)*2 = 8.\n    *   Stuntman Holo: 8 + 10 = 18.\n    *   Half Joker: 18 + 20 = 38.\n*   With Smiley: 88 Mult (from 3 triggers).\nSo the Half Joker would be a huge downgrade. Not worth it!\n\nThe Jumbo Standard Pack for $6 is the real play. This gives me a chance to find a Red Seal card (the holy grail with this build), better ranks (even though Pareidolia makes that less critical), Steel cards, or blue seals for planets.\n\nI have $31. Buying the Jumbo Pack leaves me with $25. Perfect! That keeps me at the maximum interest level, which is usually capped at $25.\n\nAnte 5 Big Blind is 16,500. The Boss Blind is 22,000. My current build can easily clear 25,000-50,000 per hand.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to buy the Jumbo Standard Pack. I'm going for it.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
