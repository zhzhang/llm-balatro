{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop in Ante 8 with a High Card Build**\n\nAlright, final ante, round 17, and I'm sitting on $53. My goal is to maximize the High Card build, which is what I'm currently rolling with to beat Ante 8. The current Joker setup is pretty sweet: Smiley Face in position 1, Photograph in position 2, Hanging Chad in position 3, Stuntman (Holo) in 4, and Pareidolia in 5. This Pareidolia-driven High Card is working great, turning everything into faces, boosted by Hanging Chad and Photograph. My High Card hand level is 6, giving me 55 chips and 6 mult. I have The World consumable ready to go.\n\nNow, let's dissect the shop. I've got Ice Cream (a temporary boost, but I have Stuntman), Midas Mask (useless now), The Magician (low impact), and Sly Joker (High Card build doesn't use it). I can also buy a Standard Pack, Tarot Merchant, or a Boss Reroll. I've also got a $5 reroll available.\n\nMy Joker strategy is the heart of my plan. I've got Smiley Face, Photograph, and Hanging Chad working in tandem. Hanging Chad retriggers, so Photograph should trigger on each retrigger. *Wait*, does Photograph trigger on retriggers? Yes.  I need to get the order right for maximum impact: Smiley Face and then Photograph. Let's make sure. The rules say \"On scored\" Jokers trigger left-to-right. Okay, if Smiley is first, it should trigger *before* Photograph for the highest mult. Check this. If Smiley Face is on the left, my base mult (6) plus Smiley (+5) gets multiplied by Photograph (x2), giving me a huge mult total. Now, I need to check the order of independent Jokers.\n\nSo, the optimal order is Smiley Face (1), Photograph (2), Hanging Chad (3), and Stuntman (4, Holo). Hanging Chad's place within the other Jokers doesn't matter for the retriggers, just that it triggers *after* the card has done its base scoring. So, the order doesn't matter.\n\nNow, to calculate the score:\n\n1.  (6 + 5) \\* 2 = 22\n2.  (22 + 5) \\* 2 = 54\n3.  (54 + 5) \\* 2 = 118\n4.  118 + 10 (Stuntman) = 128\n\nHowever, the \"first played face card\" is the card with the triggers. So, I will get the bonuses on each trigger.\n\nNow for the Standard Pack. The Tarot Merchant could be good, for future shops. I have $53, so I have to weigh the options.\n\nConsidering my current setup, a Standard Pack might offer something crucial: a Red Seal or Steel card for in-hand mult, or even a Glass card for scoring. Since I am only playing one card per round, this would provide a massive benefit.\n\nOkay, I'm going to buy the Standard Pack. Time to roll the dice.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
