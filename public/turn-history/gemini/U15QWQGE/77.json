{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Pareidolia for Maximum Synergy**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 4, Round 6, with $37 in the bank. I'm running a Flush build, currently level 4. The core of my strategy hinges on getting a *Photograph* trigger. My current Joker setup is solid: *Gift Card* (+10 mult, scaling sell value), *Trading Card* (deck thinning), *Photograph* (x2 on first face card), *Hanging Chad* (re-triggers first card), and *Stuntman* (+250 chips, but reducing hand size to 6).\n\nThe shop has some interesting options, but I'm focusing. *Zany Joker* is out; it doesn't align with my build. *Ceremonial Dagger* *could* be powerful, but only if I'm willing to part with the *Gift Card* which is providing incredible scaling. It's a tempting thought, but it would weaken my current cohesion, at least in the short term. *Lusty Joker* is irrelevant for my Spades focus.\n\nHere's the critical point: *Pareidolia*. \"All cards are considered face cards.\" This is a *game-changer* for my setup. *Photograph* gives X2 mult on a face card, and *Hanging Chad* retriggers. With *Pareidolia*, *every* card is a face card! That means my first card gets an instant X8 boost (x2 from Photo, twice retriggered). If I have *Pareidolia*, I don't need to sweat drawing a face card at all.\n\nI have 5 Jokers, so to get *Pareidolia*, I need to sell one. *Trading Card* is the obvious candidate. It's useful for deck thinning and economy, but *Pareidolia* makes my scoring engine bulletproof, and with *Stuntman* making my hands smaller, consistency is key. Selling it loses $3 per round and some deck thinning, but guarantees a much larger mult floor from *Photograph* every single round.\n\nOkay, let's solidify the move. I'm going to *sell* *Trading Card* ($8 sell value) to buy *Pareidolia* ($5). This leaves me with $40 after buying, still well above the interest threshold. My Joker order will be: *Gift Card*, *Photograph*, *Hanging Chad*, *Pareidolia*, *Stuntman* (with *Photograph* and *Chad* near the front, though the order doesn't matter much with this synergy).\n\nWith this setup, the scoring sequence will be: 1. Chips from the played card + Stuntman 2. Card score 3. Photograph triggers (X2) 4. Hanging Chad retriggers 5. Card score 6. Photograph triggers (X2) 7. Hanging Chad retriggers 8. Card score 9. Photograph triggers (X2) 10. Other cards score 11. Gift Card (Holo) adds +10 mult. My total mult will be (Base Mult * 2 * 2 * 2) + 10. *This* is a strong play. The entire mult is scaled and consistent. *Pareidolia* is the choice to lock it in.\n\nThe *Ceremonial Dagger* thought keeps coming up but I think that the current engine, once *Pareidolia* is slotted, is much better.\n\nThe action is clear. I need to make room for *Pareidolia*. I need to `sell_joker 2` (Trading Card).\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
