{"reasoning":"**Round Analysis and Strategy**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 3, Round 5. Blind Select. The Goad is the boss, and I need 4,000 chips to win. I've got $49, which is enough to handle any unexpected costs. I have a solid Joker lineup: Gift Card (Holo), Mail-In Rebate (Foil), Trading Card, Photograph, and Hanging Chad. The Goad's debuff is Spades, which is easily managed by avoiding them.\n\nMy core strategy revolves around Photograph and Hanging Chad. Photograph gives me a x2 Mult on the first face card played. Hanging Chad retriggers that first card twice. The order of operations is crucial here: the card scores chips, then Photograph triggers (boosting Mult), and then Chad re-triggers the Photograph twice more. This creates a chain reaction.\n\nIf I lead with a face card (non-Spade), it’ll score some chips, and then Photograph will trigger, leading to an effective x8 Mult! I also have the Gift Card, which is a Holo Joker, and it's a flat +10 Mult, and the Mail-In Rebate for a straight +50 Chips.\n\nLet's do the math on a Pair of Jacks (non-Spades). We're looking at 80 chips and 26 Mult. That gives us 2,080. If I can hit a flush (non-Spade), I could get around 160 chips and 90 Mult, which is a whopping 14,400. That's more than enough.\n\nThe goal is to get to 4,000. It seems very achievable with this setup.\n\nJustice is in my consumables, which will give a Glass card. I could use it for a nice boost, but I don't really need it this round. I can save it for later.\n\nRegarding Joker order, the triggers for Photograph and Chad are based on the *card*, so the order of those two doesn’t matter. However, editions on Jokers trigger in a final scoring phase, left-to-right. I have Gift Card (Holo) as +10 Mult. My current order is: Gift Card (+10), Mail-In Rebate (+50 chips), Trading Card, Photograph (x2), Hanging Chad. I need to keep Gift Card to the *left*. The +10 Mult from Gift Card will be added after all the card triggers. It'll work just fine. I think it's optimal this way.\n\nSo, the +10 is added at the very end. The scoring sequence is: 1) Boss Blind, 2) On played Jokers, 3) Played cards score (Photograph/Chad trigger here), 4) Held-in-hand, and 5) Independent Jokers (Gift Card Holo +10 mult here).\n\nMy available actions are to `play_round`, `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, or `sell_joker`. I am currently in `BLIND_SELECT` phase.\n\nI'm ready. The smart move here is to `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
