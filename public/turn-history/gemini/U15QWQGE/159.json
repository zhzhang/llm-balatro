{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Phase Analysis - Ante 7/8**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's round 15, shop phase, and I've got $28. This is the critical Ante 7, so let's see how to best set up for survival.\n\nMy hand setup right now is looking *very* strong, centered around High Card. Pareidolia makes everything a face card, and with Hanging Chad retriggers, the *first* played card scores three times. Photograph and Smiley Face are crucial here; they give an *insane* multiplier for face cards. Stuntman gives a solid chip and mult boost.\n\nI've got a few options in the shop: a Saturn, Egg, a Joker, Splash, and an Arcana Pack booster. The current hand is High Card with Mercury being a possible pull via Telescope (meaning there will be Celestial packs).\n\nThe Jokers are fixed unless there is an X-mult upgrade, or a superior multiplier.\n\nThe Arcana Pack is a cheap $4 buy, and it could offer anything from money (Hermit/Temperance) or deck manipulation (Death, Strength), even Tarot cards for an edge. It's a low-cost, high-potential value move. I can afford it easily and still have $24 (or more, if I get money back). Rerolling is an option, but it costs $5. It's a gamble I'm not willing to take right now, as it might not be worth it.\n\nOkay, let's quickly review: I just realized I *need* to account for inventory space. I have 5/5 Jokers and 1/2 Consumables. Arcana Pack it is.\n\nBased on everything, the ideal action is clear: buy the Arcana Pack. It's efficient, given the financial situation. The order of the Jokers isn't critical *for* the core scoring sequence given my Jokers, but I did a sanity check on the best placement and my current order is optimal.\n\nAlright, the final decision: I'm buying the Arcana Pack booster.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
