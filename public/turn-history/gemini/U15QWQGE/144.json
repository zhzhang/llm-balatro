{"reasoning":"**Ante Up: Strategic Shop Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 6, big blind approaching, and it's time to take stock. I've got $28, enough to be comfortable, and my inventory is looking solid: that Smiley Face is gold, the Photograph is a multiplier machine, Hanging Chad is set for some serious re-triggering, and Stuntman and Pareidolia are helping with raw chips.\n\nThe core of this build is rock solid: Chad is going to be re-triggering face cards, which are *all* cards thanks to Pareidolia, and then Smiley Face is adding a flat Mult to each card. The photograph then doubles the Mult for those face cards.\n\nI'm thinking hard about the optimal Joker order to maximize the synergies. Let's make sure everything fires in the right sequence: Smiley Face and Photograph have to go first, which they are. Hanging Chad retriggers, so the order doesn't matter, though I have Smiley and Photograph first. I should use the Red Seals and consumables.\n\nRight now, the shop is looking thin. Obelisk is a non-starter. Gluttonous/Lusty are too weak to be worth a slot. I have Stuntman already, so Hiker is not great. The Standard Pack might give me a Red Seal.\n\nHiker is tempting, but is it better than Smiley Face? No. Smiley Face currently contributes 20 flat mult per hand, which is more important than the chips Hiker would provide. I have Stuntman for chips.\n\nI've got $28, but I want to stay above $25 for interest, so I need to think carefully about how to spend it. Rerolling the shop for $5 is an option, but not worth it. I'm already winning.\n\nMy hand strategy is well-defined: High Card and Red Seal 9s, boosted by the Jokers. The Hierophant is important here. I *can't* use consumables in the shop.\n\nSo, I'm going to take this build into the next round. I'm checking if I can/should use my consumables before starting the round.\n\nRerolling doesn't seem to make sense. I'll get better value building up. I'm just looking for something *extra* at this point, not a core.\n\nI've just run the math, and I'm comfortably above the big blind, even before the Hierophant card!\n\nOkay, time to re-read the shop cards. It's time to check Photograph and see how it works. That retrigger is very powerful.\n\nLet's do the math again. The base score is 25 + 250 (Stuntman). With the Photograph + retrigger combo, I'm going to be pushing over 100,000. 100k + is plenty for Ante 6. I'm going to be set.\n\n*Yes*, Photograph *does* work on retriggers. That's *huge*. That means the current Joker order is the right one.\n\nThe shop is pretty much exhausted. I'm comfortable moving forward.\n\nShould I buy the Standard Pack? It *might* give me a Steel card, but it's probably not worth it. I am set to go into round select.\n\nLet's re-read the Jokers. The Joker order is solid. I can win as is. I have the Hierophant and I can use the consumables in the round!\n\nOkay, time for action. Let's move to round select.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
