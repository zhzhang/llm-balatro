{"reasoning":"**Round Decision: Play the Blind!**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 4/8, Round 6. It's the BLIND_SELECT step, and the current blind is the Small Blind – 5,000 chips. We have a D6 Tag active, which is tempting because it will give a $0 reroll in the next shop, but after weighing up the options, the rewards for playing far outweigh the benefits of skipping.\n\nLet’s quickly recap. I have $40. My Jokers are Gift Card (Holo!), Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. My consumables are Justice (Glass Card) and The World (Spades). My Flush is Level 4, worth 80 chips and 10 mult.\n\nI'm thinking about the synergy here... Pareidolia turns everything into face cards. Photograph and Hanging Chad give us a potential X8 multiplier on the first card scored. Stuntman is a massive chip booster, and Gift Card is adding +10 mult and $1 sell value to everything.\n\nPlaying the Small Blind has a few immediate benefits. I get $3, potential interest (capped at $5, but I'm close), and crucial Gift Card scaling. That's a total immediate value of about $12.\n\nSkipping and taking the D6 tag for a free reroll in the next shop is tempting, but the Gift Card alone gives me $7 in sell value this round. The $0 reroll is nice, but it's not worth sacrificing the Gift Card's benefit.\n\nThe plan is this: play the blind. I have 5,000 chips to clear, Stuntman gives +250 chips. My Flush build is solid, especially with Pareidolia turning everything into face cards. If I play a 10, that’s 10 chips + 80 (Flush) + 250 (Stuntman) = 340 chips. The mult: (10 Base + X) * 8 (Photograph/Chad) + 10 (Holo). That’s (10 * 8) + 10 = 90 Mult. That's a potential 30,600 chips in a single hand! That's more than enough. The Boss Blind requires five cards, which is perfect for a Flush build.\n\nSo, I'm confident in playing and collecting all the rewards. The next step is `play_round`. Let's crush this blind!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
