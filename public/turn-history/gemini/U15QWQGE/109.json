{"reasoning":"**Strategic Deep Dive: Ante 5/8, Round 9**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5/8, Round 9. I've got $33, which is nice. My Joker lineup is solid for this High Card build: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad (Holo), Stuntman (Holo), and Pareidolia. I also have a Justice consumable and Overstock, Overstock Plus, and Director's Cut vouchers. The current strategy is to maximize the synergy between Chad, Photograph, Smiley Face, and Pareidolia, which should be generating some serious points.\n\nThe shop is... not great. Crazy Joker is out because I'm not doing straights. Odd Todd might be okay with +31 Chips for odd cards, but Stuntman is already crushing it with +250 Chips, so no swap there. Mystic Summit is tempting with +15 Mult if I have zero discards. Smiley Face, however, is giving me way more consistent value with three triggers from Chad, so that's a no. Lusty Joker? Forget about it, +3 Mult for Hearts is practically useless. This shop is a bust.\n\nNow, let's make sure my Joker order is optimized. It's currently Smiley Face (1), Photograph (2), Hanging Chad (3), Stuntman (4), and Pareidolia (5). Wait a second... let's run through the scoring. I'm thinking: base chips and mult first, then Jokers that trigger \"on scored\", followed by any re-triggers. The Chad triggers go: Base, then Smiley Face, then Photograph, then repeat! Smiley Face first, then Photograph, to maximise the multiplier. Stuntman and Pareidolia add some spice at the end, making everyone a face card. Yes, that order is right.\n\nI have $33. The reroll cost is $7. Even if I reroll, I'll still have $26, which is above the $25 threshold to get the maximum interest, so that's good. What am I looking for? I need either a High Card level (Pluto) or some seriously good X-mult. The ideal scenario would be a Planet, Tarot, or Spectral booster.\n\nHmm, is Mystic Summit worth considering? It's $5. If I sell a Joker for it, which one? Smiley Face gives me +15 mult total (3 triggers from Chad). Stuntman is giving me +20 mult. Mystic Summit gives +15 mult, conditionally. No, none of these options are improvements. The shop is still empty of anything useful.\n\nRight, my goal here is to find Pluto or another booster. Therefore, my action is: Reroll.\nReroll shop actioned. The shop doesn't have anything I need right now, I need to find something like Pluto or another booster. The reroll keeps my interest and hopefully will reveal a better set of options.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
