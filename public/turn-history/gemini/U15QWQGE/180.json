{"reasoning":"**Balatro Ante 7, Round 16: The Mouth**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 16, and the blind is \"The Mouth.\" This means I can only play one hand type this round, so I need to choose wisely. Looking at the data, I've got 70,000 chips to hit, and I have a solid High Card build that can clear that easily, so I'll stick with that. \"The Mouth\" isn't a threat for this build. I'm rocking Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. This is a solid high-card setup. I have the \"The World\" consumable, but it won't help here. I have a boss reroll, but that's unnecessary for \"The Mouth.\"\n\nI will now calculate. I have a Level 5 High Card (45 chips, 5 mult).  Pareidolia will turn all cards into face cards, setting up my Jokers. Stuntman gives me +250 chips and +10 mult (Holo). So the base score is 295 chips, 15 mult. The first card scores, triggering Smiley (+5 mult) and Photograph (x2 mult). Hanging Chad then retriggers the card twice more, for an additional trigger. The final score should easily clear 70,000 per hand. I have four hands, so I'm good. I rechecked the order, and it's perfect: Smiley, Photo, Chad, Stuntman, and Pareidolia. Time to play the round. Here's the JSON.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"play_round\"}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
