{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Shop: A Deep Dive into Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, Round 11, SHOP phase, $36 in the bank. I've got a killer High Card engine cooking, and the goal is to maximize the score on a single High Card play. My inventory is looking sweet: Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Photograph (X2 Mult for first face card), Hanging Chad (Retriggers first card 2 times), Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size, +10 Mult from Holo), and Pareidolia (All cards are face cards). I also have two consumables: The World (Convert 3 cards to Spades) and The Hierophant (Enhance 2 cards to Bonus Cards).\n\nThe strategy is clear: Pareidolia turns everything into face cards, *Photograph* doubles the first one, *Smiley Face* adds mult, and *Hanging Chad* triggers this insane sequence three times. *Stuntman* just adds a massive chip boost and some mult. The order is crucial: Smiley Face (1), Photograph (2), Hanging Chad (3), Stuntman (4), Pareidolia (5). Smiley must come before Photograph, otherwise the multiplier doubles the wrong number.\n\nI run the math: 2 base mult, + 5 Smiley = 7, then Photograph x2 = 14. Chad retriggers this twice, so 14, then another 14. Add the Stuntman bonus. The resulting mult will be around 96. With Stuntman's chip boost, I should be looking at around 28k. I am getting these exact numbers, so this is good.\n\nNow, the shop: Hallucination, Riff-raff, and Odd Todd. Not impressed. No space for new Jokers, and Odd Todd isn't better than what I have. I can't use the Tarot cards yet, I'm in the shop. I need to be in a round to enhance cards in my hand. Interest is capped, I am above that cap. Should I reroll?\n\nI should be looking for *Pluto* to level High Card. Or *Blueprint* or *Brainstorm* to duplicate the effect of Chad or Photograph. Rerolling is better than proceeding, given my goals. I have $36, a reroll costs $7. I should be able to keep above interest cap with the next round. I'll take a look at the previous game states.\n\nWait, I just bought and used The Emperor! So now I have The World and The Hierophant. I can't use them. I need to reroll or proceed. Given my excellent build, I can safely proceed. But since I want to *level High Card*, I should reroll.\n\nLet me think it through one last time. Current Money $36. Reroll Cost $7. $36 - $7 = $29. I am above interest cap. The shop is bad. I have The World and The Hierophant. I need to find Pluto for the High Card level. Or a duplicated Chad or Photograph.\n\nI'll check the Joker order. Smiley (1) Photograph (2) and Hanging Chad (3). The order seems optimal. I can reroll. I could proceed to the round to earn money. I have plenty of money.\n\nThe `Hanging Chad` position doesn't matter, it's an Independent Joker, which simply re-triggers the scoring sequence on the card, but it doesn't modify the order of the scoring sequence for the card.\n\nI will *reroll_shop*. I might as well try to find the Planet Pack. Since my last instructions say to return a single action, I'm going to return a JSON array with one item. I have a lot of money and I can always earn more. I am going to keep going.\n\nFinal answer: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
