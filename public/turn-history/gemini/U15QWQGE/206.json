{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Pack: Ace of Spades (Steel Card) is the Play**\n\nOkay, Ante 8, Round 18. STANDARD_PACK, got it. $34 in the bank. Let's see... Jokers are looking good: Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman, Pareidolia, and Sock and Buskin. I also have The World consumable ready to go. The goal, as always, is to maximize my High Card score and prep for the final boss. I'm focusing on re-triggering face cards, something this Joker combo makes easy.\n\nThe pack choices are: 8 of Diamonds, 2 of Hearts, and Ace of Spades. Hmm... 8 of Diamonds is garbage. The 2 of Hearts (Wild) is tempting in other builds, but right now, it offers little value for my High Card strategy. Now, the Ace of Spades (Steel Card)... that's the one! It stays in my hand, gives a direct x1.5 mult bonus, and, because I'm running Stuntman, my hand size is reduced, so every card slot is critical. A Steel Card is a significant upgrade in this situation.\n\nSo the call is easy: I'm selecting the Ace of Spades at position 3. That's a clear 'select 3'. It's all about maximizing this High Card build. My action is *select*, position is *3*, intended hand type *High Card*. I can estimate my chips from the last round (200k+). Now I can move to the next play. Time to execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
