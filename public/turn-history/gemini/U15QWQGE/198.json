{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Final Shop for Maximum Score**\n\nOkay, final Ante, let's make this count! My goal is clear: obliterate the final boss. I've got $34 and a killer hand setup revolving around a High Card build. Pareidolia makes everything a face card, so I can leverage Photograph (X2 Mult on the first face card), Hanging Chad (retrigger the first card twice), and Sock and Buskin (retrigger all face cards). I also have Stuntman Holo (+250 Chips, +10 Mult, but -2 hand size).\n\nThe key is this synergy: Each time my first card scores (which is a face card), Photograph triggers (X2 Mult). Hanging Chad retriggers this, and Sock and Buskin retriggers all face cards too, meaning they ALL re-trigger Photograph. Stuntman Holo helps add to the Multiplier.\n\nI can buy a Steel Card with The Chariot card! The Steel Card gives a 1.5x multiplier to the card in hand. With my current setup, it’s going to provide a significant boost!\n\nThe calculations are pretty straightforward: My initial High Card level (7 Mult), the Stuntman bonus (10 Mult) and the base chips (65) are activated. With Photograph, and the retriggers, I'm looking at a massive score. The Chariot, which costs $3, seems like the perfect option.\n\nI quickly check the order of operations in Balatro. Photograph (X2) is an \"On scored\" Joker. Hanging Chad and Sock and Buskin trigger it repeatedly. I need to make sure I don't overlook anything.\n\nOkay, I bought Sock and Buskin last turn! I forgot. It's time to purchase The Chariot to get the Steel Card for a 1.5x multiplier.\n\nThe other shop cards are weak, especially the Jokers, and my Joker slots are full. Rerolling the shop for better consumables seems like a gamble I don't need to take right now. The Tarot Merchant voucher is tempting for future games, but in this situation, not as useful as buying The Chariot.\n\nI need to confirm the order of operations for the Jokers.  Let's see: I play the face card, it scores, Photograph triggers, and Hanging Chad, and Sock and Buskin re-trigger it. It works! I double-check the description of each Joker to make sure I understand the precise order of operations.\n\nI'm ready to buy The Chariot.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
