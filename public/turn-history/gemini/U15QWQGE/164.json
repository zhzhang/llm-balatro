{"reasoning":"**The Calculated Risk of the Spectral Pack**\n\nOkay, here we are at Ante 7, Round 15. That skipped Small Blind for the Ethereal Tag wasn't ideal, especially considering that abysmal Spectral Pack offering of Hex and Ouija. Now, the Big Blind is staring me down at 52,500 chips, and the Boss Blind, \"The Eye,\" wants a solid 70,000 chip-earner of a hand. I am really banking on this build for the Boss.\n\nMy Jokers are: a Smiley Face, a Photograph, a Hanging Chad, a Stuntman (holom), and Pareidolia. The plan? A High Card strategy, leveraging Pareidolia to make *every* card a face card. That triggers Smiley Face and the Photograph and, crucially, Hanging Chad will retrigger the first card. I initially estimated around 60k but my math was off.\n\nLet's carefully calculate this. High Card at Level 4 gives us 35 chips at 4 mult. The first card's base is: 35 + 250 (Stuntman) + ~10 (card value) = 295 chips. With Smiley and the Photograph, we are looking at 295 * ((4 + 5) * 2 + 5) * 2 + 5) * 2 + 10 = 33,040 chips.\n\nI need to re-think this... I think that would be enough to clear the Big Blind in two hands... but I'm being too conservative, and this is a solid build, so the Boss should be easy. I just have to remember the order of operations: Base Mult = 4, Card 1 = (+5 from Smiley) * 2 (from Photograph), Retrigger 1 (+5 Smiley) * 2 (Photograph), Retrigger 2 (+5 Smiley) * 2 (Photograph), and an independent Stuntman Holo of +10 Mult, which lands us at 33k. Recent history tells me it is possible, and I could reach 85k with a bit more luck. I need money.\n\nSo, the Spectral Pack: should I skip the round for another shot at it? I just skipped the Small Blind's Ethereal Tag because the options were weak. The Spectral Pack is high variance. The Boss needs to scale to about 100k, and with $24 now, playing gives me $32, including interest. \"The Eye\" is *perfect* for this High Card build. It is the safe play for the shop.\n\nLet's quickly check the Joker order. Smiley Face, then Photograph, then Hanging Chad. This means it's: Card 1 -> Smiley/Photograph, Retrigger 1 of Card 1 -> Smiley/Photograph, Retrigger 2 of Card 1 -> Smiley/Photograph. It's the right order.\n\nImmolate, Ectoplasm (a negative!), Ankh, Hex (risky), Aura, or Wraith, could come from a Spectral Pack. The high ceiling could be worth skipping. But the play is to build economy. Playing is safer with $32, allowing rerolls in the shop. The Big Blind is 52,500. Two High Cards is a sure thing.\n\nPlay, the round is the correct choice to get $32 and the shop access. The command list is `play_round` or `skip_round`. I need money for the Ante 8 shops.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
