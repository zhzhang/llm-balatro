{"reasoning":"**The calculations are locked in.** I'm in Round 17, Ante 7/8. The Boss Blind (\"The Mouth\") restricts me to one hand type this round, so I need to choose wisely. My goal is 70,000 chips, and I have $25 to work with. My Joker setup is key: Smiley Face, Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo edition), and Pareidolia. This is a potent combination. My initial hand contains a 3 of Diamonds Foil, a Lucky King, and a Queen of Spades. I can play Flush and High Card hand.\n\nI've already crunched the numbers, I had 71,904 in the previous round, and I know I can easily exceed 70,000 with a High Card strategy given these Jokers. I *must* use High Card for this round thanks to The Mouth. If I play it right, I can crush it. The plan is this: The scoring card must be the 3 of Diamonds (Foil) in a High Card. Pareidolia makes all cards face cards, Smiley Face adds +5 Mult for played face cards, Photograph doubles the Mult of the *first* face card, and Hanging Chad retriggers the first card an additional two times. The Stuntman (Holo) gives a +10 Mult, which is critical.\n\nI've checked the Joker order and it's optimal: Smiley before Photograph. It *must* go this way, as Smiley before Photo maximizes the mult. Stuntman's chip bonus adds to the hand score, and the +10 mult from the Holo edition triggers after the standard Joker abilities but before the edition.\n\nMy refined calculation is: base 45 chips + 250 (Stuntman), then add the 3 of Diamonds Foil for 53 chips each time. The mult starts at 5 (High Card Level 5), then Smiley brings it up to 10 (5+5), Photo doubles it to 20 (10*2), and Hanging Chad retriggers this 2 times. I had to double check the Hanging Chad retrigger logic and the logic around Photograph - it triggers each time a card is scored. This brings me to: (20+5)*2 then (50+5)*2. Then the Stuntman Holo brings in the final mult +10. The card count is 454 (base + foil). 120 mult * 454 chip is 54,480.\n\nA key realization: only the scoring card in High Card triggers the \"when scored\" abilities. That means the Smiley Face and Photograph only trigger on the 3 of Diamonds.\n\nThe Mouth restricts me to one hand type, so after I play High Card, I can play two in total. Even though I have 4 discards, I can not go to another hand. Playing High Card twice will bring me way over the goal.\n\nBefore I commit, I double checked, because I'm not sure how I got 71,904 chips previously - was there a better hand, a higher card, or a different order? With my current setup, the numbers are rock solid. I even went over what could be missing from the last round and confirmed that this is my best option. Also, Smiley and Photograph will only trigger once on the 3 of Diamonds card itself. There isn't an enhancement that could get me over 70,000 as a result.\n\nThe plan: Play the 3 of Diamonds as a High Card. It should score around 54,480. Then, play a second High Card to finish the run. I *must* stick with the High Card, thanks to The Mouth!\n\nFinally, I've re-verified that Photograph will retrigger with the Hanging Chad, which means this is solid. The final numbers are 54,480. I am ready to `play` that hand, using the cards in position `[6]` as `high card`, and expect a final `54480` chips.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [6]"}
