{"reasoning":"**High Card Strategy in the Crimson Heart Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 8, round 19. I'm staring at a Jumbo Celestial Pack – currently in PLANET_PACK. My inventory is stacked with Jokers: Photograph, Hanging Chad, Stuntman (Holo!), Pareidolia, and Sock and Buskin. I also have The World consumable and $35.\n\nMy pack choices are Pluto (High Card), Mercury (Pair), Venus (Three of a Kind), Uranus (Two Pair), and Earth (Full House). The Telescope voucher guarantees Pluto is in here, which is perfect because my strategy is all about High Card spam, specifically leveraging Photograph, Chad, Buskin, and Pareidolia. My High Card hand is already at Level 8, which is great, the current build's core and most played hand (12 times!).\n\nThe goal here is simple: Maximize that High Card level. So, given the constraints of a Planet Pack, the choice is clear: **I need to grab Pluto**. The prompt specifically says \"select 1 of up to 5 Planet cards to be used immediately.\"\n\nInitially, I almost forgot that `select` command usage is `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1>...`. But because Pluto doesn't target hand cards, it just takes the one value. So the correct action is to `select 1` and let the game do its thing. Let's make it happen.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
