{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 6, Round 13. I've got $34, five Jokers, and two consumables, The World (Spades) and The Hierophant (Bonus cards). High Card is level 3, Flush is level 5. I've been running High Card, and it's been working, clearly, since I'm at Ante 6.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty dialed in: Smiley Face for +5 on face cards, Photograph for X2 on the first face card, Hanging Chad to retrigger the first card two times, Stuntman (Holo) with a massive +250 chip boost and +10 Mult, even with the -2 hand size, and Pareidolia making all cards face cards. With all cards face cards, the synergy is perfect for the Smiley, Photo, Hanging Chad, Stuntman combo, and the current build is optimized for High Card. I scored 68k last round.\n\nLooking at the shop, the *Obelisk* is tempting for passive, but to make that even remotely viable I'd need to shift away from High Card, which is a big gamble given where I am in the game. I don't think +3 Mult from *Gluttonous Joker* or *Lusty Joker* is going to cut it either, not with what I already have. *Hiker* is good long-term, but multipliers are where it's at for a High Card build. I have Stuntman already.\n\nThe remaining options are the *Jumbo Arcana Pack* for $6, and the *Standard Pack* for $4. My deck is thin because of the hand size penalty, so I shouldn't expand too much. Given how powerful the current Joker setup is, and the fact that I want to improve this, I'm going to take a chance on the Jumbo Pack. This should provide some deck manipulation if I need it.\n\nSo, the plan: Buy the *Jumbo Arcana Pack*.\n\nI should confirm again that my Joker order is optimal. Currently it's Smiley (1), Photograph (2), Hanging Chad (3), Stuntman (4), Pareidolia (5).\n\nAfter reviewing the scoring rules, the scoring sequence will look like this: 1. Play card. 2. Card Scores. 3. Smiley (pos 1), triggers. 4. Photo (pos 2), triggers. 5. Hanging Chad (pos 3), retriggers. 6. Repeat steps 2-5 twice. 7. Stuntman (pos 4), independent Mult triggers. So the order is correct.\n\nThere is a $25 interest cap. So I can buy the Jumbo pack and retain the interest. It's time to hit that buy button.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
