{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Celestial Pack: The Path to Multiplied Glory**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 3/8, Round 5, just after the Big Blind and heading into \"The Goad\" Boss Blind. Money's at $55. Got some good Jokers: Gift Card (+10 Mult, holo, increases sell value), Mail-In Rebate (+50 Chips, foil, $5 discard 8s), Trading Card (delete 1 card for $3), Photograph (X2 Mult on first face card played), and Hanging Chad (retriggers first card played 2 times). Plus, I have Justice (Glass card) for a consumable. Opened a PLANET_PACK. Now, here's the decision: Uranus (Two Pair), Neptune (Straight Flush), or Mars (Four of a Kind).\n\nThe Goad debuffs Spades, but that doesn't really factor into my hand strategy. My current focus is on Face Cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) to maximize Photograph and Hanging Chad. My hand history isn't bad: Flush (Lv 4), Full House (Lv 2), Three of a Kind (Lv 1), Straight (Lv 1). The goal is to maximize the scoring potential.\n\n*   Uranus: Two Pair. I haven't leveled up Two Pair. Low impact. Not ideal.\n*   Neptune: Straight Flush. Sexy, but super hard to hit even with Trading Card thinning the deck. Too rare.\n*   Mars: Four of a Kind. This is it. If I can get Jacks or Kings to hit, this will explode with Photograph/Chad.\n\nNone of these choices are directly going to help my Flush or Three of a Kind, so Mars is my ideal play. Mars (Four of a Kind) offers the highest potential reward. Given I am thinning the deck, and I've got 2 Jacks, and can aim for specific ranks, like Jacks or Kings, to trigger Photograph and Hanging Chad, this is the smart move. So, Mars is the play.\n\nLet's quickly check the Joker order. Gift Card is first, then Mail-In Rebate, Trading Card, Photograph, and Hanging Chad. Wait. Need to analyze Photograph/Chad synergy. Chad retriggers the *first* card played. If the *first* card is a Face card, Photograph goes off, then Chad retriggers the card. So, Photograph goes off three times for X8 Mult! And then Gift Card adds +10 Mult.\n\nI need to quickly analyze the logic for scoring. The steps are:\n1.  Boss Blind.\n2.  On Played Jokers.\n3.  Played cards score (Chips, modifiers, On scored Jokers, Retriggers).\n4.  Held-in-hand.\n5.  Independent Jokers (Basic jokers, editions).\n\nPhotograph is an \"On scored\" joker, and Chad is a retrigger. Gift Card is a flat, \"Independent\" Mult Joker.\n\nIf a face card is played first:\n\n1.  Card scores.\n2.  Photograph triggers (X2).\n3.  Chad retriggers the card.\n4.  Photograph triggers again (X2).\n5.  Chad retriggers the card.\n6.  Photograph triggers again (X2).\n\nTotal: x8 Mult.\nAnd the Gift Card adds a flat +10 Mult, which is applied at the very end.\n\nBut, Photograph is Step 3, and Gift Card is Step 5. No matter where Gift Card is, it has to be at the *end*.\n\nSo, it's (Base Mult \\* X2 \\* X2 \\* X2) + 10.\nBack to the Celestial pack: Selection 3 (Mars) is the best choice for Four of a Kind, which is the clear winner for my strategy here.\n\nSelect Mars.\n\nNow, a final check. Do I have any consumable to use, or any Joker reordering needed? No. Justice is not needed yet. The joker order is optimal, as the holo Gift Card multi is applied last.\n\nNow, let's look again:\nMars, Four of a Kind.\n\nLevel 1 is 60 x 7. Level up (+30 chips, +3 mult) -> 90 x 10.\nTwo Pair is Level 1: 20 x 2. Level up (+20 chips, +1 mult) -> 40 x 3.\nStraight Flush is Level 1: 100 x 8. Level up (+40 chips, +4 mult) -> 140 x 12.\n\nI have a decent number of Jacks, and I'm deck thinning. Jacks are probably the best potential rank to aim for. Last turn I played 3 Jacks,\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
