{"reasoning":"**Deep Dive: Strategic Discard for Maximum Value**\n\nOkay, so the situation is this: I'm facing \"The Eye\" boss, the restriction is I have to play one hand type this round, and I only have a paltry 0 chips to my name. My goal is to rack up 10,000 chips, and I only have four hands to do it. Thankfully, I have a few joker cards to help me: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Stencil. I’ve also got 3 discards available.\n\nRight now, my hand is showing: Ace of Spades, 9 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 3 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, and King of Diamonds. A Flush seems like the most promising play. It's currently at Level 8, which is a nice starting point.\n\nMy initial thought is to go for a Spade Flush. I'm practically there with four Spades already in hand. I also have two Clubs. I need to get rid of the King of Diamonds because it doesn't help with a flush, plus it'll be essential for the *Blackboard* Joker to trigger; and the 2 of Clubs is even, so it's not a must-keep. Also, a Spade flush will work best with the *Odd Todd* Joker, as those cards are all odd-numbered.\n\nInitially, I consider holding the Clubs. My thinking: if I draw two more Clubs, I could have a Club Flush. But, with my remaining discards, I should try to get the strongest flush possible.\n\nSo here's the plan, I am going to discard 5, 6, 7, and 8 - the 9 of Clubs, the 3 of Clubs, the 2 of Clubs, and the King of Diamonds, to maximize my chances of getting a Spade (which would give me the best score), and if not, I can still aim for a club Flush. By getting rid of the Diamond and even card, I'm increasing my odds of triggering the Blackboard Joker, which will give me a x3 multiplier. I need to make the highest score possible since this is my only hand in this round.\n\nIf I get lucky, my hand after the discard and the draw will consist of five Spades. With *Blackboard* triggered, I'm expecting a massive score from the Flush and my Jokers.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8]"}
