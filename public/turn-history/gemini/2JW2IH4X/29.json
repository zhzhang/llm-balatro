{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy for Ante 2, Round 4**\n\nAlright, let's assess the situation. I'm at Ante 2, Round 4 with $8 in the bank. My hand's alright - Two Pair is at Level 2, and Flush is also Level 2. My Joker lineup is Odd Todd, a regular Joker, and Blackboard. Blackboard is my core strategy here – a potential x3 multiplier if I'm running all Spades and Clubs.\n\nThe shop presents a few options. Reserved Parking might offer some money if I get some face cards, but it doesn't help my scoring. The Star is a definite no-go – it converts cards to Diamonds, which is actively harmful to the Blackboard synergy. A Standard Pack looks tempting, adding a card to the deck for a chance at a key Spade or Club, or at least another odd-numbered card for Odd Todd. But at $4, I need to weigh the opportunity cost of losing $1 interest. Overstock Voucher is out of reach at $10. Reroll is also too expensive at $5, and the current shop isn't that amazing to warrant it.\n\nI've got a strong hand, and more importantly, a very strong scoring potential for this Ante. Blackboard, Joker, and Odd Todd should be enough to take down the Big Blind. I'm thinking the best move is to skip the shop entirely. Saving that extra dollar in interest is a solid move for future shops, and I can be patient. I don’t need anything from this shop to beat the blind.\n\nSo, the optimal move is `round_select`. I'm going to earn more money, and hopefully, find better items in the next shop. I don't need to change the order of my jokers (no interaction), since the additive mult is independent of card scoring. The order is: Odd Todd, Joker, Blackboard. The final move is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
