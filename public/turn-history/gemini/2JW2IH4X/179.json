{"reasoning":"**Okay, let's break this down. It's Ante 7/8, Round 19. I'm in debt, -$4 thanks to the Credit Card, but that's fine for now.** I've got a solid Joker setup: Odd Todd, Blackboard, Joker Stencil, Credit Card (the debt machine), and Constellation. The goal is to maximize score and prep for Ante 8, and the immediate thought is the x2 from Stencil is huge, which I'd lose by taking either Joker.\n\nRight now, Stencil is stuck at x1 because I have all five Joker slots filled. The obvious play is to sell the Credit Card to free up the slot and double that Stencil multiplier. I can always sell the Credit Card later to get the X2 multiplier back from Stencil if I really need the score for the Ante, but... wait. There's a Justice card in the shop. It's a consumable that gives a glass card - an immediate x2 multiplier for one card.\n\nConsidering I’m at -$4, it's a good idea to utilize the debt now. I have a -$20 debt limit from the Credit Card. If I sell Credit Card, I go to -$3. If I buy Justice, I go to -$7. Then I'd sell the card to go to -$6. Buying Justice with the debt capacity I have is a no-brainer. After some thought, I'm confident that the glass card's x2 multiplier is worth the $3.\n\nMy plan crystallizes: Buy Justice, then sell the Credit Card to get the Stencil multiplier back. I should buy Justice before I sell the Credit Card to create a more efficient strategy. Also, I have a Celestial Pack that will give me Jupiter.\n\nSo, I will buy Justice.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_card\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
