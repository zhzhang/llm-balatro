{"reasoning":"**Current Poker Strategy: Flush Focus**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. It's Round 21, the small blind, with 4 bucks and I need 50,000 chips. The goal is to maximize a Flush, which is Level 17, and then prep for the 100k Boss. My primary focus is building a strong hand. I have three hands remaining and two discards, so let's make them count.\n\nMy current hand is: Ace of Spades, Ace of Spades, 8 of Spades, 6 of Spades, Queen of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and a pesky Jack of Diamonds. I've got four Spades and three Clubs, which is a great starting point for a Flush. I'm holding a few key Joker cards: Odd Todd, Blackboard (which gives x3 Mult if all *held* cards are Spades or Clubs), Stencil (x2 Mult since I have an empty slot), and Constellation (currently x1). I also have Justice, which could be massive if used correctly.\n\nThe obvious play is to go for the Flush. Blackboard would be devastating, but the Jack of Diamonds breaks that condition. I could make a *minor* flush with the clubs, but I need two more, and, even then, the Flush bonuses are not as good. I need a Spade. So, the first logical step is to discard the Jack of Diamonds to try and draw a fifth Spade. But, with my Blackjack conditions, I'm going to discard the clubs I have as well.\n\nThe ideal scenario is to get a Spade for the Flush, but I have a high probability of making a Flush. Since I need to maximize a Spade Flush for a big score, I have to be smart about using my discards. I’m thinking I’ll discard the Queen of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and Jack of Diamonds. I'm going to hold onto any Clubs to maximize Blackboard and try to find a Spade to complete the Flush. I want that x3 Multiplier!\n\nI *will* wait to use Justice until I actually have the Flush, so I don't waste the benefit. If I make a Glass Ace, that's potentially game-changing. So, discard those cards, find a Spade, and then play to win!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8]"}
