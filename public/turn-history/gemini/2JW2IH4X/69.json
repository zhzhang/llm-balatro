{"reasoning":"**Strategic Poker Thoughts: Round 9**\n\nOkay, here we are, Round 9 with a goal of 4000 chips and currently, none to my name. Ante is 3/8, a seemingly inconsequential amount, but every chip counts. My hand size is 7, but the boss is hitting me with -1. I have $2. I have a voucher, Telescope, which favors a flush (matching my most played hand). I have four cards to play, and three discards. I have some powerful jokers.\n\nCurrently I'm holding Odd Todd which gives +31 Chips for odd rank (A, 9, 7, 5, 3), Swashbuckler, which boosts Mult and Blackboard which is the real kicker here: it delivers a x3 Mult if all cards held in the hand are Spades or Clubs. I also have Joker Stencil, currently giving a x2 Mult.\n\nMy hand: Ace of Spades, 8 of Spades, 4 of Spades, King of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and an 8 of Diamonds.\n\nAnalyzing this, it's pretty clear. I've got 3 Spades, 3 Clubs, and 1 Diamond (the 8). This gives me two potential paths. I need to get rid of that diamond. The Blackboard Joker demands a hand exclusively of Spades and Clubs. And if I want the telescope voucher to work, I should go for a flush. Right now, I'm thinking I can discard the 8 of Diamonds and maybe some of the even cards to hunt for better ones. I'm going for Blackboard!\n\nLooking at the distribution of the deck, I need either one more spade to make a spade flush, or two more clubs for a club flush.\n\nI need to get rid of that 8 of Diamonds to enable Blackboard, so I can discard that. I have plenty of discards (3, but I will discard more)\n\nLet's discard the 8 of Diamonds (pos 7), the 8 of Spades (2), the 4 of Spades (3) and 4 of Clubs (6). Keeping the Ace of Spades (1), King of Clubs (4), and Jack of Clubs (5).\n\nRationale: This leaves 3 cards in hand, allowing a draw of 4 cards and improving my odds of a flush or better cards. The discard of the Spades, Clubs, and Diamond cards would leave me with:\n\n`discard [7, 2, 3, 6]`\n\nThe plan is to get a flush and trigger Blackboard. 6,048 chips is the last flush.\nSo I should **discard [7]**.\n\nNow I'll discard those cards and see what the next draw brings.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [7]"}
