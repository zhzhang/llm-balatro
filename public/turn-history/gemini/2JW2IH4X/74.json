{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: Ante 4, Round 9**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 4, round 9. I've got $12. My Joker lineup is solid: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. Currently, a Flush is my best play.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are centered on maximizing my scoring potential and building the economy. Right now, I can hit about 23,000 with a Flush, potentially higher depending on Odd Todd's output. The shop has a few options, but they're making me think hard.\n\nThe Blue Joker looks tempting, +2 chips per card, but it would remove the Stencil's x2 multiplier, bringing it down to x1. That would *reduce* my score down to around 20,000, so that's a hard pass. Smiley Face is useless in my current build. Seed Money would be premature at this point.\n\nThe Standard Pack is the most intriguing. I *could* get a Spade or Club to boost Blackboard's consistency. However, I have Telescope! I should prioritize Celestial Packs when they appear, especially because I always get a Flush.\n\nMy instinct is to save the $12 to earn $2 interest at the end of the round. It's a reliable income source. I'm strong enough to clear this Ante. A random card from the Standard Pack feels like a gamble right now.\n\nI'm double-checking the Standard Pack cost and benefits, as I have Blackboard. I would benefit from an increase in Spades and Clubs in the deck. However, interest seems more reliable.\n\nWait, I can go to Round Select, so I don't need to spend any money.\n\nIs there anything else? No, the Jokers are synergistic. Stencil's x2 is the most crucial part.\n\nBut I really want to check the Standard Pack. If I find a card with a seal or enhancement, that's ideal. But interest is guaranteed money. $12 gives $2 interest.\n\nI will skip the current shop items and go to the round select to build economy.\n\nReroll costs $5. Not worth it.\n\nAlright, the shop doesn't have anything that significantly improves the current setup. Saving the $12 for interest is the most efficient play. Let's build that economy.\n\nAnte 4's chip requirements are relatively low, so the current score will do. Saving money to reach the interest cap ($25) is the priority.\n\nOkay, let's verify Stencil: x2 (correct).\n\nSaving money is best.\n\nFinal Action: Round Select.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
