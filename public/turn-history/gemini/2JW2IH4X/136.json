{"reasoning":"**Initial Hand Evaluation: Discarding for Blackboard Synergy**\n\nOkay, so Round 15, Ante 6/8. My goal is 40,000 chips. I'm starting at zero. The \"Head\" boss blind is active, which means all Heart cards are debuffed. I have four hands and four discards. This hand is a mess. I've got a debuffed Ace of Hearts, Jack of Hearts, a Six, a Five, and a Two of Hearts. Plus, a Six of Clubs and a Jack of Diamonds. I'm holding a five of spades, which is a nice start for Odd Todd.\n\nThe Jokers I have equipped are: Odd Todd (good for odd ranks), Swashbuckler (based on the sell value of the following 3 Jokers: 2,3 and 4), Blackboard (multiplies score by 3 if *all* remaining cards after the hand are Spades or Clubs), and Joker Stencil (x1 Mult for each empty joker slot).\n\nI'm focused on Blackboard. To get its full potential, I need a hand with *only* Spades or Clubs remaining after I play. Right now, I'm holding way too many Hearts. A Flush is available, but the debuffed Hearts are a major issue.\n\nSo, the plan is clear: **discard these debuffed Hearts and the diamond.** I have four discards available. I should probably play to my discards first and get a good hand from there. Since I need to discard the maximum number of cards to get the best chances, I'll go with the five debuffed Hearts.\n\nSo, I'm going to discard the five hearts.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
