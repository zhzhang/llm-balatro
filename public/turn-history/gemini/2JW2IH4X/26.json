{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Round: Play a Pair of 7s for Maximum Value**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 2, Round 4, with the Small Blind at 800 chips. I have a rather interesting hand: 7 of Spades (7S), 2 of Spades (2S), King of Hearts (KH), 8 of Hearts (8H), 7 of Clubs (7C), 6 of Clubs (6C), 3 of Clubs (3C), and King of Diamonds (KD). I have a few Jokers to consider: Odd Todd (which adds chips if I play a card with an odd rank), a plain Joker (+4 Mult), and Blackboard (x3 Mult if all cards *held in hand* are Spades or Clubs).\n\nMy goal here is to hit that 800-chip target and maximize my score. Let's see. Blackboard is the key. Right now, I have Hearts (KH, 8H) and Diamonds (KD) which are *not* Spades or Clubs. To get the x3 Blackboard bonus, those must go. I can play them, discard them, or ideally, *play them*.\n\nI can see that I have a Pair of 7s (7S and 7C). Odd Todd will give +31 chips each as 7 is an odd number. Let's see: 10 base chips, plus 7 for each 7, plus the Odd Todd bonus of 31 for each 7 makes 86 chips. The base mult is 2, plus the Joker is +4 and the Blackboard will multiply by 3, making a total of 18 Mult. Thus 86 * 18 = 1548 chips! Well over 800, that’s great.\n\nThe critical thing is to *hold* only Spades or Clubs after playing. So let’s play the 7s and play the other cards as well to clear them. If I play KH, 8H, KD, 7S, and 7C, then the remaining cards in my hand (2S, 6C, 3C) are all Spades or Clubs, so Blackboard *will* trigger.\n\nAlright, the action is `play`. I’ll select positions \\[1, 3, 4, 5, 8] (7S, KH, 8H, 7C, KD). The hand type is a `pair` of 7s. The estimated chips are 1548 - exceeding the 800 target!\n\nOdd Todd is active because 7 is odd, giving +31 chips for each 7 played. The Joker is active at +4 Mult, and Blackboard at x3 Multiplier is activated too.\n\n*   Chips: 10 + 7 + 7 + 31 + 31 = 86\n*   Mult: (2 + 4) * 3 = 18\n*   Total: 86 \\* 18 = 1548\n\nOkay, everything checks out.\nJSON is constructed:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 3, 4, 5, 8],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"pair\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 1548\n}\n```\nPerfect. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,5,8]"}
