{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Round 22 Action**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in Ante 8, with a Big Blind of 75,000 chips – that's the immediate target. The hand has been rearranged since the previous turn, with the Ace of Diamonds now in the 7th position, and the 7 of Clubs in the 8th. My current hand is: 8 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 5 of Spades, Ace of Hearts (Wild Card), 10 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, 7 of Clubs.\n\nThe Blackboard Joker offers a crucial X3 multiplier if *all* held cards are Spades or Clubs. Currently, the Ace of Diamonds is blocking that activation. The previous plan was to use \"Death\" to transform the Ace of Diamonds (position 7) into a 7 of Clubs (position 8), solidifying the condition for the Blackboard.\n\nLet's double-check the indexing. This game uses 1-based indexing, so position 7 holds the Ace of Diamonds and position 8 the 7 of Clubs. The \"Death\" card, our consumable, is at position 2. I have the sequence and the action: `use_consumable 2 7 8`. This will convert the Ace of Diamonds to the 7 of Clubs.\n\nAfter this transformation, my hand will be: 8 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 5 of Spades, Ace of Hearts (Wild), 10 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs. Now, all cards are either Spades or Clubs, triggering the Blackboard multiplier! I have everything I need, and the plan aligns perfectly with the previous turn's logic.\n\nTherefore, the action I'm executing is to `use_consumable` with the card being Death, and the target positions being 7, and 8. The correct command to execute is: `use_consumable 2 7 8`.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,7,8]"}
