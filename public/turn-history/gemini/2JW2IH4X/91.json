{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: Round 11 - Flush for the Win**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 4, and I'm starting from scratch. Goal: 10,000 chips. \"The Eye\" is telling me to stick to one hand type, which is fine since I can determine the first hand type. My hand is looking pretty solid for a Flush at level 8. I need to make the right choices to optimize this and get over 10,000 chips, to win. I have a few Jokers to consider: Odd Todd (+31 for odd cards), Swashbuckler (+9 Mult), Blackboard (X3 if *all* cards held are Spades or Clubs), and Joker Stencil (X2 Mult with one empty slot, but the text tells me it has X2, so no need to recalculate that).\n\nI have a hand with 6 Spades and 1 Club. That's a strong start for a Flush. I have to think about Blackboard and getting every advantage I can. Let's look at the cards: Ace of Spades, 9 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 3 of Spades, 2 of Spades, King of Hearts (a *red* card, oh no!), and Ace of Clubs. I see the King of Hearts immediately and think I can remove it if needed to trigger Blackboard.\n\nIf I play a Flush and keep the King of Hearts, Blackboard doesn't trigger. If I discard the King of Hearts, and maybe the 2 of Spades and 8 of Spades, I can play all Spades or Clubs. Let's look: I have to play the flush.\n\nI need to maximize my chips, so let's use all the odd cards for Odd Todd (+31 chips for A, 9, 7, 5, 3). The current odd black cards are: Ace of Spades, 9 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 3 of Spades, and Ace of Clubs. That's five cards. But, I am only playing one hand type, so I have to make a choice.\n\nIf I play these 5 cards: I get 336 chips, 54 Multiplier from base and my jokers, to get a score of 18,144. That's way over 10,000. But if I don't discard, I can't trigger Blackboard. Blackboard requires *all* cards to be Spades or Clubs, which isn't the case if I play the King of Hearts!\n\nLet's look at the discard and see how it works: I discard the King of Hearts, it's a risk! I might draw another red card. The discard doesn't matter since I have a win.\n\nIf I play a flush and don't discard, my cards are: Ace, 9, 8, 7, 3 (Spades) - 5 cards. Total score, after checking the math is 16,308. I've already confirmed that is higher than 10,000!\n\nCan I still trigger Blackboard? I need to get the King of Hearts out of my hand. I have two discards left! If I discard 7, 3, and 6 (King of Hearts, 8 of Spades, and 2 of Spades): I have 2 discards, and I can just play. But let's look at it.\n\nIf I play the flush, discarding 7, 3, and 6 (King of Hearts, 8 of Spades, and 2 of Spades) I get a higher score. I get ~16k * 3 = 48k. Why bother? It's the same result if I play it now.\n\nI have it! Let's do the math again. Level 8 Flush is 140 chips, 18 Mult. For the cards, I get 302 Chips. (140 + 38 (from the hand itself) + 124 (from Odd Todd)). Multiplier is 54 (18+9)*2. 16,308. Perfect.\n\nThe Eye doesn't affect my first hand. So, it should be fine. I'm going to play [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nLet's check the Jokers one last time: The math checks out. Let's make sure I'm not making a mistake. The text says X2 for Stencil. Yes, that is right. Let's check the counts... Yes, it's correct. I should play 1, 2, \n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
