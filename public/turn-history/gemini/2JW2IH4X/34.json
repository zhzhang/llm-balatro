{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Analysis of the Current Poker Hand**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 2/8, Round 5. Big Blind's completed. $12 in the bank. I've got a decent set of Jokers: Odd Todd, the basic Joker with +4 Mult, Blackboard (that juicy x3 for Spades or Clubs), and Joker Stencil, currently at x2. Max Joker slots are 5, so I'm close to full capacity. Next blind is the \"Boss,\" The Window, and unfortunately, it debuffs Diamond cards, which I have no information on the distribution.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Celestial Pack at $4 catches my eye. \"To Do List\" (pay $4 for a Full House) is inconsistent and \"Greedy Joker\" ($5) is a terrible idea for this boss. Overstock ($10) is a good, long-term play, but leaves me with very little.\n\nI've been planning to sell the basic Joker to power up the Stencil. Let's do the math again and see if that is the case. With my current hand levels (Flush Lvl 2, Two Pair Lvl 2, and Pair Lvl 1) the Joker's +4 multiplier is probably better. So it looks like my current setup is: (Base Multiplier + 4) * 2 * 3. Selling the basic Joker would give me Base * 3 * 3 = 9 * Base. The math says that only hands with a Base Mult higher than 8 would be in my favor.\n\nA Flush Lvl 2 has a base multiplier of 6. A Pair Lvl 1 only has a base multiplier of 2. I have 6 Mult from my Flush. I *definitely* want to keep the Joker! So selling it seems like a poor choice with the current set of hands.\n\nThe Celestial Pack is probably the best buy at $4 to increase my base stats. Then I will be set to use the x4 from the Joker Stencil. Let's start there. I currently have $12 and the Celestial Pack will be $4, so that makes $8 left.\n\nThe decision is clear: `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
