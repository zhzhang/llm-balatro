{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Round 15 Flush Optimization**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 15. The game step is STANDARD\\_PACK, and I have zero dollars – focusing purely on maximizing this hand. My inventory is pretty solid: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard (Spades/Clubs synergy), and Joker Stencil. My hand strategy is a Level 14 Flush, which I’ve played a good number of times (12), so I’m comfortable with it. The goal here is to select the best card from the Standard Pack to enhance the Flush strategy and leverage my existing Jokers.\n\nLet's look at the choices:\n\n*   **Choice 1: 4 of Clubs.** A Club! That works with Blackboard. The 4 is even, so no help for Odd Todd. It’s a Lucky Card, so can make a Tarot on discard, which is interesting, but my focus is on playing Flushes. It’s good for Blackboard if I hold it.\n*   **Choice 2: 10 of Spades (Steel).** A Spades! Again, good for Blackboard. The 10 is even – not for Odd Todd. This is a Steel card, so it provides a base X1.5 multiplier while held. This is the big one I am looking for.\n*   **Choice 3: King of Diamonds.** Diamonds are a problem, they break the Blackboard synergy. King is even, again no Odd Todd help.\n\nNow, a quick analysis. Odd Todd is out, no odd cards in the choices. Blackboard wants Spades or Clubs in my hand. Swashbuckler and Joker Stencil are static here.\n\nChoice 1, the 4 of Clubs, is good for Blackboard, with the added bonus of the lucky card which I discard, as I am playing Flushes.\n\nChoice 2, the 10 of Spades (Steel), is looking a lot better. That Steel multiplier is key. It's an independent X1.5 multiplier when held, perfect for boosting the Flush. The Spade is also great for Blackboard.\n\nChoice 3, the Diamond, is an instant reject.\n\nThe 10 of Spades (Steel) is significantly better. I'll take that. Independent multiplier when held, also satisfying the Blackboard condition for an additional x3.\n\nI'll select card number 2.\n\nLet's do a quick calculation of the estimated chips:\n\n*   Base Level 14 Flush: 230 chips, 30 mult\n*   Played cards (~280 chips, no odd)\n*   Mult: (Base 30 + Swashbuckler 9) = 39\n*   Held cards: Blackboard X3. Stencil X2. Steel 10 of Spades X1.5\n*   Final Mult: 39 * 3 * 2 * 1.5 = 351\n*   Total: ~280 * 351 ≈ 98,280\n\nThis is a good improvement, better than the last hand I played (77k).\n\nThen I need to check the JSON format. Yep, it parses. Single object, double quotes, no comments or control tokens. Schema is followed. All good.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
