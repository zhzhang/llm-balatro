{"reasoning":"**Current Turn Strategy: High-Risk, High-Reward.**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in a tricky spot with this *TAROT_PACK*, the *Jack of Hearts* is causing problems for my *Blackboard* Joker. The *Blackboard* Joker, if activated, gives a huge x3 Mult. But, if I hold a non-Spade/Club card, it disables. The *Jack of Hearts* is obviously a non-Spade/Club. I'm down -$6 and I need to quickly and efficiently score. I've got a decent hand (AS, AS, KS, QS, 10S, 5S, 3S, JH), *Odd Todd* (chips for odd ranks), *Blackboard* (x3 Mult), *Joker Stencil* (x2 Mult) and *Constellation* (x1 Mult, which I can scale higher). My *Justice* card is a *Glass Card*, just in case.\n\nMy first thought is, how do I deal with this Jack of Hearts. I have one choice left on my Mega Pack: the choice is between the *Wheel of Fortune, The Empress, The Tower, and The Devil*. I'm going to take the *Wheel of Fortune*. I could take *The Devil* for a Gold Card, but it wouldn't make the Jack of Hearts good. Or, the *Tower* would make it a Stone card (which... is it a Spade or Club, or not?), or the *Empress* makes it a Mult card (still a Heart). *The Wheel of Fortune* gives me the chance to upgrade a Joker. I'm really betting here on high value. The other options don't provide as much potential.\n\nI've already used a *Death* card to get an Ace of Spades. I just need to play this right and I should have the right points for the blind. I have -$6. I have a good hand. I don't see any other options. \n\nThe strategy is, pick the *Wheel of Fortune*, and discard the *Jack of Hearts* on turn. Then it's just about playing my hand. We'll get out of this hole.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
