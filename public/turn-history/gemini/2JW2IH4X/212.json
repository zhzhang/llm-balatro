{"reasoning":"**Alright, let's break this down. Ante 8, final boss. Verdant Leaf, right? Debuff city until a Joker's sold. Current situation: $1, a Level 17 Flush in my pocket, and a solid Joker lineup – Odd Todd, Blackboard, Stencil, and Constellation, though that last one's doing absolutely nothing. The boss's debuff is the main thing here.**\n\nOkay, the debuff.  It's crippling my cards, essentially setting them to zero chips, while still letting the base hand type (that Level 17 Flush: 275 chips, baby) and Jokers trigger.  Odd Todd will also still trigger.  If the cards are debuffed, they provide 0 chips, but the base chips and Joker effects still contribute. The Boss needs 100k, and with the debuff I get ~60k per hand. I have 3 hands to win.\n\nNow, Joker Stencil is begging to be used.  It's at x2 now, but if I sell *any* Joker, it jumps to x3 because that empty slot becomes relevant. Constellation, on the other hand, is a complete dud unless I start pulling Planets. With the Hieroglyph active, the debuff will need to be dealt with quickly. I need to make the x3 Stencil happen.\n\nSo, I have to sell a Joker to lift the debuff. Odd Todd gets me chip boosts, Blackboard gets me multipliers, and Stencil also gets me multipliers. Constellation's at x1, doing nothing, but selling it unlocks x3 for Stencil.  Selling Odd Todd is an option, but that makes the hand chips much lower (and the board is Spades/Clubs for Blackboard), and selling Stencil is a terrible option. Selling Constellation is the *obvious* move.\n\n*   Sell Constellation.  Bye-bye, x1. Hello, Stencil x3.\n\nLet's quickly recap: The boss needs me to sell a Joker to negate the debuff. Constellation provides a flat multiplier that isn't helping me right now (or really, at all). If I ditch it, I get Stencil at x3 and the debuff gone. This way, I can make sure I have the cards for the Blackboard multiplier to reach the goal.\n\nAction: Sell Constellation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"sell_joker\",\n  \"positions\": [4]\n}\n```\n\nOkay, the schema is clear.  `action` is \"sell\\_joker\", and `positions` is an array of integers that specifies which joker to sell.  The target is position 4 - the position of Constellation.\n\nNow, one last thing: the Blackboard and remaining hand. My current hand is a mix of Spades, Clubs, and a 5 of Diamonds, so Blackboard's multiplier is only going to trigger if all remaining cards are Spades/Clubs (I'm aiming for a Flush).\n\nFinal decision: Sell Constellation and then let's go play.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
