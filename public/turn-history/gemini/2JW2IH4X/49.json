{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Phase Decision-Making**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 7, the shop phase. I've got $9, and my hand is looking pretty good, but I need to optimize my next move. Let's see... I've got a decent Joker setup: Odd Todd for chips, a straightforward Multiplier Joker, Blackboard which will be great because my hand is Spades/Clubs, and Joker Stencil for the open slot multi, currently at X2. I'm maxed out on Jokers at 5, with 4 filled and 1 empty. My Telescope voucher is key here. It tells me that my most played hand is \"Flush\", at level 3, base 65 and mult of 8. I've played it 4 times.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see a few options. Earth for a Full House, The Chariot for Steel Cards (which I can't use *yet*, need to be in a round to use), and two Celestial Packs. My Telescope is making those Celestial Packs incredibly valuable because it *guarantees* me a Jupiter upgrade for my Flush!\n\nHere's my thought process. I could either:\n\n1.  **Buy a Celestial Pack:** I could buy the first one for $4. The Telescope confirms Jupiter, the Flush upgrade, is in there. This is in alignment with my strategy, consistent with upgrading the Flush from Level 3 to Level 4. I would then have $5 left.\n2.  **Buy both Celestial Packs:** After the first one, buy the second one. This gives me a chance to potentially upgrade the Flush *twice*. I'd be left with just $1, though, which is risky.\n3.  **Buy The Chariot:** I could purchase The Chariot for Steel Cards, but the card would go into inventory, and it is a bad choice for this round.\n4.  **Rearrange my Jokers:** The order I have them in right now, Odd Todd, Joker, Blackboard, Joker Stencil, works. My math shows the current order as good.\n\nIt's clear, buying a Celestial Pack is the most efficient use of my money, given the Telescope and my Flush focus. So, I will buy one Celestial Pack. My action is, `buy_booster 1`, position 1. And that's it. Time to execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
