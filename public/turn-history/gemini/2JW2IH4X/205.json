{"reasoning":"**Strategic Flush Assessment and Execution**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 8/8, goal is 75,000 chips – we're aiming big, so let's aim at a flush. Got a pretty decent hand here: Ace of Hearts (Glass, Wild, Odd), 7 of Clubs (Odd), 7 of Clubs (Odd), 8 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 5 of Spades (Odd), and 10 of Clubs. The jokers are: Odd Todd (good), Blackboard (potential for huge mult), Joker Stencil, and Constellation. Level 17 flush, base 275 chips, and 36x mult.\n\nNow, the plan: Blackboard triggers on Spades or Clubs *held* cards. The Ace is wild, which can count as any suit, so that's helpful. Gotta trigger Blackboard; it's too good to pass up. Looking at my options: A simple flush will do.\n\n*   **Option 1: Play a Flush with the Glass Ace (Spade):** Ace of Hearts (Wild), 8 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 5 of Spades. Remaining cards are Clubs, Blackboard activates, I will save the BlackBoard Multiplier by not including a Club card in the flush itself. The Blackboard is my key. A Flush will give us 275 base chips, plus rank bonus: the Ace is wild, counts as 11, the rest of the ranks add up to 38. That means 439 total chips. Odd Todd: the Ace and 5 in the hand. That is 62 chips. Blackboard (x3), Glass Ace (x2), Stencil (x2), and Constellation (x1) mult: that's 432x. Chips are 375 * 432 = 162,000, easy win.\n*   **Option 2: Flush w/o the Glass Ace (to save it for the Boss):** Not possible.\n\nRight, so Option 1 is looking good. The math checks out. I'm going with a flush. Let's make sure the suits are correct. AH (Wild), 8S, 8S, 6S, and 5S are a flush; and leaving 2C, 3C, and 8C in hand activates Blackboard. Yes. Blackboard triggers and gives me 3x. Stencil and Glass multiplier as well.\n\nLet's double-check the cards. Indices: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. \nCards: Ace of Hearts, 8 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 5 of Spades.\nBlackboard is good.\n\nI've got the flush, the math, and the indices. I'm going with: play, positions \\[1, 4, 5, 6, 7], hand is \"flush\", estimated 162,000 chips. And, yes, the `intended_hand_type` should be lowercase.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,6,7]"}
