{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Board and Strategizing the Play**\n\nOkay, so we're at Round 9, with the Boss Blind looming at 4000 chips. Gotta make some serious progress here. My hand size is reduced to 7, thanks to that Boss Effect. And I have just $2 in my pocket with zero chips. Need to get this right. The Jokers are in play: Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd cards like Ace, and...wait, is King odd? No, the list *explicitly* says A, 9, 7, 5, 3.), Swashbuckler (+9 Mult), Blackboard (x3 Mult if hand cards are Spades or Clubs), and Joker Stencil (x2 Mult per empty slot).\n\nLet's see what I'm working with. I've got an Ace of Spades, 4 of Spades, 6 of Hearts (ugh, not a good start), a King of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and a Queen of Diamonds. The goal is to maximize Blackboard and Stencil while going for a strong hand. Given my current hand, I have a few options. I'm thinking a Flush is the best way to go since I have some cards of the Clubs and Spades suit already. But I also need to satisfy Blackboard. So, get rid of the Hearts and Diamonds. I have to discard two cards.\n\nBut wait, if I discard just those two (6 of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds), I'll draw two new cards. So, I need to make sure I leave only Spades and Clubs in hand after playing. However, Blackboard checks *after* the hand is played. Okay, so I should see what cards I can hold after the hand is played.\n\nAlright, a Flush Level 5 is worth a base 95 Chips and a 12 Mult. That's a good target. I have 2 Spades and 3 Clubs. Discarding non-Spade/Clubs cards is my main move. Need a flush, and Blackboard at the same time. Ok, 6 of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds are out.\n\nI also have the option to discard the 4 of Spades and the 4 of Clubs. But do I want to? Might be helpful to find a flush.\n\nSo, here's my plan: Discard the 6 of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds. That leaves me with the cards needed for Blackboard. But the best outcome will be if I get a flush.\n\nI am *also* considering how the deck is constructed. There are 12 Hearts and Diamonds each. Given the odds, I am likely to draw more Hearts/Diamonds. So maybe I should just play a High Card or Pair now? Nope, still need to satisfy Blackboard. So I discard the Hearts/Diamonds.\n\nI need to get rid of Hearts/Diamonds: 6 of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds. But it might be smart to discard the 4s as well.\n\nI need to maximize the chances of a Blackboard-compatible hand. I have 4 discards in total. I can afford to be a bit aggressive here. I need to get rid of the Hearts and Diamonds: 6 of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds.\n\nActually, it seems like a flush is a good strategy here. If I discard 6 of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds, the hand level will not trigger Blackboard.\n\nLet's check \"Last Played Hands\". I've played a flush before. A Flush is the goal. I discard 6 of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds. And that would also allow Blackboard.\n\nIf I play a hand of 5 cards, I'll have 2 left over. Those are the ones that must be Spades/Clubs for Blackboard to kick in.\n\nI have 4 discards. I have to use them to set up a strong hand. So let's look at the cards again. Ace of Spades, 4 of Spades, 6 of Hearts, King of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds. If I discard the 6 of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds, the Blackboard *will* trigger.\n\nIf I play a hand of [6H, QD, 4S, 4C, JC], I can play it as a Pair of 4s. The remaining hand will be Ace of Spades, King of Clubs. Blackboard triggers. This gets me ~1,188. Not enough. I need a *Flush*. So I *have* to discard non-Spades/Clubs and find a Flush!\n\nLet's check the deck again. Diamonds: 12, Hearts: 12, Clubs: 10, Spades: 11. Discarding non-Spades/Clubs gives me ~46% for Sp\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,7]"}
