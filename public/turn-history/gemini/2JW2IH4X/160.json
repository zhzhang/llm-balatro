{"reasoning":"**The Psychic's Challenge**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in a tricky spot, a Blind Select against the Psychic, and I *must* play five cards. My primary objective remains to hit 70,000 chips. I have some interesting tools at my disposal: Odd Todd boosting odd cards, Swashbuckler adding Mult from selling the lower cards, Blackboard acting as a x3 multiplier for Spades/Clubs, and Stencil for x2 Mult. My cash situation is tight - only $5 at the moment.\n\nMy flush is at a solid level 16 with a 34 Mult, which gives me 260 chips. I'm thinking my winning strategy is to focus on making a Flush. Ideally, I'll load it up with odd cards to let Odd Todd do his thing. To make the most of it, I need to make sure the cards I *don't* play are Spades or Clubs to get the Blackboard bonus.\n\nThe only reasonable action right now is to play a round, so I'm calling it: `play_round`. My anticipated hand type will be a Flush, but I have no intention to say so explicitly. I'm estimating this Flush, with all my multipliers, should get me around 110,000 chips. The data is all clean - it's valid JSON, with the right formatting, and no unnecessary frills. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
