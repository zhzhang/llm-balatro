{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, so the ante is 3/8, round 7, and I have a dollar to play with, and I am in a Celestial Pack. My Joker setup is looking strong: Odd Todd, a straight +4 Multiplier Joker, Blackboard which will be a beast with Spades/Clubs, and a Joker Stencil that is currently x2. I have the Telescope voucher active, which, because of my gameplay, guarantees that the card related to my most played hand, a level 4 Flush, will appear. Currently, I haven't used any consumables, and I see three pack choices: Jupiter, Venus, and Mars.\n\nMy core strategy is clearly built around Flushes right now, especially with Blackboard's synergy with Spades and Clubs, so I'm focusing on scaling that. With the Telescope, Jupiter's the obvious choice. It gives +2 Multiplier and +15 chips. Venus isn't terrible but it levels up Three of a Kind, and Mars is all about Four of a Kind, which, while not useless, is not what I want.\n\nSo, the action is definitely a \"select\", and the target is position 1, Jupiter. No target cards are required.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [\n    1\n  ],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
