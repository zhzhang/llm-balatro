{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis: Ante 8, Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, final boss looming. I need to optimize this shop. I'm currently running a Flush build, Level 17, with Odd Todd providing flat chips, Blackboard (X3 Spades/Clubs), Joker Stencil (X2), and Constellation (X1.0, essentially inactive without planets). I have $7.\n\nThe key here is to leverage Blackboard and get Constellation online. Right now, Blackboard is the powerhouse, but its Spades/Clubs restriction requires deck management. Constellation *needs* planets to be active.\n\nLet's break down the shop options:\n\n*   **Cards:** Smiley Face is a non-starter; my hand relies on a specific rank, not face cards. Runner is useless for a Flush strategy.\n*   **Boosters:** Standard Pack *could* give me a Spade/Club for Blackboard or a useful enhanced card, but it's a gamble. The Jumbo Arcana Pack is where the real potential lies.\n*   **Vouchers:** Crystal Ball isn't in my budget.\n*   **Reroll:** Too risky with only $7.\n\nThe *Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6)* is the clear winner. It offers a 5-card pool that could provide:\n\n*   **Planets** for Constellation (High Priestess), making it a valuable multiplier\n*   **Tarot Cards** to manipulate the deck. The Sun, Moon, Star, or World tarot cards can help change cards to Spades/Clubs for Blackboard\n*   **Money or Steel/Glass** for future shop flexibility.\n\nThe Standard Pack is a distant second, not really providing direct value. Saving money for interest is a losing strategy, and a reroll is too risky.\n\n**Therefore, the optimal action is: buy\\_booster 2 (Jumbo Arcana Pack).** This maximizes my chances of finding cards that directly impact Blackboard's multiplier or kickstart Constellation. This is the final stretch; I need to take every advantage.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
