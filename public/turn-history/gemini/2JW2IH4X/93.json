{"reasoning":"**Prioritizing Blackboard and Flush Synergy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5, and the primary goal here is to maximize my score with this Flush-focused strategy, and leverage that juicy X3 multiplier from Blackboard. My hand is a bit mixed, with a lot of potential but a few red cards that are really cramping my style. I've got a solid set of Jokers: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard (the key one), and Joker Stencil. This TAROT_PACK is a Mega Arcana Pack, which is great because I get to choose two.\n\nLooking at the options, *The World* immediately jumps out. It's the most impactful for my current hand. Using it to convert those pesky red cards – the 10H, 8H, and 8D – into Spades is a game-changer. That directly enables Blackboard (which wants all Spades/Clubs) and improves the consistency of drawing useful cards for Flushes in the future.\n\n*The Hanged Man* is a solid second choice. Removing red cards is helpful for Blackboard, but *The World* does it *and* makes the hand viable *now*. *The Fool* repeating Jupiter (+2 Mult, +15 Chips) could be good, but not as good as *The World* is at enabling Blackboard right away. *High Priestess* is too random, and *Wheel of Fortune* is a gamble I don't need right now.\n\nSo, I'm leaning heavily towards *The World*. Let's execute. I'll make the first selection `select 2 3 4 8` to change those red cards to Spades.\n\nNow, a quick thought about *The Fool*: *The Fool* should copy the last *used* Tarot. The metadata says the last used was Jupiter, but that was from a previous shop/pack. If I pick *The World* and use it, it will count as the last one used, and then *The Fool* would copy *The World* which would be insane for fixing the deck. I'll need to check the exact behavior when the pack is opened, but the primary play is still `select 2 3 4 8`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,8]"}
