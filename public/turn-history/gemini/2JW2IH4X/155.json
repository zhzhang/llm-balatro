{"reasoning":"**Flush It! Time to Dominate This Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. The Big Blind is staring me down, and I've got a killer hand: a mix of Spades and Clubs, just what the doctor ordered. My head is already spinning, as I see a massive potential score building. I have a Flush on my mind, and I'm going to milk it for all it's worth.\n\nI've got a good hand - it is made up of a couple of low spades and a bunch of clubs. Here's how I see it:\n\n*   **Jokers:** Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Stencil. Those Jokers are key.\n*   **Blackboard:** This is my secret weapon. All the cards in my hand right now are Spades or Clubs. I've got to make sure the remaining cards after I play a hand are Spades or Clubs to keep the x3 multiplier going. This is the difference.\n*   **Flush:** A level 14 Flush is 230 chips with a 30x Multiplier. \n*   **Odd Todd:** I have A, 9, 5, 3 in hand, so this will be in play.\n*   **Swashbuckler:** I have 9x Multiplier for the value of the other Jokers.\n*   **Stencil:** Double the multiplier.\n*   **Money:** I need to build a massive score with $2 to spare!\n\nNow, the math. I need a Flush, and the odds are on my side with this hand. I'll need to calculate the value of each card and Joker to get a massive score. Here's my plan:\n\nI'm thinking, \"Should I go for the Jack?\" No, too high in the deck for the Odd Todd Joker. \n\"What's better, this pair or those?\" Oh. No. All the cards are Spades or Clubs so the x3 Blackboard effect will still be in play. \nI have a 14 Flush at a cost of 230/30 (Chips/Multiplier). So I can maximize Odd Todd. Let's see if this works.\n\nThe \"Ace of Clubs\" card: If I *hold* it, I get a Planet card at the end of the round. It's a level-up opportunity, so that's the final plan. I need a way to build a hand with all Clubs so I can make this Flush and get the planet card. The target of 52,500 should be easy. I can get about 90,000 using all the cards, Jokers and bonuses, so I should be set. I need to make sure to calculate this to secure this position.\n\nSo, I will play a hand with the: Jack, 10, 9, 5, and 3 of Clubs, since I have the Ace of Clubs. This keeps the Spades and Clubs in hand, so Blackboard works. This will keep the cards to a Club-only setup.\n\nLet's do this again:\n*   I want: AC, JC, 9C, 5C, 3C (4, 5, 6, 7, 8).\n\nThen I get:\n\n*   230 + (10+10+9+5+3) (Card Values) + 93 (Odd Todd) = 360 Chips.\n*   (30 + 9 Swash) \\* (3 Blackboard) \\* (2 Stencil) = 234.\n*   Total 360 \\* 234 = 84,240.\n\nI win!\n\nOkay, I have one more discard to get a better hand, but this is a *sure* win and gets me the best value. This also gives me a Planet card and $8. It all holds. Let's do this!\n\n*   **Final Action: `play [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`**\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
