{"reasoning":"**My Game Plan: Big Blind Blind Select**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Blind Select phase, specifically the Big Blind. Currently, I have $5 and my target chips for this round are 450. I'm rocking Odd Todd, which is going to be my key to easily beating this. Considering my Odd Todd joker, playing this round is a no-brainer.\n\nLet's break it down: A simple pair of odd cards gets me a massive chip boost and I'm practically guaranteed to hit well above the 450 threshold. A Flush with odd cards will be even bigger.\n\nNow, should I play or skip for the economy tag? If I play, I'll get the reward, $4, plus $1 in interest, for a total of $10. If I skip, the Economy tag would double my money, also to $10. Both options lead to the same amount of cash. But, playing offers a shop visit, and shops are *crucial* early on to snag Mult jokers or better economy options.\n\nSo, it's clear: playing is strictly better. I get the same financial outcome and a shop visit.\n\nThe decision is to use the `play_round` action. This doesn't require positions, hand type, or chips in this blind select phase, so those will be null. The `estimated_chips` isn't relevant yet.\n\nSo, I'm going to take the `play_round` action, because it's the right choice.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
