{"reasoning":"**My Critical Decision: Maximize Ante 8**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 8, the final Ante. I have a solid build going: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard (spades/clubs), and a Joker Stencil. My Flush is at level 16, which is pretty significant. Recent performance shows I can comfortably score around 138k with Blackboard active, when I needed 70k, so I'm well ahead of the curve. My money is $14.\n\nI'm staring at these shop items and the Hieroglyph voucher. The Family is useless. Drunkard could help with the Blackboard setup, and is cheap. Jumbo Arcana Pack has the highest ceiling and could give Temperance, Strength/Death (spades/clubs), or Jupiter (for even bigger flush) or other useful cards. Standard Pack is a gamble.\n\nThe Hieroglyph voucher is *tempting*. It drops me back to Ante 7, which gives me more time to scale. But I'm already at Ante 8. Using it would mean I'd have to play through both Ante 7 and Ante 8 again! The question then becomes: is the added risk of more rounds vs the potential to better scale my build worth it, when I'm already winning comfortably? The answer is probably no.\n\nDrunkard and Jumbo Arcana are doable. Jumbo Arcana has the highest ceiling. If I buy it I have $8. Then Drunkard is only $4.\n\nThen there's the Telescope Voucher! That means Celestial packs will give me Jupiter.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'm going to buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack. It's the most likely way to improve the deck right now. I'll need to see what I get and adjust my strategy from there. I have confidence in this run. I'm going to maximize my focus on this current Ante and get this win.\n\nMy decision is: `buy_booster`, position 1 (Jumbo Arcana Pack).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
