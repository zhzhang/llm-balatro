{"reasoning":"**Analysis of a Tight Spot**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 8/8, Round 22, and I'm in the Shop phase after playing a Tarot card from a Jumbo Arcana Pack. I'm down to my last dollar – that's the rub. My current Jokers are Odd Todd, Blackboard, Joker Stencil, and Constellation. My vouchers are Telescope and Hieroglyph, and my strongest hand is a Flush at Level 17, which nets me 275 chips and a 36x multiplier. My goal? Beat the Boss Blind of Ante 8, which I should be able to do with my existing setup.\n\nLooking at the shop, a Smiley Face card costs $4, a Runner card is $5, a Standard Pack is $4, and a Crystal Ball voucher is a hefty $10. Forget about rerolling; that's $5. I can't afford anything. My build is working pretty well.\n\nSince I have no money, no consumables to use or sell, and no compelling reason to sell Jokers just to buy something else in the shop, I need to focus on what I *can* do. The only free action available is to proceed to the next round. Selling my Jokers would significantly weaken my deck.\n\nBefore I go, though, let's just double-check the Joker order. Odd Todd is on the left, which is good since it's a chip booster that is applied before the mult calculations. Blackboard, Stencil, and Constellation are all multiplicative, so their order doesn't matter (multiplication is commutative). It's all about making sure my Spades/Clubs count for Blackboard. Given that, I should be good to go.\n\nAlright, action: `round_select`. Let's get to it.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
