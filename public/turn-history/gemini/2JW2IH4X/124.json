{"reasoning":"**Strategic Decision: Ante 6, Round 13**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. We're at Ante 6, Round 13, aiming to conquer the game by reaching Ante 8. The current build leans heavily on Flush synergies, specifically a Level 12 Flush, with the core strategy being centered around the Blackboard Joker. The Blackboard Joker is a game-changer with its x3 multiplier, but only if the hand is comprised solely of Spades or Clubs. We also have Odd Todd for odd cards, Swashbuckler for Joker sell value, and Joker Stencil for multiplier per empty slot (currently x2).\n\nWe have $5 to work with, and the shop presents some interesting options: Pluto ($3, High Card level up) is not crucial at this time. Lusty Joker ($5, Heart synergy) is off the table, as it directly conflicts with the Blackboard strategy. The *Arcana Pack* ($4, Deck modification) is the clear frontrunner. It's a high-priority purchase because it will improve Blackboard consistency by either converting Hearts/Diamonds to Spades/Clubs or removing them altogether. Reroll Surplus ($10) is too expensive, and a regular Reroll ($5) seems less valuable than the Arcana Pack in this situation.\n\nMy initial thoughts are, use the $5 wisely. The Arcana Pack is a direct enabler for our primary multiplier. The Blackboard Joker is the keystone, and improving its consistency is paramount. Buying the Arcana Pack leaves us with a measly $1, which is not ideal since it negates the interest gain, but the deck manipulation is absolutely worth more than the $1.\n\nThe buy operation is: `buy_booster 1`, where position 1 is the *Arcana Pack*. After double-checking the shop information, I've confirmed that the Arcana Pack is indeed at position 1.\n\nBefore I commit, I double-check the Joker order. My thinking is: Chips, Mult, xMult, xMult. It is already perfectly ordered, so no Joker rearrangements are needed. The multipliers are calculated as: (Base + 9) * 3 * 2. \n\n**Decision:** I am buying the *Arcana Pack*. This is the optimal play for the current state of the game.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
