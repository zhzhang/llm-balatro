Ante is 1, Round 1 (Small Blind). The immediate objective is to hit 300 chips. I have $4, four cards left, no jokers, no consumables. My initial hand has a solid foundation, let's see:\\n\\nI've got a King of Hearts, a 10 of Hearts, a 5 of Hearts, and a 2 of Hearts \\u2013 that's 4 hearts, which is promising for a flush.  I also have pairs: Jacks, 10s, and 2s.  No immediate straights, but a potential flush is definitely on the radar.\\n\\nPlaying a Two Pair (Jacks and 10s) gets me 120 chips (20 base * 2 mult + 40 from cards), which isn't bad. However, I need 180 more chips after playing this hand if I choose to go the Two Pair route. A Flush could almost get me there in one shot (potentially 280), and a Full House would outright win (320).\\n\\nSince I have four discards, the best strategy, in my view, is to hunt for a stronger hand. Discarding the non-flush cards (Jack of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, and 10 of Diamonds) gives me a good chance to draw the missing heart for a flush. I am looking for the remaining Heart, and I still have 3 hands to go, so the discard to get a better hand is the most efficient.\\n\\nSo, the action is definitely to \\\"discard\\\" the Jack of Clubs (position 5), 2 of Clubs (position 6), Jack of Diamonds (position 7), and the 10 of Diamonds (position 8). The strategy is set. Let's see what the draw brings!\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 5 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 3]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 5 of Spades.

I'm looking at my hand: 5 of Spades, 2 of Spades, King of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 6 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds.\\n\\nImmediately, I'm spotting some potential. I've got a couple of pairs - 5s and 2s. I'm also seeing a flush opportunity with four Hearts. The question is, which play offers the best path to 300 chips?\\n\\nIf I go for the Two Pair now, it's: (20 + 5+5+2+2+10) * 2 = 88 chips. Still, the goal is 300.\\n\\nHowever, the flush could be a bigger payout. I need one more heart.  The odds seem pretty good; there are 9 hearts left in the 40-card deck.  I calculated about a 67% chance to get the flush. If I hit the flush, that's roughly (35 + 10+10+5+2+8) * 4 = 280 chips (assuming a high card fill). Getting the flush would leave me close to the 300 target.\\n\\nI've got three discards, so this is crucial.  Should I play the guaranteed chips now, or take the gamble for the flush? My instinct says to discard to chase the flush.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to discard the non-hearts: the 5 of Spades, 2 of Spades, 6 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds. I'll keep the Hearts.\\n\\nOkay, let's write out the JSON.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"action\\\": \\\"discard\\\",\\n  \\\"positions\\\": [1, 2, 7, 8],\\n  \\\"intended_hand_type\\\": null,\\n  \\\"estimated_chips\\\": null\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis is the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: King of Hearts.

I've got a hand with a Heart Flush \\u2013 King, Queen, 10, 5, and 2.  That's a pretty solid starting point. With a base of 35 chips and a multiplier of 4, plus the card values totaling 37 chips, I'm looking at a payout of (35 + 37) * 4 = 288 chips from the flush.\\n\\nI need only 12 more chips to reach the 300 chip target after this hand. I have three hands remaining and two discards, but that's a small price for a near certain 96% return of this investment in the flush. I would quickly be able to reach the target with the remaining hands.\\n\\nI could have two pair, with Kings and Queens, which would give me 120. That's not close. Discarding to aim for a better Flush or even a Straight Flush is tempting, but with the Flush being so close, and having remaining hands, it's not worth the risk. A single High Card will easily finish off the goal after playing the Flush.\\n\\nLet's do a quick calculation of the chip values for cards: 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 2 = 37. Yes, (35 + 37) * 4 is indeed 288. It's the strongest play.\\n\\nI also have to check my hand positions to verify again. King, Queen, 10, 5, 2 in positions 1 through 5, correct.\\n\\nThe payoff difference between two hands and one hand is only $1. It's not worth the risk to not play the flush.\\n\\nFinal decision: I'm playing the Heart Flush. I'm going to enter the following action: \\\"play\\\", Positions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], intending a hand of \\\"flush\\\", with an estimated chip return of 288.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 5 flush 288\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Queen of Spades.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nplay <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Play the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may play up to 5 cards at a time. If you play a hand, you must also respond with the intended hand type you think you are playing, and an estimate of the number of chips you think you will earn from the hand. Use the results of previous hands played to inform your estimate.\\ndiscard <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Discard the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may discard up to 5 cards at a time.\\nrearrange_hand <card1> <card2> ... <cardN> - Rearrange the hand of cards.

  "reasoning": "**The Optimal Play: A High Card Victory**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the small blind with a target of 300 chips and currently at 288. I need just 12 more chips to meet the goal. I have three hands left and two discards available. I also have $4. Looking at my current hand, I see a King of Diamonds, two Queens, a 7, a 6, a 3, and a 5.\n\nMy options are pretty straightforward. I can play the King of Diamonds as a high card, or I can use the pair of Queens. The High Card play is simpler, and it looks like it will get the job done.\n\nLet's do the math. The high card has a base of 5 chips with a multiplier of 1. The King is worth 10 chips, so I expect a total of (5 + 10) * 1 = 15 chips. That's more than enough. 288 + 15 gets me to 303. No need to overcomplicate things. I can play up to 5 cards, but playing more is unnecessary when I can meet the target with just one. Even the Queen pair would be excessive. I'm going with the King of Diamonds.\n\nSo the action is \"play\", position [7], \"high card\" type and a 15 chip estimation. I double checked the calculation. It's spot on. The King is my play!\n\n\n"
