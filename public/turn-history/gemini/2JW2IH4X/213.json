{"reasoning":"**Round Selection Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 22. The game step is currently at BLIND\\_SELECT, specifically the Boss Blind. My goal remains 100,000 chips. The Boss is Verdant Leaf, which *should* have been dealt with - it states \"All cards debuffed until 1 Joker sold,\" which I've already done! I sold Constellation in the previous step and the game confirms it's gone. Even if the Boss text isn't updated in real time, the game mechanics should now reflect this.\n\nI have $4 in the bank and a Telescope and Hieroglyph voucher. My current Joker setup is Odd Todd in position 1, providing +31 Chips for odd rank cards. BlackBoard is in position 2, granting X3 Mult if all cards are Spades or Clubs. Joker Stencil sits in position 3, providing X1 Mult for each empty Joker slot, giving me a current X3 Mult, because I have 3 jokers. I think the current setup is optimal for the moment, additive before multiplicative, but I should double check.\n\nLooking at the current state, the command 'play\\_round' is available, which is exactly what I need. My intended hand type for this round is a flush, based on previous level 17 stats. Given previous flush scores and this new Stencil X3 multiplier, I expect an even higher score this time.\n\nThe schema requires a JSON with `action`, `positions`, `intended_hand_type`, and `estimated_chips`. Since I'm initiating the round, `play_round` corresponds to `round_select` in the logic. Therefore, I need to select the round. This means the intended hand and estimated chips don't matter *yet*.\n\nSo the JSON structure should be:\n*   `action`: \"play\\_round\"\n*   `positions`: null\n*   `intended_hand_type`: null\n*   `estimated_chips`: null\n\nBefore proceeding, I should double check my Joker positioning. Odd Todd, BlackBoard, and Joker Stencil. Odd Todd gives +Chips, so good. BlackBoard is X3 Mult if all Spades or Clubs, and Joker Stencil is a multiplicative. This looks correct. The current state is `BLIND_SELECT`, and the next logical step is to play the round, so I'm confirming that my final action is `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
