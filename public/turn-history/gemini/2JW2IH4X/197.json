{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy for Ante 8: Prioritizing Deck Optimization and Potential Constellation Scaling**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. It's Ante 8, and I've got $9. My primary goal is to beat the Big Blind and the Boss Blind, and I've got a decent setup: Odd Todd for odd ranks, Blackboard for Spades/Clubs, Stencil for mult, and Constellation that I'm hoping to scale, but is currently at only X1.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on getting Blackboard online. The deck is mostly Spades and Clubs, but there are enough Hearts and Diamonds to throw it off. Death, a Tarot card in the shop, is key here. It allows me to convert unwanted cards into Spades or Clubs. The Hanged Man is also there, which would let me remove the non-Spade/Clubs, but I think Death offers better long-term consistency. Both Death and Hanged Man cost $3 each, but I can only hold two consumables.\n\nHowever, since I want to scale my Constellation Joker, the Arcana Pack for $4 seems more promising because I might get a Planet card. I can immediately use the booster and select the best card for me. The pack would provide deck manipulation or Planet cards, boosting Constellation.\n\nHere's the breakdown: I have $9.\n\n*   Buying Death is extremely good to make sure that Blackboard triggers every hand.\n*   The Arcana Pack costs $4. If I find a Planet, my Constellation will scale.\n\nGiven the options, I'll buy the Arcana Pack first to try and scale the Constellation Joker. This is the optimal step. I'm choosing `buy_booster 1` for the Arcana Pack to give myself the best chance to get Planet cards. I can buy Death with the remaining money, but the *immediate* action to take is to go for the best potential upside from the Arcana pack. The Arcana Pack will give me an immediate choice between cards, and I can choose what is best to make it scale to late-game.\n\nFinal Action: `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
