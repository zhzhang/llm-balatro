{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis for Optimal Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 8, aiming for 75,000 chips. Got 312 right now, and two hands left. Need a big score, quickly. Looking at my hand, I see a strong play. It's a flush, all Clubs: Ace, 10, 9, 7, 7. This is the optimal play, I'm sure of it.\n\nI've got a killer set of Jokers: Odd Todd (good for the odd ranks), Blackboard (x3 mult for all Spades/Clubs held), Joker Stencil (x2 mult), and Constellation (x1 mult). The Blackboard is definitely going to boost this hand.\n\nI've calculated the chips already: 275 base for the flush at level 17. The ranks: Ace (11), 10 (10), 9 (9), 7 (7), 7 (7), that gives us a score of 44. I've got four odd cards here (Ace, 9, and two 7s) being played, which gets me an extra 124 chips from Odd Todd (4 * 31 = 124). So the total chip count is 443 (275 + 44 + 124).\n\nThe Mult is going to be 36 from the base flush. Then, Blackboard is x3 (since I'm holding Spades - which meets the criteria). And Stencil is currently x2. Constellation is x1. So, the total multiplier is 216 (36 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1).\n\nIf I play this flush of Clubs (Ace, 10, 9, 7, 7), my total score will be 443 * 216 = 95,688 chips. Well over the goal!\n\nI double-checked everything: the Ace of Clubs description says it should create the Planet card at the end if I *hold* it in my hand. But, I don't need it at this stage. I need to win and go to the shop/boss. The planet can come later.\n\nThe final calculation uses positions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The hand is a flush and I have confirmed the number of odd cards I'll be playing (4). The held cards (King and two 7s of Spades) activate the Blackboard Joker. The Stencil is indeed x2 (5 total spots, 4 Jokers, +1 because of Stencil itself).\n\n**Action: Play the flush (Ace, 10, 9, 7, 7), from indices 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, for 95,688 chips.**\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
