{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shopping: A Deep Dive into Joker Optimization**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 7/8, SHOP phase, a measly $2 in my pocket, but thankfully the Credit Card Joker gives me a -$20 cushion. The current setup is: Odd Todd, Blackboard (Spades/Clubs x3), Joker Stencil (x2), and the Credit Card. My initial thought is to maximize my score in this ante. My Level 17 Flush strategy is the key here.\n\nI'm focused on optimizing my Jokers. I know Constellation is $6 and Justice is $3. I can buy Constellation and still have -$4, which the Credit Card allows. My immediate plan is to buy Constellation. My previous logic was: buy Constellation, *then* sell the Credit Card. This is a critical point.\n\nHere's the rub: Joker Stencil's multiplier depends on the number of filled slots. Currently, it's x2 (4/5 slots filled). If I buy Constellation, it'll be x1 (5/5 filled). My end goal, the ideal state, would be Odd Todd, Blackboard (x3), Joker Stencil (x2), and a Constellation. I know Constellation starts at x1, but I believe the use of Telescope and Level 17 Flush will give me Jupiter often.\n\nRight, so to get this, I need to buy Constellation, that's position `2`, and the command I'll use is `buy_card 2`. This takes my money to -$4, but the Credit Card handles that.\n\nOkay, let's step back and consider some alternatives. Should I buy Justice first? No, Justice is better used for specific rounds and isn't the priority here. Should I sell the Credit Card first? No, I need it to buy Constellation.\n\nNow, I'm just confirming that I can buy Constellation given my inventory. I have 4 Jokers, buying this would be 5 and that is allowed. So, the action is `buy_card` at position `2` (Constellation).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
