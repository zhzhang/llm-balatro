{"reasoning":"**Analysis of Current Balatro State**\n\nOkay, let's take a look at this round. The ante is at 6/8, and this is round 14. I've got nothing in the bank—zero dollars—and no booster packs left. The immediate goal is to win the upcoming boss blind, \"The Head\", which debuffs Hearts, but that's not going to affect my build since I'm running Clubs and Spades for Blackboard.\n\nMy joker setup is the core of this strategy. I've got Odd Todd adding chips, Swashbuckler boosting the Mult, Blackboard tripling it for Clubs/Spades, and Joker Stencil acting as an independent xMult. No immediate shop actions are available.\n\nSince I can't buy anything in the shop, my main focus is optimization. Let's make sure the joker arrangement is ideal. Odd Todd, then Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and finally Joker Stencil, maximizing the bonus from all of them. The priority is to get +Mult before xMults.\n\nI've already verified that the order of the xMult jokers (Blackboard, Joker Stencil) doesn't matter, as multiplication is commutative. The positioning of the +Mult (Swashbuckler) to the left of the xMult jokers is critical to maximizing the score. That is already the case.\n\nThe Telescope voucher gives me the Planet pack of the most played hand, which is helpful.\n\nNow, should I sell any jokers? Selling Odd Todd would give me $2, but the +31 chip bonus per odd card is too valuable for the build I have right now. Plus, I still wouldn't be able to buy anything with $2. Swashbuckler would give me $2 as well, and if sold, would give Joker Stencil +1 multiplier. However, I have no reason to sell it now. I can sell during the round if needed. I should hold on to the joker to keep my options open.\n\nMy shop actions are exhausted. Time to proceed to the round selection.\n\nNo need to rearrange the jokers. Chips from cards, then Odd Todd chips, then Base Mult -> +Mult -> xMult. I've double-checked the scoring order.\n\nEverything looks correct. Let's move on.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
