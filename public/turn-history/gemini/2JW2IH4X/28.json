{"reasoning":"**Booster Pack Decision: Uranus is the Way**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 2, Round 4, deep in this Celestial Pack. Gotta beat this game, right? $8 in the bank. Got Odd Todd and Joker, plus the Blackboard – that's the key right now, gotta maximize that x3 Spades/Clubs Mult. My Flush is already Level 2, so that's good.\n\nI have three options for booster packs: Uranus, Mars, and Pluto. It's a tough call, but here's where my expertise kicks in. I need consistency and synergy with my current build, which is centered around Odd Todd and Blackboard.\n\nMars is a Four of a Kind upgrade, but that's too reliant on luck. High Card (Pluto) is useful for Blackboard, but leveling it here is weak. The last hand I played was a Two Pair, and Two Pair upgrades (Uranus) are a reliable fallback, given my strategy of clearing the red cards to trigger Blackboard. Two Pair only uses 4 cards, so I can ensure the 4 remaining cards are Spades/Clubs. I'm thinking about maximizing those x3 multipliers as well.\n\nGiven that my last play was Two Pair, and the need to manage Blackboard, Uranus (Two Pair) is probably the most consistent choice. I can always fish for other hands while utilizing Blackboard.\n\nSo, yeah, it's gotta be Uranus.\n\nOkay, let's look at the schema: \"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]\".\n\nRight, no need to skip, no reason to rearrange, just picking the best planet. \"select 1\".\n\nOne more check of the \"select\" description... yep, no card targets needed. \"select 1.\"\n\nWait...let me make absolutely sure about this schema. It's \"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]\".\n\nOkay, one more double check: Uranus (Two Pair) is consistently the best value upgrade here among the three. Four of a Kind is too rare. High Card is too weak even at Level 2.\n\nAnd yes, I did play a Two Pair last hand. Alright, execute the select action. I'm going with \"select\" and positions [1].\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
