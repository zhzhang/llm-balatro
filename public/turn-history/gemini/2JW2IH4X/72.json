{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop: A Blackboard Flush Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4, Round 9 with $10. Shop phase. My current build is centered around a Level 5 Flush, amplified by Blackboard (x3 Mult for Spades/Clubs), Joker Stencil (x2 Mult due to one empty slot), Odd Todd (+31 Chips for odd ranks), and Swashbuckler (+9 Mult, based on the sell value of my other Jokers). My goal is to maximize my score to beat higher Ante blinds. The Telescope voucher is solid for a Flush focus.\n\nRight now, the most crucial thing is maintaining that Blackboard multiplier, meaning I need to prioritize Spades and Clubs in my hand. Joker Stencil's x2 multiplier is significant, so I need to carefully consider anything that affects it. I need to make sure I am not missing any math.\n\nThe shop presents some interesting choices.\n\n*   Smiley Face is out, it boosts face cards which isn't the current strategy.\n\n*   Blue Joker is tempting (+2 Chips per card in deck, potentially a huge chip boost, +104 chips). BUT, it would knock Stencil down to x1, and I'm not certain that is a good trade. The current calculation is: (Base + Todd) * (Base + Swash + etc) * Stencil (2) * Blackboard (3) vs. (Base + Todd + 104) * (Base + Swash + etc) * Stencil (1) * Blackboard (3). Losing that x2 Mult for +104 chips is likely a bad trade unless base chips are very low.\n\n*   Standard Pack: Okay, looking for Spades/Clubs or high/odd rank cards.\n\n*   Arcana Pack: High priority! This is where I can find suits for Blackboard, enhancements like Mult/Glass to boost my score, or potentially find Hermit to build up some money.\n\n*   Seed Money: Long-term value, but I only have $10 now. This would mean 0$, and losing the interest from having money.\n\nSo, the play is: I have $10. Arcana Pack and Standard Pack are both $4. Buying the Arcana Pack first keeps me at $6, allowing for potentially another purchase and more importantly, interest on my money. I'm going to buy the Arcana Pack to see if I can improve the Blackboard or Flush strategy. The \"buy\\_booster\" command specifies position 2 for the Arcana Pack.\n\nBefore I commit, let's look again at that Blue Joker. Odd Todd is +31 per card, so maybe +62 or +93 in a flush. Blue Joker is +104 flat. But, again, it kills Stencil, which is a x2 multiplier. Swashbuckler will change if Blue Joker is bought. Currently at +9, based on sell value of the current Jokers (2+3+4). Buying Blue Joker, the sell value of Blue Joker is $2, so Swashbuckler becomes +11 (2+3+4+2). I need to maintain the empty Stencil slot, as it will affect my mult. Unless the next Joker is at least a x2, or provides additional scoring.\n\nAlright, I'm sticking with the Arcana Pack. Time to see what tarot cards I can find to support my Blackboard Flush.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
