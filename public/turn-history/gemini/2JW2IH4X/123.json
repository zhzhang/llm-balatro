{"reasoning":"**Current Balatro Play - Planet Pack Decision**\n\nOkay, I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` phase of this Balatro run. Let's see... my inventory is pretty standard at this point – got Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil, all good, solid Jokers. No consumables yet, and the Telescope voucher is set up for guaranteed Jupiter access. I'm focusing on a Flush build, heavily leaning into Spades and Clubs for that sweet Blackboard synergy – x3 multiplier is too good to pass up.\n\nCurrently, I have $5 left. My Flush is already at level 11, giving it a solid base. The current pack options are: Jupiter (Flush), Venus (Three of a Kind), and Mars (Four of a Kind).\n\nGiven the Flush focus, Jupiter is the clear choice here. I need to keep that Flush scaling up, so selecting Jupiter is the next logical step. After this pack, I'll need to see if an Arcana pack is available, but that is secondary.\n\nSo, the action is `select 1` (Jupiter).\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
