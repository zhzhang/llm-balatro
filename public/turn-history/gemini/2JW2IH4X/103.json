{"reasoning":"**My Assessment of the Situation: Ready to Face the Boss!**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. We're in Round 11, the ante is at 5/8, and the Boss Blind requires a hefty 44,000 chips. My current bankroll is only $6 – we're relying entirely on our cards and Jokers. I need to make sure I beat that blind!\n\nHere's my setup: I'm holding Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I’ve skipped the big blind for a Spectral Pack, and used Cryptid to duplicate the Ace of Spades. My Flush is leveled up to 9, giving me 155 chips and a x20 multiplier.\n\nThe strategy is clear: focus on Flushes, and leverage the Jokers in the right order.\n\nI've got the Jokers arranged in what I believe is the mathematically optimal sequence. Odd Todd will sit first to add chips for odd ranks. Next, Swashbuckler will provide a +9 multiplier to add to any base multiplier from hands played, which is ideal coming after the chip additions. Then, Blackboard, which relies on holding Spades or Clubs, should go in the third slot. Finally, Joker Stencil, which is the last joker with an empty slot, gets the final position with a x2 multiplier.\n\nThere's nothing to change here! No consumables to use, no compelling reason to sell a Joker at this stage. My Joker positioning is ideal, it’s a standard chips, +mult, xmult, xmult set up.\n\nTherefore, the only viable action is to `play_round`. My response will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"play_round\"}\n```\nLet’s do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
