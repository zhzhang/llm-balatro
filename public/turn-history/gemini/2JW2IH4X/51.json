{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop - A Strategic Focus on Scaling**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. We're in Ante 3, Round 7, fresh out of the shop after using a Jupiter card. I've got $5 left, which is the key here. My Joker lineup is decent: Odd Todd, a generic +4 Mult, Blackboard (potential x3 Mult for Spades/Clubs), and a Joker Stencil (x2 Mult because I have one open slot). Telescope is my voucher, which is golden since it guarantees another Jupiter card in the Celestial Pack. My Flush is already Level 4, so it's starting to really scale.\n\nLooking at the shop, Earth ($3) upgrades Full House, The Chariot ($3) gives a Steel card enhancement, and there's a Celestial Pack for $4. Reroll costs $5 – forget that!\n\nNow, the math is simple. I can *guarantee* another Jupiter card by buying the Celestial Pack. I have the Telescope voucher, so it's a no-brainer. The Chariot and Earth are nice but not as valuable as leveling my Flush. Given the flush, with this deck, I should be looking to maximize the number of flushes.\n\nBuying the Celestial Pack (Action: `buy_booster`, Position: 1) is the most powerful move. It's a clear winner over other options. Upgrading Flush to Level 5 is the optimal scaling move. It seems clear that the next step should be buying the booster, since I have the money and the voucher.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
