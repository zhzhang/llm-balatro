{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Tarot Pack**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 9, Ante 4/8. I'm staring down the Arcana Pack. Right now, I've got a measly $6 in the bank. My inventory's decent: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, Joker Stencil, and a Telescope voucher. My hand? 7S, 9H, 7H, 4H, 10C, 9C, KD, QD.\n\nThe goal is to pick from the Arcana Pack. I have three choices: The Hermit, Strength, and The Wheel of Fortune.\n\n*   **The Hermit:** Doubles my money, maxing at $20. Currently, that's a straight $6 gain, taking me to $12. Seems safe.\n*   **Strength:** Increases the rank of two cards by one. Tempting, but let's see... the hand has some odd ranks I could try to turn into something better.\n*   **The Wheel of Fortune:** A 25% gamble for a Foil/Holo/Poly on a Joker. High variance, which is exciting if it hits, but risky with such little money.\n\n*   **Blackboard Strategy:** I need all Spades or Clubs in my hand to trigger Blackboard (x3 mult). That's a key consideration.\n*   **Odd Todd Strategy:** Bonus chips for playing odd ranks (A, 9, 7, 5, 3).\n*   **Flush Strategy:** Flush gives 95 chips and 12 mult.\n*   **Money:** At $6, Hermit gets me to $12. Otherwise, I stay at $6.\n\nLet's dive deeper. Strength could turn a King or Queen into an Ace or a King, but these changes would not benefit Blackboard. So, it's not ideal for the hand. Wheel of Fortune is a real gamble.\n\nNow I'm evaluating: Hermit, is the safe play and gets me to $12. Strength doesn't significantly help. The Wheel of Fortune is a risk.\n\nRe-evaluating the hand: 7S, 9H, 7H, 4H, 10C, 9C, KD, QD.\nIf I use Strength:\nKD -> AD. QD -> KD. Strength does not solve my need for Spades/Clubs for Blackboard.\n\nSo, Hermit seems like the clear winner:\n$6 -> $12.\nI could buy the Standard Pack ($4) if it's still available, leaving me with $8. Or I can just leave with $12 to earn interest.\n\n**Action: I'm selecting The Hermit (Position 1). No targets are needed.**\n\nWait, confirming the command structure. `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1>...`\nHermit is at position 1. No targets.\n\nCommand: `select 1`\n\nLet's do a final review: Wheel of Fortune offers a potential permanent buff, but my economy needs a solid boost. With Joker Stencil and Blackboard, a Polychrome/Holographic hit would be massive, but I have to weigh the risk. Getting to $12 (Hermit) is a sure thing and sets me up for future gains.\n\nStrength again:\nCards: 7S, 9H, 7H, 4H, 10C, 9C, KD, QD.\nUsing Strength makes cards even, losing Odd Todd synergy.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Hermit is the most consistent and beneficial value, building economy and providing future options.\n\nNow I'm checking the output format.\n\nJSON Structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
