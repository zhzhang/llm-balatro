{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Tarot Pack: A Strategic Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the Tarot Pack phase, and I need to make some key decisions. My Ante is at 7/8, and I'm currently down $6 – money's tight, which means I need to optimize for consistent scoring. My hand is a promising Flush setup with a few hitches: I have the Ace, King, Queen, and Ten of Spades, plus a Five and a Three, but also a Jack of Hearts and a Queen of Diamonds. I'm aiming for a big score to beat the Boss, who forces a card selection, so I need a robust strategy.\n\nMy Jokers are Odd Todd, Blackboard (which provides a huge x3 Mult *if all cards in hand are Spades or Clubs*), Joker Stencil, and Constellation. The consumable is Justice. My initial thought is a Flush focus, specifically Level 17 Flushes, but the Blackboard condition is my immediate concern. The Jack of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds need to go, or be changed.\n\nThe Mega Arcana pack choices are: Wheel of Fortune, The Empress, Death, The Tower, and The Devil. I need to figure out which two options give me the best chance.\n\n*   *Wheel of Fortune*: It's tempting for a potential Joker buff (Foil, Holo, Poly), but it's a gamble.\n*   *The Empress*: +4 Mult is okay, but doesn't solve my suit problem.\n*   *Death*: **This is the key.** I can convert a card into another. This is perfect for transforming the Queen of Diamonds into a Spade, activating Blackboard, and strengthening future Flushes.\n*   *The Tower*: Stone card removes rank/suit. Doesn't help Blackboard.\n*   *The Devil*: Gold card. I need the money but not at the expense of blackboard.\n\nMy plan is now becoming clear: Use Death to convert the Queen of Diamonds into a Spade. This should trigger Blackboard, providing that x3 Mult boost. I also need to position the cards correctly for the conversion, ensuring the \"left\" card becomes the \"right\" card. This requires a hand rearrangement. And with a card always selected by the boss, my hand is bound to include QD or JH, making the switch even more important.\n\nTo make Death work, I'll rearrange my hand so that the Queen of Diamonds (which I *want* to convert) is at the leftmost available position, and the Ace of Spades (which I want to convert the QD *into*) is at position 2, as the game's UI works. Since the cards are in positions 1 to 8, with 1 being the \"leftmost\", I'll move the Queen of Diamonds (at position 8) to position 1, shifting the others over.\n\nSpecifically, I’m planning:\n1.  **`rearrange_hand 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`** to put the Queen of Diamonds at the start.\n2.  Then, in the next action, the `select Death` command using `select 3 1 2`, for which the digital game prompt will say: \"Select 2 cards, convert the left card into the right card (Drag to rearrange)\".\n\nThe alternative, the Wheel of Fortune, could provide a strong buff. The 25% chance of a good effect is intriguing. I would like a Joker buff, but a guaranteed card switch is my priority.\n\nI re-evaluate:\n*The Empress*: Not very helpful to me.\n*The Tower*: It’s out, stone cards won’t help the blackboard.\n*The Devil*: Not very helpful.\n\nI confirm that Odd Todd gets a bonus from the odd-ranked cards I’ll have in hand and converting the Queen of Diamonds is a net benefit.\n\nThe current \"action\" is to rearrange the hand: `rearrange_hand 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`.\nThis rearranges the order so I can perform the planned conversion.\n\nFinal actions:\n1. Rearrange: `rearrange_hand 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`.\n2. Use Death (later), converting Queen of Diamonds to Ace of Spades (if it is selected), and second, Wheel of Fortune, or another option.\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_hand\"\nPositions: [8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]"}
