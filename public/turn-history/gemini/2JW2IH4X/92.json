{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy for Ante 5**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5, Round 11, with $14. The goal is to reach Ante 8. My current strategy revolves around Flushes, leaning heavily on Blackboard for a juicy X3 multiplier if I can get a hand of all Spades or Clubs. I've got a decent setup with Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil (X2 Multiplier). Telescope is my Voucher; it'll help me land those Flushes.\n\nThe shop has some interesting options. Smeared Joker is tempting because it makes Flushes much easier to form by treating Hearts and Diamonds as the same suit, and Spades and Clubs as the same suit. But wait... Blackboard says \"if all cards held in hand are Spades or Clubs\". Smeared Joker *does not* actually change the suit of the card, it just changes how they are counted for *making* flushes, so it won't actually help Blackboard. Furthermore, if I get it, I fill my last Joker slot, making Joker Stencil effectively useless (X1 multiplier instead of X2).\n\nUranus is out – I don't play Two Pair. Seed Money is good long-term, but I need immediate impact, and $10 is too much for me now. A Standard Pack is usually low priority unless I need something specific.\n\nHowever, the Mega Arcana Pack at $8 is very intriguing. Those Tarot cards are my ticket to deck fixing – changing suits to Spades/Clubs to support Blackboard, or messing with ranks to benefit Odd Todd. This is a potential game-changer. It's the strongest play for long-term survival in Ante 5, giving me the potential to convert cards to Spades/Clubs and/or remove red cards.\n\nSo, Smeared Joker helps Flushes, but the loss of Stencil's value and the failure to support Blackboard makes it less appealing right now.\n\nIf I buy the Mega Arcana Pack for $8, I'll have $6 left. Blackboard is the core, and I need to prioritize Spades/Clubs. Joker Stencil's X2 is better than Smeared Joker. Mega Arcana seems like the play here.\n\nSo, I'm going for the Mega Arcana Pack.\n\nI'll execute the command `buy_booster` at position `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
