{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm starting at Ante 1 with $5. My current Joker is Odd Todd, which is a fantastic early-game chip engine given the common odd cards. The goal, as always, is to set up a robust chip and/or economy build, preferably finding a Mult joker. Let's break down the shop:\n\n*   **The Hierophant:** This Tarot card is tempting for upgrading cards to Bonus cards, but I can't *use* it right now since I don't have any cards in my hand. It looks like I could *buy* it and hold it, according to the command list, but given that it requires cards in my hand, it's not ideal right now.\n*   **Drunkard:** A discard refresh. Not a priority.\n*   **Celestial Pack:** Offers a random Planet card, which *could* be good, but it's not guaranteed.\n*   **Grabber Voucher:** Way out of my current price range.\n*   **Reroll:** Too expensive, wipes out all my money and the interest.\n\nI have $5. If I wait, I'll earn $1 interest when I hit the next round select. That's a 20% return. If I buy the Celestial Pack I'll be left with $1. If I buy The Hierophant, I'll be left with $2. Given I have Odd Todd, this round is a breeze: it's a solid chip joker and will easily handle the early blinds.\n\nSo, the optimal move is to save my money. I'm going to play `round_select`. This is the safest play, letting me accumulate interest and get to the next shop. I can clear the current Ante with Odd Todd.\n\nChecking the `round_select` command once more, it does what I expect and ends shopping. Leveling up early game is appealing, but the interest return is very attractive. In Ante 1, getting a Mult joker is high-priority, but I don't see that option here. The Celestial Pack is a trap.\n\nTherefore, the final play is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
