{"reasoning":"**Blackboard Strategy for Ante 2/8 (Boss: The Window)**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Round 6 with a goal of 1,600 chips, and that pesky \"Window\" boss is debuffing all my Diamond cards.  My Joker lineup is Odd Todd, a regular Joker, Blackboard (x3 Mult for Spades/Clubs), and Joker Stencil (x2 Mult with one empty slot).  My current hand is: 9 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 3 of Spades, Jack of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds (debuffed), and Jack of Diamonds (debuffed). I have 4 hands left and 4 discards. I have $8.\n\nBlackboard is key here, but it's only active if all the cards *held in my hand* are Spades or Clubs.  Currently, I've got Hearts and Diamonds cluttering things up.  Diamonds are useless except for hand evaluation, but they're still in my hand.\n\nI've calculated that I need to discard the Hearts (JH, 4H) and Diamonds (QD, JD) to draw for a possible Blackboard activation.  If I can get all Spades or Clubs in my hand after the draw, Blackboard will kick in, tripling my multiplier.\n\nLet's do some quick math. With the 9 of Spades as a High Card, without Blackboard, I can score: (15 + 9 + 31) * (2 + 4) * 2 = 660 chips. That's not enough to hit the 1600 goal.  With Blackboard, a High Card (9S) becomes: (15 + 9 + 31) * (2 + 4) * 3 * 2 = 1980 chips. Boom, that's enough!\n\nSo, the optimal play is clear: I need to discard the Jack of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds, and Jack of Diamonds – positions 5, 6, 7, and 8. Wait, I have an additional discard. Keep the Spades.\n\nMy final action will be to discard positions [5, 6, 7, 8]. This is the most efficient play to get the Blackboard bonus.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8]"}
