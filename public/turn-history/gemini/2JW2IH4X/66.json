{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's round 8, still in the shop phase. I've got a measly $2 – not ideal, but let's see what we can do. I've got the following Jokers in play: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I've also got the Telescope voucher.\n\nI've already optimized the Joker order, prioritizing additive multipliers like Swashbuckler before the multiplicative ones like Blackboard and Stencil. If I can hit a Flush (which is at Level 5, with 95 Chips and 12 Mult), the current math looks like this: (12 [Base] + 9 [Swashbuckler]) * 3 [Blackboard] * 2 [Stencil] = 21 * 3 * 2 = 126 Mult, which isn't bad! And then I can add an additional +31 chips for any odd cards I play.\n\nThe shop itself isn't offering much. Bootstraps is available, but at $7, it's completely out of reach. A reroll is also $5, so that's a no-go too. I could sell Odd Todd for $2, but that doesn’t help me.\n\nI can't buy anything, I can't reroll, and the joker order is already the best it can be. There are no consumables to use or sell. Looks like I'm out of options here. Time to move on and select the next Blind.\n\nAction: `round_select`\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
