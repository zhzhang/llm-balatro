{"reasoning":"**Strategic Pack Selection: Optimizing for Flush Synergy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're at Ante 3/8, Round 7, deep in a Celestial Pack during the PLANET_PACK step. We have $5, and the following Jokers: Odd Todd, two regular Jokers, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. Plus, we've got the Telescope voucher, which is key. The Telescope is giving us the Planet card, and since Flush is my most played hand (Level 3, played 4 times), Telescope has provided Jupiter, which is great. I need to maximize score potential, and Flush is the focus.\n\nLooking at the Planet cards: we have Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus. Jupiter boosts Flush by +2 Mult, and +15 chips, which is perfect. Mercury upgrades Pair, and Venus boosts Three of a Kind. Easy decision. Blackboard is already a strong support piece because it triples the mult of cards held if they are Spades/Clubs and if I'm going for Flushes, it is a perfect partner, specifically focusing on Spades and Clubs.\n\nTherefore, Jupiter is the clear winner, as it directly upgrades my primary scoring strategy. The `select` action is what I need. Position 1 is where Jupiter is located in the pack. No target cards are necessary as this is a pack selection, not a hand.\n\nSo, the action will be `select`, the positions [1] to select Jupiter, the intended hand type is null and the estimated chips null. Let's make sure the JSON is valid. Okay, it's valid. Checking the schema, \"action\" is the only required field. The rest are optional but should be there if appropriate.\n\nThe logic is solid. Jupiter is the best choice for this Flush build, supported by the Telescope. Let's make it happen.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
