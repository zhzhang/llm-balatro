{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment: Shop Phase - Limited Options**\n\nAlright, I'm in the shop again, fresh from using that Moon card to get some Clubs. Let's see... I've got $2. Looking at the Jokers, I've got a decent setup right now: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Stencil. That Swashbuckler is looking tasty, boosting based on the sell values.\n\nThe shop itself isn't offering anything appealing, though, everything is outside my price range. Splash, Justice, Arcana Pack, Crystal Ball, and even a reroll are all out. Selling any of my current Jokers would be a huge misstep; their synergies are working perfectly, and I've got a Level 14 Flush, Blackjack, and Stencil. I'm not going to throw that away for something I can't even afford.\n\nSo, it seems the best play is to just advance to the next round. It's the Big Blind of Ante 7, which will be the real test. We beat the small blind, but still, $2 isn't going to get me far. Inventory is pretty much full, so no space for new purchases or consumables. Time to move on and see what the cards hold!\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
