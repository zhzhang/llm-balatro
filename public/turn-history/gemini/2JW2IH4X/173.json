{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Mega Celestial Pack - Round 19**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 8, Round 19, in the Planet Pack (Mega Celestial, naturally). I've got a decent Joker setup: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. Currently, I have $14 in the bank. Last round I chose Jupiter, and my main strategy is built around Flushes, currently at Level 17. Now, I have four options left: Mercury, Neptune, Venus, and Pluto. My goal is to select the second planet.\n\nLet's break down the upgrades. Mercury levels up Pair, Venus levels up Three of a Kind, and Neptune levels up Straight Flush, and Pluto upgrades High Card. Neptune’s upgrade, Straight Flush Level 2 to 3, offers the most significant boost, with +4 Mult and +40 Chips, making it a standout. Pluto, on the other hand, is a High Card upgrade, from Level 3 to 4. While it's occasionally useful, even at level 4, it's weaker overall. And since my strategy already leverages Flushes, upgrading Straight Flush indirectly enhances that strategy, should I happen to draw into a Straight Flush.\n\nI've already confirmed I picked Jupiter in the previous turn, so it's not an option. The remaining choices are Mercury (1), Neptune (2), Venus (3), and Pluto (4). I double-checked that Neptune is indeed in position 2. I have no need to sell Jokers, and I don't own any consumables.\n\nI have decided to select Neptune, which is in position 2. This command will be to \"select 2\".\n\n*Wait, one last double-check…* Let's compare the potential payouts again: Flush Level 17 gives 275 Chips, 36 Mult. Straight Flush Level 2 nets 140 Chips and 12 Mult. Upgrading Straight Flush to Level 3 with Neptune now gives 180 Chips and 16 Mult. High Card at Level 3 nets 25 Chips and 3 Mult, but Level 4 (with Pluto) jumps to 35 Chips and 4 Mult. The Straight Flush upgrade is clearly superior.\n\nOkay, I'm confident. The optimal move is to take Neptune for the Straight Flush upgrade.\n\n*Final structure check…* My instructions indicate I should only output valid JSON. So I will ensure the JSON is correct, which should be: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
