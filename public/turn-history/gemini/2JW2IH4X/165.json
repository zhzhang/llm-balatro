{"reasoning":"**Final Ante, Final Push**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: Ante 8, final boss. Time to crunch. I've got $19, a Flush-focused build at level 16, and some key Jokers: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I'm leveraging Telescope for those sweet Celestial Packs and guaranteed Flushes.\n\nMy strategy? Keep the Flush high and let the Jokers do their thing. Blackboard needs Spades/Clubs, which is why Drunkard was initially interesting for the extra discard. But wait, Drunkard eats a Joker slot. And Joker Stencil? That's a *massive* multiplier right now. With 4 Jokers, it's at x2. If I add another Joker, it drops to x1. That's a huge mult loss. So, Drunkard is a no-go, and therefore so is The Family.\n\nLet's do some quick mental math on my current mult: (Base + Swashbuckler) * Blackboard * Stencil = (34 + 9) * 3 * 2 = 258. Buying Drunkard would be (34 + 9) * 3 * 1 = 129. Forget it.\n\nI'm thinking Celestial Packs. A reroll is probably better than a Standard Pack unless it gives me the cards I need to thin the deck. I need to find a pack.\n\nHmm, Hieroglyph is an option. It drops the Ante back to 7, giving me a few more rounds to scale. However, I’ve got to win at Ante 8. The extra scaling can be tempting, but I don't know the boss' score. If I can win here, why risk the extra rounds? It's better to stick with a direct power-up strategy. Let’s stay at Ante 8 and focus on Jupiter.\n\nI've got $19, and the goal is to get a Celestial Pack for the guaranteed Flush level up. Reroll the shop. I need to keep the power level high.\n\nBefore I commit, let's look at Swashbuckler. Buying Drunkard gives him +2 mult from the sell value, but Stencil's x2 mult is *way* more important.\n\nReroll shop.\n\nYep, rerolling the shop for that Jupiter is the play. Time to get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
