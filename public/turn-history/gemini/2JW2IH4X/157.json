{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop in Round 17**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop phase of Round 17, Ante 7/8. I've got $9 to work with. My current hand is heavily focused on a Flush, which is already at Level 15 and provides 245 chips with a 32x multiplier. The Telescope voucher gives me a Celestial Pack containing the most played hand, which is, of course, a Flush. I have these Jokers: Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd cards), Swashbuckler (+9 Mult from sell values), Blackboard (x3 Mult if all Spades/Clubs), and Joker Stencil (x2 Mult because one empty slot).\n\nConsidering the upcoming Boss Blind, I need to maximize my scoring potential. The Celestial Pack guarantees a Jupiter card to further level my Flush.  This is essential. It costs $4, which leaves me with $5 afterward. \n\nShould I buy anything else? A Misprint or basic Joker aren't tempting since they'd fill my Joker slot. Buying another Joker would drop the Stencil's x2 Multiplier to x1, and the Misprint (+0-20 mult) or Joker (+4 mult) aren't worth giving up the Stencil x2, especially with Blackboard's x3 and my high base Multiplier (32 from Flush + 9 from Swash + x3 from Blackboard is 123; doubling 123 is 246, which is far better than adding 4 or 20). The Jumbo Arcana Pack is out of the question since it costs $6 and I only have $5 left.\n\nTherefore, the obvious play is to buy the Celestial Pack.\n\nThe parsed action would look like this:\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n    \"positions\": [1],\n    \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
