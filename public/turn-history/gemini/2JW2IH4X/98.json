{"reasoning":"**The Calculated Gamble: Skipping the Blind for Celestial Advantage**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 5/8, Round 11, and the Small Blind is staring me down at $11,000. Big Blind is $16,500, and the Boss Ante is a hefty $44,000. My current goal? Reach that 8/8 Ante. I'm running a high-level Flush strategy – currently at Level 8, which is pretty solid (Base Chips 140, Base Mult 18). I have a Telescope Voucher, which is key. It guarantees that any Celestial Pack I open contains the card type for my most played hand – in this case, Flush.\n\nMy Jokers are Odd Todd (chip buff), Swashbuckler (mult based on other jokers), Blackboard (x3 mult for Spades/Clubs), and Joker Stencil (x2 mult for an empty slot). My current setup optimizes the order: Odd Todd for chips first, then Swashbuckler for additive mult, followed by Blackboard and Stencil for multiplicative boosts. My money is low, sitting at $6.\n\nNow, here's the big decision. I can play the round, which gives me $3 plus interest and potential hand rewards, along with shop access. Or, I can *skip* the round and get a Meteor Tag, which gives me a Mega Celestial Pack. The key here is the Telescope. That Meteor Tag essentially turns into a guaranteed Jupiter card (Flush level up). A Mega Celestial Pack gives me 2 cards to choose from 5.\n\nThe math screams \"skip.\" Leveling up my Flush, especially going to Level 9 or even 10, is huge, given that the telescope ensures at least one Jupiter card. It drastically increases my scoring ability, especially for the Boss Ante. My last Flush in Boss Ante 4 cleared 16,308 chips. The small blind of $11,000 is definitely beatable in one or two hands. But leveling up guarantees beating the boss too.\n\nA Mega Celestial Pack is worth about $8 in the shop. I’m giving up the $3 from the round plus interest, but the guaranteed pack, and therefore, guaranteed Flush boost, is a better trade.\n\nThe action is clear. I’m going to `skip_round`. I don’t need any further parameters – the Meteor Tag will be mine, and with it, hopefully, a Jupiter card and a quick route to 8/8.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
