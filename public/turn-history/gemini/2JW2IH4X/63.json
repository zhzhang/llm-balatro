{"reasoning":"**Strategic Flush Maximization: A Calculated Decision**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's the shop phase of round 8, and I've got $5 in the bank. My immediate goal, as always, is to maximize my score, specifically by leveraging my Flushes. I've got a Flush Level 5, which gives me a base of 95 chips and a 12x multiplier to work with.\n\nCurrently, my Joker lineup is: Odd Todd, which is good for the odd cards that make up this flush, then a regular +4 multiplier Joker, Blackboard (a x3 multiplier for Spades/Clubs), and a Joker Stencil (which is currently x2, due to an open slot). My recent action was to sell the Ceremonial Dagger.\n\nMy strategic blueprint from the previous turn was to ditch the basic +4 Multiplier Joker and scoop up Swashbuckler, which gives a multiplier based on the value of my other Jokers. Now, let's recalibrate.\n\nI start by considering the potential of selling the +4 Joker for $1, putting me at $6, and making the Joker Stencil X3. This would bring my multiplier to (12 base) * (3 Blackboard) * (3 Stencil) = 108.\n\nBut, and this is the crux, if I sell that Joker and then buy Swashbuckler for $4, that gives me $2 left. My Stencil goes back to X2. However, Swashbuckler's value is based on the sell value of my other Jokers (Odd Todd at $2, Blackboard $3, Stencil $4 which is 2+3+4 = 9 total mult). Thus, my updated multiplier becomes (12 base + 9 Swashbuckler) * (3 Blackboard) * (2 Stencil) = 126.\n\nComparing the two scenarios: Just selling the Joker gives me a multiplier of 108. Selling the Joker and buying Swashbuckler offers a multiplier of 126. Even accounting for Odd Todd's chip bonus, the multiplier comparison remains valid.\n\nRerolling is an option, but it costs $5, so it seems like I would be throwing away a chance for a better play in the Swashbuckler. Bootstraps costs $7, which I can't afford yet.\n\nSo, the optimal play, mathematically speaking, is still the \"sell Joker, buy Swashbuckler\" approach. It's a clear increase in my Flush scoring potential.\n\nThe action is clear: I'm going to `sell_joker 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
