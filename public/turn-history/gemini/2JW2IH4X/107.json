{"reasoning":"**The Immediate Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 6, Round 12, just finished a boss in Ante 5, and sitting on $15. My current Jokers are Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I'm rocking a Flush strategy, currently at Level 9 (155 chips, 20 Multiplier). Telescope is active, so I know my next Celestial Pack *will* have a Jupiter card.\n\nMy immediate goal is to level up that Flush, so Jupiter is a no-brainer. Level 10 gives me 170 chips and 22 Multiplier, which is a significant boost. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is a guaranteed upgrade thanks to the Telescope. I've got a good base going with my Jokers: Odd Todd adds chips, Swashbuckler is adding Multiplier based on the sell values of my Jokers, Blackboard gives x3 Multiplier to Spades and Clubs (which I have), and Stencil multiplies Multiplier by the number of empty slots. This gives me a rough Multiplier estimate of (Base + 9) * 3 * 2.\n\nNow, the shop: I'm not interested in Uranus since I'm all about Flushes, and Gluttonous Joker would fill a slot, making Stencil less effective. I'm really eyeing that Spectral Pack, though. They're high variance, but they can be absolutely game-changing. Ankh could duplicate a key Joker, Hex could add a polychrome, Aura would add a seal/edition, and Immolate is excellent for deck thinning. Ectoplasm is also a strong choice, adding Negative.\n\nI've got a plan. With my $15, I can afford *both* the Jumbo Celestial *and* the Spectral Pack. That will cost $10, leaving $5, which is exactly the interest breakpoint, in case I need it. The Jumbo Celestial is a guaranteed Jupiter, so that's the safe play. The Spectral Pack is where things get interesting. So I need to purchase these.\n\nThe prompt requires I take only one action, so: I should prioritize the Jumbo Celestial Pack and lock in the Flush upgrade. That's a 'buy_booster' action. Let's do that!\n\nAction: `buy_booster 1`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
