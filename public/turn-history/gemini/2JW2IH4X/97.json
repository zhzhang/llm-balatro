{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current Round and Shop**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5, Round 11. I've got $6, with the goal to maximize my score and beat the ante. My core strategy is a Level 8 Flush, boosted by Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. The Telescope voucher is key, guaranteeing a Celestial Pack with a Flush card.\n\nMy current jokers are Odd Todd (odd ranks), Swashbuckler (+Mult), Blackboard (X3 Spades/Clubs), and Joker Stencil (X2 for the empty joker slot). I've already used my consumables. I have 5 joker slots and can hold 2 consumables max.\n\nLooking at the shop, the *Smeared Joker* is a dud; it doesn't fit my Blackboard synergy. The *Uranus* upgrade for Two Pair is useless since I'm playing Flushes. A *Standard Pack* might give me a black card or an odd-rank card, but it's a gamble. The *Seed Money* voucher is out of reach, and a *Reroll* might yield a Celestial Pack, but leaves me with very little money.\n\nBuying anything now looks like a bad call. The interest I'd lose on my $6 is not worth it, especially considering I've already used my consumables. The shop doesn't offer any significant improvement to my current setup. Spending $4 for a Standard Pack and getting down to $2 (losing $1 interest) is not worth it. I'm better off moving to the next round to earn more money from the base reward, hands remaining, and interest.\n\nRegarding the joker order: It's Odd Todd (+Chips) first, then Swashbuckler (+Mult) since this adds to any existing multipliers, followed by Blackboard and Joker Stencil (both multiplicative, so order doesn't matter).\n\nTherefore, my best move is to proceed to the round selection.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
