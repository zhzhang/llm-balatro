{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Assessment: Round 13**\n\nOkay, so we're at the Shop phase of Ante 6/8, and I've got a single dollar to my name. Let's see what we're working with. My Joker lineup is solid, optimized for efficiency: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. It's a classic setup: chips, additive mult, then multiplicative mult, and there's no need to rearrange them.\n\nLooking at the Shop, Pluto and Lusty Joker are tempting, but both are out of my price range. Reroll Surplus is a non-starter at ten dollars. Even the reroll itself is a no-go since it's five bucks. I'm completely tapped out.\n\nGiven that I'm broke and the Jokers are well-ordered, there's only one logical action here: move on to round selection. There's nothing to buy, nothing to reroll, and my hand level is decent at Flush Level 12, so no need to sell anything. It's time to play, and hopefully, I can earn some cash in the next round. The game must go on.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
