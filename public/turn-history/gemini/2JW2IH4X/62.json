{"reasoning":"**Strategic Joker Acquisition and Optimization**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Round 8, the shop's open, and I'm sitting on $2. My inventory is looking decent, but I can definitely optimize it for maximum score. I've got: Odd Todd, a standard Joker, Blackboard, Joker Stencil, and Ceremonial Dagger. My goal is clear: maximize the score for the upcoming rounds, aiming for a Flush Level 5 hand, because the Blackboard will then provide that sweet X3 multiplier on Spades/Clubs.\n\nInitially, the plan was to sell the Dagger, then the +4 Joker, and buy Swashbuckler. Let's see if that holds up. Selling the Dagger first boosts my cash to $5. Now, the Joker Stencil, currently at X1 because all slots are full, bumps up to X2 with one slot freed up. A quick calculation shows that, with those changes, my base mult increases to 96 (from 48).\n\nThen, I was considering buying Swashbuckler. But, that gets messy. Buying Swashbuckler would bring down the Stencil Mult to X1, and Swashbuckler provides a +10 mult based on the sell values of the other Jokers. The total would be around 78, worse than just the Stencil.\n\nHowever, if I sell both the Dagger and the +4 Joker, I'd then have $6 and free up slots. The Stencil would then go to X3, and the base mult becomes 108. It's better than the initial plan, but still not the best.\n\nWhat if I sell both the Dagger and the +4 Joker, then *buy* Swashbuckler? The Stencil will go to X2, and Swashbuckler then adds +9 from the other Jokers. Now, the total is (12 + 9) * 2 * 3 = 126! Much better. The logic seems clear.\n\nSo, the play is: sell the Ceremonial Dagger (Position 5), then sell the standard +4 Joker (Position 2), and then buy Swashbuckler (Shop Position 2). This frees up space for a better stencil, adds to the multiplier, and leaves me with $2.\n\nLet's quickly confirm. Selling the Dagger first, my money goes to $5, and the Stencil goes from X1 to X2. Perfect. This means the action I need to take is `sell_joker` at position 5. My logic is sound, let's roll with this strategy.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
