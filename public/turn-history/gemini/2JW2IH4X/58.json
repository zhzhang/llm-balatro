{"reasoning":"**My Game Plan for Round 8**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante is at 3/8, in the shop phase, with $8. My inventory's looking decent: Odd Todd, that solid Joker for odd ranks; the plain Joker for some flat Mult; Blackboard, the x3 beast if I can commit to Spades/Clubs; and Joker Stencil, currently giving me a x2 Mult because I have an empty slot, but I'm wary of filling it. I have the Telescope voucher, so I know I'll get a Planet card if I play a Flush Level 5 hand, which is my usual strategy, but I'm thinking about Blackboard more and more.\n\nThe shop presents some interesting choices. Bootstraps is tempting, but a +2 Mult for $7 isn't great value right now. Swashbuckler, though, that one's got potential. It gives Mult equal to the sell value of my other Jokers. Right now, that's $10 total, so +10 Mult. However, that means losing the x2 on Joker Stencil. It is a tough decision:\n\nShould I grab the Arcana Pack first (the Tarot cards are always useful)? Or, I could use $4 to swap out my regular Joker for Swashbuckler. Let's think this through.\n\nMy current Mult calculation (Base + Joker) * Joker Stencil. Right now, that's (Base + 4) * 2. If I bought Swashbuckler, I would be at (Base + 4 + 10) * 1. Let's say my base Mult is 12. If I keep the empty slot with Joker Stencil, my mult is 32. If I fill the empty slot with Swashbuckler, my Mult is 26. So, Swashbuckler is a downgrade.\n\nHowever, if I sold the base Joker (+4 Mult, for $1) and *then* bought the Swashbuckler, I'd have a net cost of $3. My new Mult would be (Base + 9) * 2. If I sold the base Joker and purchased Swashbuckler, the mult would be 42! Okay, that's better. But, do I want to?\n\nLet's do the math again. The Arcana pack costs $4. Swashbuckler (net): -$3. The Arcana Pack is immediate utility, while Swashbuckler is permanent. Swashbuckler scales with Joker value and is definitely better in the long run. The Joker (+4 Mult) is the weakest link.\n\nFirst: The Arcana Pack might give me a Joker that helps, so that's the obvious action. Then, consider the Swashbuckler move.\n\nSo, if I buy the Arcana Pack, I'll have $4 left. I could then go for Swashbuckler. But, what if the Arcana Pack has something I need?\n\nOkay, let's buy the Arcana Pack. That's the most consistent move.\n\nAction: buy\\_booster, Position: 2\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
