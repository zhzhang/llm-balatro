{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Solidifying the Flush Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 6, round 14, and the goal is clear: maximize this Flush strategy and prepare for the upcoming Boss, \"The Head\". Hearts are debuffed, which is less relevant to my Clubs/Spades focus. I have $8. Let's see what we've got in this shop.\n\nMy current Jokers are solid: Odd Todd for those sweet odd-ranked card chips, Swashbuckler for the value, Blackboard for the multiplier on those Spades/Clubs, and Joker Stencil doubling the mult (because that empty slot is key!). A fifth joker? Tempting, but not if it nerfs the Stencil to X1. It's not worth it - I need to keep the Stencil multiplier at X2.\n\nLooking at the shop, the *Celestial Pack* is a must-have for $4. I have the Telescope, so Jupiter is guaranteed, and that's critical to level up the Flush. Flush is currently level 12 (200 Chips, 26 Mult), so improving it is always good. The *Arcana Pack* for $4 could give me more spades/clubs for Blackboard or even out the odds on my odd-numbered card build. The *Hanging Chad* for $4 is interesting. If I play an odd card first, it will trigger Odd Todd for an extra 62 chips. The *Misprint* joker is the big dud here, because it will nerf the Stencil multiplier, which will almost certainly outweigh the random benefit. I can already calculate that adding *Misprint* will hurt my overall mult.\n\nSo, the plan: prioritize the Celestial Pack. Then, I can decide if an Arcana pack is better or if I should save the remaining money. Given that I'm in Ante 6 and need to scale quickly, leveling up my main hand is the top priority. The best move is *buy\\_booster 2* (Celestial Pack). I'm confident in this decision.\n\nAction: *buy\\_booster 2*.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll go through it one more time. The shop cards are Misprint, Hanging Chad, Arcana Pack, and the Celestial Pack. Celestial Pack, again! Buying that is the move. I'll stick to *buy\\_booster 2*.\n\n*buy\\_booster 2*. It's all about that Flush!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
