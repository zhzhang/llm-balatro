{"reasoning":"**Current Decision: Buy the Jumbo Buffoon Pack**\n\nOkay, let's analyze this turn. We're in Round 8, at the SHOP step, with $8. My inventory is looking pretty good: Odd Todd for odd ranks, a basic +4 Mult Joker, Blackboard (Spades/Clubs bonus), and Joker Stencil (currently X2, potentially X1 if filled). I also have the Telescope voucher for potential Celestial Pack unlocks.\n\nThe goal remains beating the increasingly difficult blinds, and I'm still strategizing around Flushes (Level 5). I'm currently sitting at 32 Mult at least (base + 4) * 2.\n\nLooking at the shop, I have three options. Bootstraps isn't great at +2 Mult for $7 (so really just +2 Mult) with my current cash. Swashbuckler looks tempting (it gives Mult equal to sell value of other jokers), but adding it would force me to lose Joker Stencil's X2 multiplier. The sell value of my other Jokers is $10. With Swashbuckler I'd get +10 Mult, but lose the X2 multiplier, which is better unless the base is very low (less than 6). It seems like it isn't worth it.\n\nThat leaves the Jumbo Buffoon Pack at $6. This is the strong play here. It gives me four chances to find a significantly better Joker, potentially replacing the basic +4 Mult Joker. Even if it's not immediately a direct upgrade, it might unlock better synergies or offer future scaling, like Green Joker or Bus for example. So, despite having a plan, the Jumbo Buffoon Pack is the best bet to find a better joker, or at least a good joker that I can replace the +4 Mult one with.\n\nTherefore, I'm buying the Jumbo Buffoon Pack! That's `buy_booster 1`, where \"1\" refers to the first item in the shop. I should do that. The new plan, just to be precise is: buy the pack, *then* depending on what is in it, sell the old joker, if necessary. The money is there.\n\nOkay, let's buy the pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
