{"reasoning":"**A Calculated Hand: Flush for the Win**\n\nOkay, so the ante is 7/8, it's round 18, and the current blind is the Psychic. This means I *have* to play five cards, and I need a whopping 70,000 chips to clear this. I've got a little money to work with, but my hand is what matters. Currently I have 4 hands and 3 discards left.\n\nLet's break down the situation. I have some key Jokers: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. Odd Todd gives me bonus chips for odd-ranked cards, Swashbuckler is a multiplier, Blackboard is a huge X3 multiplier if *all* cards in my hand after the play are Spades or Clubs, and Joker Stencil is another multiplier. The 10 of Spades is a Steel card, giving a 1.5x multiplier while in hand.\n\nMy current hand is: 10 of Spades, two 8 of Spades, 7 of Spades (odd), 5 of Spades (odd), 3 of Spades (odd), King of Clubs, and 9 of Clubs (odd). Okay, that's interesting. I have a lot of Spades *and* Clubs here. A flush is level 16 with some solid base mult.\n\nNow, I'm thinking I can play a Flush. That means I need five cards of the same suit. I've got six Spades in my hand. Perfect! The Psychic blind requires five cards. I've got three odd cards among those Spades: 7, 5, and 3. I've got all the pieces I need! I have a flush available. If I play [8 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 3 of Spades] - I'm keeping the 10 of Spades, the King of Clubs, and the 9 of Clubs.\n\nThat's when Blackboard clicks. All three cards I hold after the play (10S, KC, 9C) are either Spades or Clubs. Blackboard will give me the crucial x3 multiplier. Odd Todd gives me a bonus for the odd ranked cards played, 7, 5, 3. The 10 of Spades will be worth 1.5x Multiplier as a steel card if it remains in my hand, which it will.\n\nLet's verify:\n\n*   Base Chips: 260.\n*   Played Cards Chips: (8 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 3) = 31.\n*   Odd Todd (7, 5, 3): 31 * 3 = 93.\n*   Total Chips: 260 + 31 + 93 = 384.\n*   Base Mult: 34.\n*   Swashbuckler: +9. Total mult = 43.\n*   Blackboard: x3\n*   Joker Stencil: x2\n*   Steel: x1.5\n*   Final Mult: 43 * 3 * 2 * 1.5 = 387\n*   Total Score: 384 \\* 387 = 148,608.\n\nThat *easily* clears the 70,000 chip requirement. I should also note I verified that the steel card is being held, that Odd Todd does count these cards, and my flush is a good play.\n\nLet's double-check. I'm playing the 8S, 8S, 7S, 5S, 3S which are at indices 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Yes. I'm playing a flush. I need to re-confirm that this will trigger Blackboard.\n\nPlaying 2,3,4,5,6 means I keep 10S, KC, and 9C in my hand. Perfect, they are all Spades or Clubs. Odd Todd is adding to my total.\n\nLet's re-calculate. The total is:\n\n*   Base Chips (Flush): 260\n*   Chips from Played Cards: 31\n*   Odd Todd: 93\n*   Total Chips: 384\n*   Base Mult: 34\n*   Swashbuckler: 9\n*   Independent Jokers: x3 (Blackboard), x2 (Stencil)\n*   Held Card Mult (Steel 10S): x1.5\n*   Total Mult: 43 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1.\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
