{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 15, Ante 7/8. We're in the PLANET_PACK phase. My inventory has Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil – pretty standard for this build. I've got $4 left. The key here is the Booster Pack choices: Jupiter (Flush), Saturn (Straight), and Venus (Three of a Kind).\n\nMy Flush is already at Level 13, with 215 base chips and a 28x multiplier. That's the core of my current strategy. I was able to guarantee the Jupiter card through the Telescope Voucher. I'm focusing on that Flush because it's the hand I'm playing the most. Saturn and Venus aren't relevant right now because I am focused on building the flush hand.\n\nLet's break down the choices:\n\n*   **Jupiter:** Levels up my Flush by +2 Mult and +15 Chips. This is ideal, directly impacting my core strategy. This is the choice.\n*   **Saturn:** Improves my Straight hand by +3 Mult and +30 Chips. This is not the focus of this play.\n*   **Venus:** Improves Three of a Kind by +2 Mult and +20 Chips. This isn't part of my plan.\n\nThe obvious play is Jupiter. Increasing my Flush's base stats is the priority. I'm going to select the first card in the list.\n\nThe action is a \"select\" and the position selected is \\[1]. The intended hand type, as a reminder to myself, is flush.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
