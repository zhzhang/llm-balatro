{"reasoning":"**Current Play Decision: Round 18 - All In on a Flush**\n\nOkay, final ante, and it's Round 18. The stakes are high: Small Blind at 50,000, Big Blind at 75,000, and a Boss Blind looming at 100,000 that forces me to select a card. I've got $14, aiming for 50,000 chips. My strategy? A high-scoring flush, which is already at Level 16 (260 chips, 34x multiplier). My Jokers are perfectly aligned for this: Odd Todd for extra chip generation on odd cards, Swashbuckler for a solid multiplier boost based on the other jokers' sell value (currently +9), Blackboard for a massive x3 multiplier if I can nail a flush in Spades/Clubs, and Joker Stencil for a further x2 multiplier since there's one open slot.\n\nLet's break down the potential. I'm projecting a flush score of around 92,880, easily surpassing the 50,000 target. I need to make sure to build the flush, which is something I am good at. I think the boss fight's \"forces a card\" mechanic isn't too scary, because I should be able to work around it and build a flush with enough cards, or strategically discard.\n\nI've got a Boss Tag that lets me reroll, but the real question is: is it worth skipping this round? I'm inclined to say no. Playing the round gives me more money - $3 reward plus $2 interest on my current funds, plus extra from hands remaining - and critically, it lets me hit the shop. I have Telescope, which *guarantees* Jupiter cards in Celestial Packs. I need more cash to buy these Jupiter cards for the upcoming blinds! Plus, with my current estimate of 90,000+ points on a flush, even the upcoming blinds are no sweat.\n\nGiven the money advantage, and my need for those Jupiter cards, playing `play_round` is the clear choice. Skipping with `skip_round` misses out on those crucial shop visits and potential cash.\n\nThe Joker order is already optimized: Odd Todd (chips), Swashbuckler (+Multi), Blackboard (xMulti), Joker Stencil (xMulti). Additive multipliers before multiplicative multipliers is always the way to go.\n\nSo, the action is `play_round`. Time to go for the flush!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
