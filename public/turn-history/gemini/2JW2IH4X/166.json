{"reasoning":"**The Ante 8 Decision**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 8, Shop phase. Got $14, some decent Jokers: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil, plus Telescope. Hand is leveled up to a Flush, level 16. The shop offers a Joker, Mercury, a Standard Pack, and Hieroglyph. Reroll is expensive at $6.\n\nOdd Todd is great for chip generation with all those odd cards I have. Swashbuckler boosts my multiplier based on other Joker sell values, and Blackboard gives a big multiplier boost for Spades/Clubs. Joker Stencil gives a x2 multiplier right now, which is super strong. I have the Telescope, meaning I can try to get Jupiter from Celestial Packs.\n\nThe Joker in the shop? Not worth it; it would actually *hurt* my output because it would make Stencil useless. Mercury doesn't align with my strategy, Standard Pack is random, and Hieroglyph is tempting to drop the difficulty, but no. I'm already in a good position.\n\nRerolling for a Celestial Pack, even though I have the Telescope, is risky with my current money and the high cost. I'm already crushing rounds, so I don't really need anything from the shop right now.\n\nMy scoring is high enough that I'm confident I can win. Let's see... my Flush gives me a good multiplier, and Odd Todd gets me more chips. I estimate I'm easily hitting over 100,000 per hand. I definitely need to scale further, but not in this shop.\n\nLet's look at the options. I *could* reroll and get Celestial, but it's expensive. Standard Pack is random. Hieroglyph, dropping to Ante 7, seems like a trap if I'm already strong and just delays the win. I'm thinking I'd be better off saving money for interest and future shops.\n\nIf I go to the next round, I'll have $16 plus round reward. Better than spending money here.\n\nWait, should I buy a Standard Pack just to see if it gives me a better card? No. Saving for interest and packs is better.\n\nI'm starting to think. I just rerolled, now the cost is more expensive. I should stop rerolling and save for the next shop where I'll have more money.\n\nBuy Joker? No. Standard Pack? Maybe, but saving interest is better. Reroll? Too expensive. I'm going to round select.\n\nOne last thing: the Joker setup. Odd Todd (Chips), Swashbuckler (+Mult), Blackboard (xMult), Joker Stencil (xMult) is already the optimal order.\n\nWhat about Hieroglyph again? It's tempting, but it'll cost me a hand each round, which is significant if I'm trying to win. It's better to save for the next shop.\n\nLet's check if the standard pack is worth it. No. I'll stick with round_select.\n\nWait, there is a Joker for $2. It'll make Swashbuckler have +10 mult, but Joker Stencil goes to x1. That's a bad trade.\n\nFinal decision: round_select.\n\nWait, is the Jumbo Arcana in the next shop? No, I'm already in the Shop!\n\nOkay, round_select.\n\nOh, I could go back to Ante 7 with Hieroglyph! But with the Jokers I have, I have a very high chance of beating Ante 8. I'll save the money.\n\nStandard Pack is better? It has a Blue or Purple seal. Maybe!\n\nWait, I should check if I can reroll the boss, I can't.\n\nOkay, let me double-check the math for the win.\n\nAnte 8 Big Blind, Small Blind, Boss? Yes. Okay. It looks like I am safe for now.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
