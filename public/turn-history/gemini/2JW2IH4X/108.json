{"reasoning":"**Analyzing My Next Move in the PLANET_PACK Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. I'm deep in the PLANET_PACK phase of this Jumbo Celestial Pack run, aiming to crush Ante 6 and beyond. My core strategy is a Flush build, currently at level 9, and I'm leveraging some solid Jokers: Odd Todd for the chip boost on odd rounds, Swashbuckler for multi based on sell value, Blackboard to 3x multi for Spades/Clubs, and Joker Stencil for the multi boost per empty slot. The Telescope Voucher is crucial, keeping Jupiter in the Celestial Packs. I have $9 to spend, the Spectral pack seems tempting, but I can improve my flush with the Jupiter card.\n\nLet's look at the best option:\n\n1.  **Jupiter (Flush Level 9 -> 10):** This is the key. Leveling up the Flush gives me +2 Multi and +15 Chips, which will directly impact my score with my existing hand.\n\n*   Neptune (Level 2 -> 3 Straight Flush): +4 Mult, +40 Chips - Interesting, but Straight Flushes are too rare to optimize for.\n*   Pluto (Level 3 -> 4 High Card): +1 Mult, +10 Chips - Not part of my build.\n*   Earth (Level 1 -> 2 Full House): +2 Mult, +25 Chips - Not part of my build.\n*   Saturn (Level 1 -> 2 Straight): +3 Mult, +30 Chips - Not part of my build.\n\nSince I am focused on a Flush build, Jupiter gives me the biggest return for consistency. I have consistently played Flushes, I am optimized for Flushes due to the deck and my jokers, and the Telescope ensures Jupiter is available. I'll need to select Jupiter to level up my Flush, so:\n\nI'm making a select action to select position `1`, intending to purchase the Jupiter card.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
