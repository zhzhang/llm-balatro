{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 2, and the Ante is 1. I've got $7 to play with, and I just snagged Blackboard for the Spade/Club multiplier. I'm thinking about maximizing hand level scaling, especially Flush, to synergize with Blackboard's multiplier. Odd Todd is decent for chip boost.\n\nLooking at the Shop, I can't afford the Ancient Joker or the Grabber Voucher, which is expected this early. The Celestial Packs are tempting, but I can only choose one. I have $7. I just bought Blackboard and now have $7.\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6) looks much more promising than the regular one ($4), given the higher chance of getting Jupiter, which would be ideal for a Flush build. I'm leaning heavily towards that path given my current items. I could buy the Jumbo pack and be left with $1. Considering that interest is only $1 per $5, and not worth worrying about at all. Leveling up those hands early seems far more important.\n\nThe action here is clear: buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack. Specifically, the command is `buy_booster 2`. My objective, as always, is to win the run, and I think that's the best approach to ensure that is to increase my hand level.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
