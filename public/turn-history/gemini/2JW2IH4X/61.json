{"reasoning":"**Current Tactical Analysis: Joker Selection - Buffoon Pack, Round 8**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 3/8, round 8. I'm staring at these Buffoon Pack Jokers with $2 in my pocket and a strategy built around Flushes, Blackboard (X3 Spades/Clubs), and the Joker Stencil (X2). My initial instinct is to maximize the value from that Stencil.\n\n*   **Madness** is out of the question; it's too volatile and jeopardizes the cornerstone Jokers like Blackboard and Stencil.\n*   **Splash** isn't immediately impactful for my Flush-centric approach. It becomes useful for non-Flush hands.\n*   **Gluttonous Joker** is interesting (+3 Mult per Club). It's synergistic, especially if I'm targeting a specific hand and could improve in certain situations. But, if it's not a club flush, it's not helping.\n*   **Ceremonial Dagger** is tempting as a long-term play, but requires fodder Jokers and is expensive to build, given my limited funds.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are, if I select Gluttonous Joker, I am replacing the flat +4 Mult. It reduces my Stencil down to X1, and I need to keep the X2 multiplier. A Club Flush would benefit greatly from Gluttonous, but not the other types.\n\nI'm thinking, Gluttonous Joker is the best \"immediate\" value. Sell the basic Joker (+4) and add Gluttonous Joker. I don't have to sell anything until after the pack, anyway.\n\nThen, wait… there's a better path here. I can get some immediate value. *Ceremonial Dagger* can be sold for $2. Taking it allows me to sell it, then I can buy a better Joker in the shop. With $4 I can buy the Swashbuckler. Let's do the math on the Swashbuckler:\n\n1.  Take Dagger (5 Jokers, X1 Stencil)\n2.  Sell Dagger ($2) (4 Jokers, X2 Stencil)\n3.  Sell the basic Joker ($1, +4 Mult) (3 Jokers, X3 Stencil)\n4.  Buy Swashbuckler ($4) (4 Jokers, X2 Stencil).\n\nIf I do all of this, I end up with Odd Todd, Blackboard, Stencil, and Swashbuckler (+9 Mult) * X2 * X3 = (12+9)\\*6 = 126 Mult! A significant upgrade from my current 96 Mult.\n\nSo, the optimal play here is to take the Dagger, sell it, then get Swashbuckler! I’m going to go with **`select 4`** and hopefully execute this plan.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
