{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Joker Market**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm at Ante 7, money's tight, but I've got a Flush deck cooking and some interesting Jokers to work with.  The Credit Card really opens up the shop for me, but the most important thing is maximizing my score potential *this* round. The shop is tempting. I need to make some key decisions. My starting chips are 275 for this flush, and the Flush is at level 17.\n\nRight now, I'm sitting on a decent hand. My current lineup, Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, Joker Stencil, and Credit Card gives me a decent amount of Mult, but I can definitely optimize. I'm looking at Constellation in the shop which grants x0.1 mult per Jupiter used, and I have Telescope.\n\nHere's the problem:  Joker Stencil is currently nerfed to X1 because I'm at the Joker limit. The Credit Card allows me to get out of the joker limit, but the money is not a big factor. The money is secondary to the Joker lineup.\n\nMy immediate scoring potential is:\n4 jokers: (275 + Odd Todd) * Swash * Blackboard * Stencil = 92k\n5 jokers: (275 + Odd Todd) * Swash * Blackboard * 1\n\nBut it's not simply about *this* round. Constellation has serious scaling potential. Swashbuckler is only providing flat mult, and Odd Todd is only giving me more base chips. Constellation, with the Telescope, can give me the jupiter planet. I need to keep the Credit Card to be able to buy things, so I need to make some hard choices about Jokers.\n\nMy plan crystallizes: I sell Swashbuckler, buy Constellation, sell Credit Card.\n\nThis plan will allow me to take advantage of Stencil to get the most multi out of my joker lineup.\n\n*   Sell Swashbuckler.\n*   Buy Constellation.\n*   Sell Credit Card.\n\nThis gets me the most scoring potential.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
