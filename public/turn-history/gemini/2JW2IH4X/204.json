{"reasoning":"**Final Ante Decision: Justice for the Win**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Big Blind, 75,000 chips needed, and I'm at the final ante. Let's make sure to hit the goal here. My hand is looking interesting. I need to hit a winning hand or set something up, and this seems like it is a good opportunity to set something up for a big win!\n\nI have the Justice consumable. My immediate thought is to use it for maximum impact. I have the Blackboard Joker, which gives a nice multiplier if I can keep all the cards in my hand as Spades or Clubs after playing a hand. I'm sitting on a potential Flush right now, all cards are Spades or Clubs (Ace of Hearts is Wild and matches those suits for the Joker), so Blackboard is active. I can use the odd number rank Joker for more chips per odd card. I want to build a hand with odd cards in it to make the most of that.\n\nMy Flush right now could use the cards 8 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 5 of Spades, and the Ace of Hearts (Wild). I can also do it with Clubs but the Spades hand seems easier to set up.\n\nIf I play that Flush, my immediate calculation is that I can get around 81,000 chips based on the base value, the rank chips, and the current Jokers: Blackboard, Stencil, Constellation. However, with Justice, I can make the Ace of Hearts a Glass Card. That doubles the value of that card in the Flush. That's a huge multiplier, I should definitely do that.\n\nNow, should I use Justice? It gives a massive multiplier to my Flush. I'm targeting a score of 75,000 and the last Flush was at about 88,000 without Justice. Using Justice means it's a one-shot win, and I don't have to risk. I will one shot the big blind by using Justice to guarantee the win, since it doubles the hand. If it breaks, I still win. The Boss is next anyway.\n\nI can just play the hand as-is and win, but using Justice secures the win. It makes it nearly double.\n\nNow, let's think about the JSON. It has to be perfect. The JSON is straightforward: I have to \"use\\_consumable,\" and I want to apply it to the Ace of Hearts. The JSON to \"use\\_consumable\" on the Ace of Hearts is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\":\"use_consumable\",\"positions\":[1,7],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}\n```\n\nOkay, the order: \"use\\_consumable\", then the positions. Position 1 has the Justice, and Position 7 has the Ace.\n\nI've got the hand in good shape, the math checks out, the JSON is ready, and it is going to be a fun hand. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,7]"}
