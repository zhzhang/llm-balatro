{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Play: A Flush for the Win**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Small Blind, Ante 4/8, Round 10. We need 5,000 chips. I have zero chips right now and 4 hands remaining with 2 discards available. I have $12.\n\nI've got the following Jokers in play: Odd Todd (+31 for odd ranks, which doesn't apply here), Swashbuckler (+9 mult based on the other Jokers' sell values), Blackboard (x3 mult if all cards in hand are Spades or Clubs), and Joker Stencil (x2 mult due to the empty slot). The Joker Stencil is giving me x2 mult.\n\nMy hand: A Flush of Clubs (4, 6, Jack, Queen, and King). Level 5 Flush with 95 Base Chips and 12 Mult.\n\nThe initial gut reaction is to play the flush. The calculation is pretty straightforward. Flush base is 95 chips, the card chips add up to 40 (10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 4), for a total of 135 chips. Base mult is 12, then Swashbuckler gives +9, total 21. Joker Stencil multiplies by 2, bringing us to a total mult of 42. So, total chips: 135 * 42 = 5,670.\n\nThat's well over the 5,000 chip target. Bingo.\n\nThe Boss Blind is \"Play only 1 hand type this round.\" I've already been playing Flushes. One hand is efficient. Playing this hand locks it in. I also get a hand $ bonus for future hands.\n\nEven if I wanted to go for Blackboard (x3 Mult), I have a very low probability of drawing all Spades/Clubs and still being a Flush. It’s risky, but not required to meet the win condition. It’s better to guarantee a win.\n\nBefore I commit, I double-check. Odd Todd is irrelevant; none of these cards are odd (A, 9, 7, 5, 3). Swashbuckler is also correct: $2 (Todd) + $3 (Blackboard) + $4 (Stencil) = 9 mult. Joker Stencil's x2 mult is confirmed.\n\nAlright, the numbers are rock solid. 135 chips * 42 mult = 5,670 chips. 5,670 > 5,000. It's a clear win. It's safe. No planet cards or debuffs.\n\nAction: Play a Flush of Clubs: 4, 6, Jack, Queen, and King.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,7]"}
