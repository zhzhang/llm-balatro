{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase after finishing Ante 1 (actually Ante 2, Round 3, confusing as that is), and I've got $5 to work with. The next round is Small Blind Ante 2. The goal is to maximize my score and keep building toward victory, but I'm severely cash-strapped right now.\n\nLooking at my current setup: I'm running with a strong Flush strategy, Level 2 (50 Chips, 6 Mult). I've got three Jokers: Odd Todd, Blackboard, and a plain Joker. The hand's potential right now is around 5400 points, easily exceeding the Ante 2 thresholds.\n\nThe shop offerings are: Gift Card ($6 - nope!), Venus ($3, levels up Three of a Kind), a Jumbo Standard Pack ($6 - also nope!), Overstock ($10 - haha), and a Reroll ($5). I can’t afford the Gift Card or Pack. Buying Venus levels up Three of a Kind, but I'm focusing on Flushes. Venus is alright but not a game-changer for my current build. A reroll would leave me broke, which is a terrible idea since I'd miss interest and be unable to buy anything in the new shop.\n\nBuying Venus is the only affordable thing, but it will leave me with $2. Spending $3 means I lose out on the $1 interest I'd get for keeping $5. The interest is more valuable, even though it doesn't seem like much.\n\nA quick calculation: a strong Flush gives 5400 points easily. I don't need Venus right now.\n\nSince I only have $5, my best move is to keep my money and move on to the next round. Rerolling is out of the question as I'd have nothing left and miss interest.\n\nThe best play is simple: I'll advance to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
