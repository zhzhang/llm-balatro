{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy for Ante 4/8, Round 10**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My immediate goal is 5,000 chips. I'm sitting on $20 and currently in the Shop.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the Jokers. I've got a solid crew: Odd Todd (+31 for odd ranks), Swashbuckler (+Mult based on the sell value of other Jokers, currently +9), Blackboard (x3 Mult on Spades/Clubs hands), and Joker Stencil (x1 Mult per empty slot, currently x2). Hand Level is Flush 5 (95 chips, 12 Mult), which is my main play.\n\nI see a Jupiter card for $3. That's a must-buy. It'll level up my Flush. I'm already eyeing a Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6, and with the Telescope voucher, I *know* it will have another Jupiter. Buying the individual Jupiter plus the pack is the optimal play: two Jupiter upgrades for $9.\n\nNow, that Blue Joker is tempting. +104 chips, and it's only $5. But this requires some heavy math. If I add it, Joker Stencil drops to x1.\n\nLet's do the math on the current multipliers, which is approximately: (12 base + 9 Swashbuckler) * 2 Stencil * 3 Blackboard = 126.\n\nIf I add the Blue Joker: (12 + 11 Swashbuckler) * 1 Stencil * 3 Blackboard = 63. No, wait, if I sell Todd, Swashbuckler goes to 11. It *still* equals 63.\n\nCurrently, 95 chips, with 126 Mult is 17010 points. If I buy the blue joker, that drops to 63 Mult * 239 Chips, which is about 15057.\n\nSo, adding Blue Joker:\n* Pros: +104 chips, +2 Swashbuckler mult.\n* Cons: Stencil drops from x2 to x1.\nThe net result is worse. It reduces my score because it kills that Stencil multiplier. I should keep the empty slot.\n\nA Jumbo Arcana Pack for $6 is always a good option – Tarot cards are incredibly useful. Steel cards for Blackboard, Hermit for cash, all very good.\n\nThe Seed Money voucher is interesting. Interest can get me up to $10. I'm currently at $20. But, if I buy Jupiter ($3) and the Celestial Pack ($6), I'm down to $11. Buying Seed Money then leaves me at $1, which is terrible for interest. My current interest cap is $5. No, not this round.\n\n**So, the plan:**\n1.  Buy and use Jupiter ($3).\n2.  Buy and use Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6). I know this will have another Jupiter.\n3.  Then, I'll *consider* the Jumbo Arcana Pack.\n4.  I will be left with $11. I should focus on maximizing interest. So, no further spending. I will get $2 of interest.\n\nLet me make sure. Flush is level 5. Two Jupiters gets me to level 7.\nStarting Money: $20.\n$20 - $3 (Jupiter) = $17.\n$17 - $6 (Celestial Pack) = $11.\n\nI should also note that adding Blue Joker *and* selling Odd Todd doesn't make sense. Todd gives me +31 per odd card. Blue Joker gives +104 flat. If I play 5 cards in a flush, and 3 are odd, Todd gives 93. Blue Joker gives 104. Blue Joker is slightly better than Todd, but Todd is already in hand and sells for $2. Blue Joker costs $5. Not worth the swap right now.\n\n**Action: Buy and use Jupiter.**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
