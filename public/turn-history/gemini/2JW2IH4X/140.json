{"reasoning":"**Celestial Pack Over All Else**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 7, Round 15. I've got $8. My primary goal here is to maximize my score potential *right now* for these upcoming blinds. Flush is my bread and butter – it's at Level 13. My hand composition is great: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I’m thinking hard about the best move here.\n\nI’m looking at the shop. Juggler is tempting (+1 hand size), but it costs $4 and it will kill the Joker Stencil multiplier bonus. Uranus is a solid card, but I'm not playing Two Pair. The other cards are a standard and celestial pack.\n\nI've got a major advantage: the Telescope Voucher. It *guarantees* that the Celestial Pack will give me Jupiter, the Planet card for Flushes, because that's my most played hand. I can use this to level up my Flush, which is critical.\n\nCurrent thoughts:\n\n*   Buy Celestial Pack ($4): Jupiter will power up my Flush. This is a no-brainer with the Telescope guarantee.\n*   The Standard Pack is nice, but it's an RNG gamble.\n*   Juggler is out. It’s $4 and would trash the Stencil multiplier, which will cost me a ton of points.\n\nLet's do the math again just to be sure... Current multiplier is 222: (28 + 9) * 3 * 2 = 222.\nWith Juggler: (28 + 9) * 3 * 1 = 111.\nNo way. Juggler makes me lose score.\n\nJupiter (Flush Planet) would get me to: (30 + 9) * 3 * 2 = 234. That's a solid upgrade!\n\nThe obvious move is the Celestial Pack. It's a guaranteed power-up.\n\nSo, the action is: `buy_booster 2`. That's that. No need to overthink it. Flush strategy is the winning strategy. And with Telescope, it's the surest play.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
