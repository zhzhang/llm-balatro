{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop phase of this run, and the goal is to maximize my score for the upcoming Boss Blind. I've got $9 to work with, and a few Jokers in play: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. The key play here is to level up my Flush hand; it's already at level 14 thanks to the Jupiter consumable I have in my inventory (gained from the Ace of Clubs).\n\nFirst, I need to make the most of what's available. The Telescope voucher in this run *guarantees* that the Celestial Pack will contain another Jupiter, which is crucial for maximizing my Flush hand. I can afford it at $4.\n\nGiven the Joker Stencil's x2 multiplier currently because I have one open slot, buying any other joker in the shop is a bad move, even though I have $5 to spare. The other shop Jokers, Misprint and Joker, won't provide a greater than x2 multiplier to justify losing the x2 mult.\n\nSo, the optimal sequence is clear:\n\n1.  **Use the Jupiter** I currently have. This will level up my Flush.\n2.  **Buy the Celestial Pack**. I'll then immediately be able to use the Jupiter I get from it, because I have 2 consumable slots.\n3.  Evaluate the options for next round.\n\nTherefore, the first action is to use the Jupiter at position 1. The estimated chips will be around 90,000 based on the last score.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
