{"reasoning":"**Flush Setup: Discard Strategy**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 20, up against the Cerulean Bell boss, which forces one card to always be selected. We need 70,000 chips, and we're starting at zero. We have 3 hands remaining, 4 discards, and we're currently in the hole at -$6. This feels solvable. I have a gut feeling.\n\nMy Jokers are decent: Odd Todd for odd ranks, Blackboard for all-Spades/Clubs hands, Stencil, and Constellation. Consumable: Justice (Glass card). Vouchers: Telescope, Hieroglyph.\n\nLooking at the hand, the primary scorer here is a Flush, which is at level 17 with 275 base chips. Blackboard is key to multiplying the score with its x3 multiplier - but only *if* all cards *held* in the hand are Spades or Clubs. I have an Odd Todd and a Stencil, too, but I need to focus on the big payoff.\n\nNow, looking at the cards. The Jack of Clubs is forced, position 5. My current hand has the following:\n*   9 of Spades (Spade, Odd)\n*   Queen of Hearts (Heart)\n*   9 of Hearts (Heart, Odd)\n*   2 of Hearts (Heart)\n*   Jack of Clubs (Club, Forced)\n*   6 of Clubs (Club)\n*   2 of Clubs (Club)\n*   4 of Diamonds (Diamond)\n\nCards 2, 3, 4, and 8 are non-Spades/Clubs and those need to go. If I discard these, I can fish for more Spades or Clubs. I *have* to include the forced card (position 5) in any discard action. I need to discard the forced card (JC).\n\nDiscarding the red cards along with the forced card seems like the right move, aiming for that Blackboard boost on the next hand. If I hold the JC, I limit my discards to 4. I can't *unselect* the JC. That's the boss's rule.\n\nLet's discard the Queen of Hearts, the 9 of Hearts, the 2 of Hearts, the Jack of Clubs (forced), and the 4 of Diamonds. That's positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.\n\nThe deck has a high proportion of Spades and Clubs (35 out of 47). I'm removing the red cards to increase the probability of a hand of all Black cards for Blackboard.\n\nSo, the action is \"discard\", the positions are [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]. I need to craft the JSON: `{\"action\": \"discard\", \"positions\": [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]}`. That covers all the bases.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,8]"}
