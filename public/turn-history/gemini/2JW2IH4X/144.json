{"reasoning":"**Current State and Strategic Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. It's Round 15, Ante 7, and I'm in the shop phase. The situation is pretty tight – I'm flat broke with zero dollars. Looking at my inventory, I have a solid set of Jokers: Odd Todd (chips for odd ranks), Swashbuckler (mult based on sell value), Blackboard (X3 mult if all cards are Spades or Clubs), and Joker Stencil (X2 mult for each empty slot). My hand strength is a Level 14 Flush, which is good, but I need to maximize this round.\n\nThe shop offers no immediate value. Juggler and Uranus cards are available, but I can't afford them. I can't buy any boosters or the Crystal Ball voucher either. Rerolls are out of the question as well, due to my lack of funds. I also don't have any consumables.\n\nI've already assessed the Joker lineup. The current order is mathematically optimal: Odd Todd (chip boost), Swashbuckler (additive mult), Blackboard and Joker Stencil (multiplicative mult) based on current strategy. I don't need to sell any jokers either. The focus now is on what to do next.\n\nConsidering the previous turn analysis, I anticipate an estimated 98,280 chips for a Level 14 Flush, which may not be enough to reach the target, ~110,000 to 140,000 chips. I will need to be very lucky with draws.\n\nSo, the optimal play here is to advance to the next round with a flush, and go from there. Here's the finalized output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 98280\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
