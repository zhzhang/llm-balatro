{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 3/8, round 8, in the BLIND_SELECT phase, staring down The Hook boss with its -1 hand size debuff. I need to hit 4000 chips to clear this, and I've only got $2 to my name. Fortunately, I'm loaded with Jokers, and my hand levels are looking pretty strong with a flush at Level 5. My current inventory is: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I've also got the Telescope voucher, though that's not helping me now.\n\nLooking back, I've been riding flush-based strategies lately, racking up around 6000 chips per hand. The goal, clearly, is to defeat this boss.\n\nI'm in the BLIND_SELECT phase. My immediate options are to `play_round`, `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, or `sell_joker`. No consumables to use or sell, and my Jokers are already in the optimal order for a flush: Odd Todd is adding chips, Swashbuckler adds mult, Blackboard is a 3x multiplier if I stick with Spades/Clubs and Joker Stencil is a 2x mult as well. Playing a flush makes the most sense.\n\nWith my current Joker setup and a Flush Level 5, here's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Chips:** 95 from the flush, plus whatever Odd Todd provides.\n*   **Multiplier:** (12 from the flush + 9 from Swashbuckler) * 3 from Blackboard * 2 from Stencil = 126.\n*   **Total Score:** Roughly 95 * 126 = 11,970 chips.\n\nThat's well over the 4000 needed.\n\nThe command I need is pretty obvious at this point. I just need to select `play_round` to start this blind. The prompt also says Boss blinds can't be skipped.\n\nTherefore, the action is `play_round`, and I don't need to specify any other information. Let's go!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
