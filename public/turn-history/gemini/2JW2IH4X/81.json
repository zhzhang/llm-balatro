{"reasoning":"**The Flush Focus**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm staring down the barrel of a `PLANET_PACK`—a Jumbo Celestial Pack, specifically—and I've got five planets to pick from. It's a classic choice, but I'm approaching this strategically. I'm seeing: Jupiter (Flush), Uranus (Two Pair), Mercury (Pair), Saturn (Straight), and Earth (Full House).\n\nMy history speaks volumes; I've hit Flush *seven* times previously, so it's a clear favorite. Plus, that Telescope voucher guarantees Jupiter is there, which is critical. I'm currently at Flush level 6, with 110 chips and a multiplier of 14. This feels good, but it's not the ceiling. I'm holding Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and two Joker Stencils in my inventory—nice tools to have.\n\nMy strategy is laser-focused: **level up the Flush**. With that in mind, the choice is clear; it's Jupiter all the way. I'm going to **select 1**, and hopefully, this will further my Flush game.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
