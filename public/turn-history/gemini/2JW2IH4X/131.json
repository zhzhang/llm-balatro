{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current Game State**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante 6, round 14. I just bought the Celestial Pack, so I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase. I have $4, which is fine for now, and the following jokers are in play: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. My immediate objective is to clear Ante 6 and set myself up well for Ante 8. The core strategy remains flush-focused – Flush is currently at Level 12, offering 200 Chips and 26 Mult.\n\nMy joker synergy is pretty strong. Odd Todd is crucial for chip generation off odd-numbered cards (Ace, 9, 7, 5, 3). Swashbuckler is providing a nice mult boost based on card sell value. Blackboard gives a crucial x3 Mult if my held cards are Spades or Clubs, and Joker Stencil is doubling the mult, currently, with one open slot.\n\nLooking at my booster pack options, I have Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Jupiter levels up my flush, specifically increasing its chips and mult. Saturn improves Straights and Uranus helps with Two Pairs. The Telescope voucher guarantees Jupiter is available, which is key.\n\nMy focus is undeniably Flush right now. Jupiter is essential for boosting my Flush level, since it offers a +2 Mult and +15 Chips. I've played Flush 11 times already, showing its significance to my game plan. My chip generation is increasing at a good rate.\n\nThe choice is pretty clear; I select Jupiter. The command is `select 1`. Let's get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
