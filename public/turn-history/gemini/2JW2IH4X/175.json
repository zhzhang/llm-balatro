{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in round 19, the ante is at 7/8 (thank goodness for that Hieroglyph voucher!), and I've got a measly $4 to work with. My Joker lineup is decent but could be better. I'm running Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil, which is a solid base. Swashbuckler is currently at a +9 Multi thanks to the sell values of the other Jokers. Joker Stencil provides a X2 multiplier, thanks to my one empty Joker slot. I have a strong flush level at 17, so that's my scoring hand focus.\n\nLooking at the shop, Constellation is out of reach at $6. Justice is also a non-starter in the shop phase since it requires card selection, and I'm not in a hand to use it. That leaves the Buffoon Pack, which is $4 and affordable. Given my limited funds and the potential to dramatically improve my Joker setup with the chance of acquiring a better Joker to use right away or a higher sell value Joker to boost Swashbuckler, the Buffoon Pack seems like the obvious play. I can't afford the reroll, so I have to make the most of this pack.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack is a perfect fit for my budget and current strategic needs. The primary goal is to improve my Joker setup, aiming for a Joker that either synergizes better with my flush strategy, or to maximize the sell value of my existing Jokers to significantly increase Swashbuckler's multiplier.\n\nTherefore, the action is clear: I'm going to buy the Buffoon Pack. The buy_booster call, with position [1], aligns perfectly with my analysis. This is the only impactful move with my current $4 and I'm confident it's the best strategic choice.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
