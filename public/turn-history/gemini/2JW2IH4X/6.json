{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Opening Hand**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 1, Buffoon Pack, $5 in the bank, and my first decision of the run. I've got two joker choices from the pack: Odd Todd and Fortune Teller.\n\nLet's break this down. Odd Todd gives me an immediate +31 chips for any odd-ranked card I play. That's *huge* in the early game. With low base chip values, that kind of flat bonus makes a massive difference in clearing blinds quickly. Fortune Teller, on the other hand, gives me +1 Mult for each Tarot card I use this run. It's a scaling joker, a long-term play, but currently useless. I haven't acquired or used any Tarot cards yet.\n\nMy immediate goal is to comfortably beat the upcoming blinds. Since I have zero Jokers, getting *any* scoring joker is my top priority. Odd Todd provides that immediate help. Fortune Teller is good, *eventually*, but it requires ramping up, and right now, chips are king. Ante 1 is all about building a foundation, and +31 chips per odd card is a solid foundation. Given my hand and my goals, I need immediate stabilization. Clearing Big and Boss blinds in Ante 1 is now much easier.\n\nTherefore, the logical choice is `Odd Todd`. It's in position 1 of the choices, so the command is `select 1`. Let's get this run started strong.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
