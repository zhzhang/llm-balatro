{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante and Preparing for the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 2, Round 5, facing \"The Window\" boss, which debuffs Diamonds. I've got $8. Let's see, my Jokers are: Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd ranks), a base Joker (+4 Mult), Blackboard (x3 Mult if all held cards are Spades/Clubs), and Joker Stencil (x2 Mult due to the empty slot). My hand levels are: High Card at Level 2, Pair at Level 1, Two Pair at Level 2, and Flush at Level 2. The shop options are To Do List (Full House payoff), Greedy Joker (Diamond suit +3 Mult), Overstock voucher, and a Reroll.\n\nRight off the bat, \"To Do List\" is useless; my build favors High Card, Flush, or Two Pair, especially with Blackboard. \"Greedy Joker\" is a non-starter with the Diamond debuff. The Overstock voucher is out of reach at $10. Rerolling is an option, but I'm thinking long-term: saving for interest is smarter at this point, and my current build seems strong enough.\n\nThe goal is to get past the boss. Previous big blind scores are ~1,600, but let's assume this boss is closer to 3,200, which feels reasonable. Let's see, with a High Card, I'm looking at (Base 15 + Ace 11 + Odd Todd 31) = 57 chips, times (Base 2 + Joker 4) * Blackboard 3 * Stencil 2 = 6 * 3 * 2 = 36 Mult, giving me a solid 2,052 chips. A Flush (using Spades/Clubs with some odd ranks) could easily hit ~100 chips and (Base 6 + 4) * 3 * 2 = 60 Mult, totaling 6,000 chips. My current build is clearly well-positioned for this ante.\n\nI have $8. Earning interest requires $5 increments, so keeping $5 will get me $1 interest, so I should keep the money. I have four Jokers, and Stencil is at x2. Should I sell the basic Joker for +4 mult? If I do that, Stencil becomes x3, but the immediate gain isn't worth the *slight* scaling decrease. The +4 mult is valuable.\n\nThe shop cards are all duds. I can't afford the voucher, and I'm confident I can beat the boss as-is. Time to save money! It's also a good idea to put +Mult before xMult in the Joker order. So the order is already optimized! 1: Odd Todd, 2: base Joker, 3: Blackboard, 4: Joker Stencil.\n\nSince I'm ready to rock and the shop has nothing, I should just move on to the round selection.\n\nWait a second - I remember using the Pluto planet. That makes my High Card strategy even safer. So, confirmed, go to `round_select`.\n\nLet's do a final check. Selling \"Joker\" for $1 is not worth it with it's value. Buying \"To Do List\" just to sell later would be a money sink. Reroll would be worse, since I would lose interest.\n\nOkay, final conclusion: Advance to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
