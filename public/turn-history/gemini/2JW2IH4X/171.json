{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 8, a critical juncture, and I've got $22 burning a hole in my pocket. The immediate goal: *crush* this Ante 8 boss. My current build is centered around Flushes, Flush Level 16 specifically, with solid additive and multiplicative joker support.\n\nI've got a killer hand with Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard and Joker Stencil. *Telescope* is a lifesaver, ensuring Planet cards are plentiful. I'm seeing *Mega Celestial Pack* in the shop and I have to seriously consider it. It's an automatic Jupiter (Flush) card because of Telescope. But, *Constellation* is also there. If I buy Constellation and use planets, it will scale well, BUT, Joker Stencil immediately goes down in value. So, no. It looks tempting, but it's a trap.\n\n*Hieroglyph* is also in the shop, which could reset back to Ante 7, giving me more scaling rounds. But, I don't want to over-think this. The key to winning is going to come from scaling the Flush hand.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Prioritize the Mega Celestial Pack:** *Telescope* makes this a no-brainer. Guaranteed Jupiter cards mean more Flush levels, which equals bigger scores and more chance of winning.\n2.  *Hieroglyph* is tempting, but not the priority. I can buy it after, if it makes sense.\n3.  *Justice* seems fine, but I don't need it.\n\nSo, my action will be `buy_booster` on position 1, which is the Mega Celestial Pack. I'm not selling anything. The joker order is perfectly optimized. The final JSON will be: `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`. And, I'll execute the plan.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
