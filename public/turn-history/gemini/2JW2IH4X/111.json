{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nOkay, so the ante is at 6/8, and I'm sitting on $5. This is the SHOP phase. I need to make some key decisions here. My current Joker setup is: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I also have the Telescope voucher and no consumables. My Flush is leveled to 10. The shop has Gluttonous Joker for $5, Uranus for $3, and the Reroll Surplus voucher for $10, which I can't afford. A reroll itself costs $5.\n\nLet's break down the shop options: Gluttonous Joker seems tempting with its potential +3 Mult on Clubs, but buying it would immediately nerf my Joker Stencil from x2 to x1 Mult because I'd be filling the last joker slot. Given my current setup, it’s a significant net loss – and I'd be killing 186 Mult for just 9 Mult! The other card, Uranus, levels Two Pair, which is useless for me given I am relying on Flush.\n\nRerolling is an option, but it would leave me broke, which isn't ideal. I need to proceed to the Blind Select.\n\nMy current build is centered around a Level 10 Flush. Odd Todd is crucial for chip generation, Swashbuckler adds a flat mult, and Blackboard has the potential for a x3 Mult, but only if *all* my cards are Spades or Clubs. Joker Stencil provides that crucial x2 Multiplier currently.\n\nI just used Trance on an Ace of Clubs. This means when I play a round and hold that Ace of Clubs in my hand at the end, I'll get a Jupiter card.\n\nI need to be mindful of Blackboard. Right now, my hand contains Hearts and Diamonds, which means I'll need to strategically discard or play those to trigger Blackboard's Multiplier in the future.\n\nMy immediate action should be `round_select`. I'm not buying Gluttonous Joker. I'm definitely not buying Uranus. There's zero reason to reroll, so I'm going to save my $5. I *might* get $1 interest, and at least I can buy something if the shop gets better next time. The value in my current setup far outweighs anything I can get right now.\n\nAlright, one last check on the math:\nIf I add Gluttonous Joker: (Base 22 + Swashbuckler 9 + Gluttonous 3 [if club]) * Stencil 1 * Blackboard 3 = 34 * 3 = 102.\nIt's a clear downgrade.\n\nI have $5. Interest is $1 per $5. So keeping $5 earns $1.\nRerolling costs $5.\n\nFinal Decision: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
