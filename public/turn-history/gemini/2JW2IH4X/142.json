{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Selection: Balancing Risk and Reward**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 15, with $4. The shop's presenting some interesting options, but I need to be strategic. My current build is centered around a Flush, Level 14, and I'm leveraging Odd Todd for chip generation and Swashbuckler for multi-based bonuses, alongside Blackboard for a x3 mult on Spades or Clubs. Joker Stencil gives a x2 multi.\n\nI'm evaluating the shop, and here's my breakdown:\n\n*   **Juggler:** +1 hand size. This would *hurt* my Joker Stencil (x2 to x1). No way.\n*   **Uranus:** Levels up Two Pair. Completely irrelevant to my Flush strategy.\n*   **Standard Pack:** Adds a playing card. Potentially useful for Spades/Clubs to activate Blackboard or odd ranks for Odd Todd. But this is where the dilemma starts.\n*   **Crystal Ball:** Too expensive.\n*   **Reroll:** Too expensive.\n\nI'm weighing my options: a Standard Pack or saving the $4. Since I don't get interest, saving the money does nothing. I'm focusing on consistency. My hand is relying on specific Joker cards and a Flush, not a Two Pair. The Standard Pack is a gamble, but I stand to gain more than if I do nothing.\n\nI'm thinking, \"if I buy the Standard Pack, I might be lucky enough to get a card that helps the Blackboard condition or provides more chips for Odd Todd\".\n\nLet's look at the \"Last Played Hand\": 77,922 chips. The Boss for Ante 7 (Small Blind) will require more, but not an astronomical amount yet. I need to balance the potential of a lucky card with the immediate need to move forward.\n\nI have $4, and a Standard Pack costs $4. This is a low-risk move to see if I can improve my deck consistency for Blackboard/Odd Todd. It's time to test my luck. There's no reason to save the money. The Standard Pack provides more chances for success, while saving is a detriment.\n\nI will `buy_booster 1` (Standard Pack) because it's the best option to improve my deck. Let's see what the cards hold.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
