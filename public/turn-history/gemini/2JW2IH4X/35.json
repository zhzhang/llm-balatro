{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Planet Pack: A Tactical Evaluation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in Ante 2, Round 5, pre-boss, and the \"Window\" blind is up. Diamond cards are debuffed, so we need to adjust. I've got $8, and the game step is `PLANET_PACK`. Time to make some critical choices. My Jokers are: Odd Todd (chips for odds), a generic Joker (+4 Mult), Blackboard (x3 Mult for Spades/Clubs), and Joker Stencil (x2 Mult because I have one empty Joker slot). Max Jokers is 5, so I've got one slot open.\n\nMy current hand levels are Flush at Level 2 (50 Chips, 6 Mult), Two Pair at Level 2 (40 Chips, 3 Mult), and High Card at Level 1 (5 Chips, 1 Mult). Four of a Kind is Level 1, and Straight Flush is also at Level 1.\n\nThe Planet Pack options are: Mars (Four of a Kind, +30 chips, +3 Mult), Neptune (Straight Flush, +40 chips, +4 Mult), and Pluto (High Card, +10 chips, +1 Mult).\n\nGiven my Blackboard Joker, I'm leaning toward strategies that favor Spades/Clubs. That makes Flush, Two Pair, and High Card easier to maintain, especially since I don't need a specific hand shape, just to discard or play the diamonds/hearts.\n\nI've been playing a decent amount of Flush, but Four of a Kind and Straight Flush are rare. High Card is my most reliable fallback, especially with Blackboard. Leveling it up would make \"stalling\" more profitable. Let's revisit the hand stats. Flush is currently (50x6), Two Pair (40x3) and High Card (5x1).\n\nIf I take Mars, 4OAK becomes 90x10. If Neptune, Straight Flush becomes 140x12, and Pluto, High Card is now 15x2. Considering my strong multipliers already, I need to focus on base chips and base multipliers.\n\nLet's quickly check Joker Stencil: it gives X1 mult for each empty Joker slot. I currently have 4 Jokers, with 1 empty slot. That makes it X2, which means the general rule `Max Slots - (Current Jokers - 1)` holds.\n\nBack to the Planet choices, Mars (4OAK) is generally better than Pluto (High Card) in theory. Straight Flush is too rare to seriously consider.\n\nNow, is High Card a viable build? If I play High Card Level 2: (15 chips) x (2 Mult + 4 Joker) * 2 (Stencil) * 3 (Blackboard) = 15 * 6 * 2 * 3 = 540 chips.\n\nIf I play a Flush Level 2: (50 chips + card chips) x (6 Mult + 4 Joker) * 2 * 3 = (50+~50) * 10 * 6 = 6000 chips. Flush is stronger.\n\nGiven my hand levels, none of the planets (Mars, Neptune, Pluto) directly improve my main hands (Flush/Two Pair). But I do have Blackboard, so I can pivot to a high card strategy.\n\nIf I'm forced to use High Card, Pluto is my best bet. With Blackboard, even High Card is legitimate. With Odd Todd in the mix, if I get a High Card of an Ace, I can generate 2052 chips. To be more precise, Mars would give 4x9s + 36 base chips + 31*4 Odd Todd bonus chips * 14 mult * 6 mult = 21,000. So Mars is higher upside.\n\nTo beat \"The Window,\" (1600 chips), High Card (Ace): is 1410 chips. With Pluto (Level 2) it's 2052 chips, guaranteeing the win. The goal here is consistency. Mars is a \"win harder\" card here. Pluto is a \"consistency\" card.\n\nThe choice is now between: Mars, Neptune, and Pluto. I'm picking Pluto. It's the most reliable for my current strategy.\n\nDo I need deck manipulation for 4OAK? Probably, and I haven't seen any Tarot cards yet. Let's re-evaluate: should I sell the generic Joker to boost the Stencil multiplier from X2 to X3?\nCurrent: (Base Mult + 4) * 2 * 3 = (Base Mult + 4) * 6.\nIf I sell Joker (+\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
