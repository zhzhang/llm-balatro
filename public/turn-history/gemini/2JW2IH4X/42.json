{"reasoning":"**Strategic Flush Optimization: Choosing Jupiter**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 6, with an ante of 3/8. I'm in the PLANET\\_PACK phase, specifically a Celestial Pack. I've got $3 left. Let's see, my current hand setup... I'm holding Odd Todd, which gives me a chip boost for odd cards, a standard +4 Multiplier Joker, the Blackboard for a 3x Multiplier on Spade/Club hands, and a Joker Stencil that's partially filled, giving a 2x Multiplier. My Telescope voucher is active, meaning the pack will feature my most-played hand, which is Flush.\n\nMy Flush is at Level 2, currently giving me 50 Chips and a 6x Multiplier. I've played it three times already this run. I see I have the choice between Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth.\n\nThe Telescope worked perfectly, and I've got Jupiter, as expected, as a Flush planet. This is great because it will boost my Flush to Level 3, which is the clear choice given my strategy and the presence of Blackboard. Blackboard is key with its 3x multiplier when using a hand comprised solely of clubs and spades, so I need to play those cards to get maximum value from the blackboard.\n\nNeptune for Straight Flush and Earth for Full House are not as relevant to my current build. My goal is clear: select Jupiter.\n\nSo, the command will be `select 1`, since Jupiter is the first card in the pack. My action is \"select\", the position is [1], and the hand type and estimated chips are irrelevant here. I'm going for the Flush upgrade with Jupiter!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
