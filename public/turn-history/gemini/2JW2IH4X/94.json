{"reasoning":"**The Deep Dive: High Priestess vs. The Hanged Man**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5/8, Round 11. I’m staring down this Mega Arcana Pack. Money's at $6, Jokers are Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. The goal is to maximize score with Flushes and that sweet Blackboard multiplier. The hand is already all Spades/Clubs thanks to that \"The World\" card. Blackboard is currently online.\n\nRight now, the choices are: The Hanged Man (destroy 2), The High Priestess (2 planets), The Wheel of Fortune (risky!), and The Fool, which will be \"The World\" again. All current cards are Spades/Clubs; “The World” doesn’t help in hand, but could help the deck down the line. I'm leaning heavily towards deck thinning or a potential Jupiter.\n\nI've got an 8-level Flush and the current strategy is built around that and the Blackboard (X3 mult). Odd Todd, however, isn’t being very helpful at the moment, with the current hand. My deck is heavy with even cards, and thinning is tempting to increase the odds.\n\nThe Fool would copy \"The World\" but it’s basically useless right now, as my hand is fixed. The High Priestess... well, a Jupiter would be amazing for the flush. The Hanged Man is the safe play for long-term consistency. But I have to choose.\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth, I *really* want Jupiter. Planets are generally better value than thinning just two cards in a deck of 50+. Even if I get a bad one, they are worth something.\n\nThe Hanged Man *is* reliable for thinning and would remove those pesky even cards, which helps Odd Todd. The Fool is gone because I already have a fixed hand. So that leaves High Priestess and Hanged Man.\n\nBut wait, I am in a Mega Pack so, no, The Fool is out of the question (I chose The World as the first choice). This is selection 2.\n\nSince I have Blackboard and all cards are already black, I can’t \"improve\" this hand. I should choose something for value in this case. The High Priestess is the clear front-runner here. I'm going to take a chance on Jupiter. The Hanged Man could offer more consistent draws. *However*, two planets offer more value.\n\nI just double-checked, it's High Priestess. No targets, immediate effect. High Priestess is the play. I'll stick with that. Let's make it happen. I will pick High Priestess (position 2).\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
