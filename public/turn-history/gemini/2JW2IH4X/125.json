{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: The World**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, Round 13. My immediate thought is, what's the best move here to maximize the Flush strategy and leverage Blackboard's multiplier? Looking at the hand, I see a clear path. With the `TAROT_PACK` step, The World seems like the obvious choice. I have a Queen, Ace, and 2 of Spades already, but the hand also has some Hearts that are messing up the Blackboard condition. I need all Spades/Clubs for that sweet x3 multiplier, so I must start by converting those Hearts.\n\nThe World is the best pack here.\n\nThe Empress offers a Multiplier boost, but I'm thinking long-term: The deck modification for Blackboard is the priority. The Judgement joker is too much of a gamble since the Stencil's x2 is pretty solid. I need to make sure the hand is set up to benefit from the blackboard.\n\nNow, let's look at the hand: the King, 7, 3, and 2 of Hearts at positions 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively. I can convert up to three cards with the World. The World needs the 7 and 3 since I have Odd Todd and its bonus with the odd ranks. The King and 2 are even, so it makes no difference. I'll convert the King, 7, and 3.\n\nLet's refine the plan: the action is \"select,\" and the positions array should be \\[1, 4, 5, 6] (The World, King, 7, 3 of Hearts). I'm confident about that. I need to convert 3 Hearts to Spades to support Blackboard, and this choice does it.\n\nThe JSON schema looks okay, everything seems correct. Let's send the command. Done.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,6]"}
