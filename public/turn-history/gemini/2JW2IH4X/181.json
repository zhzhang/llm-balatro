{"reasoning":"**Strategic Round Transition: Optimizing for the Next Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: We're at Ante 7/8, Round 19, in the SHOP phase. My finances are a bit precarious at -$6, courtesy of selling the Credit Card to maximize Joker Stencil. I've got a solid Joker setup: Odd Todd (+31 Chips for odd rank cards), Blackboard (x3 Mult if hand is Spades/Clubs - independent Joker check), Joker Stencil (x2 Mult), and Constellation (x1 Mult, scales with Planets - independent Joker check). We have Justice in our consumables. I have Telescope and Hieroglyph as Vouchers. My Flush is at Level 17 (highest hand level). The shop is completely empty – no cards, no boosters, no vouchers, and a $5 reroll cost I can't afford.\n\nThe Justice consumable can't be used in the shop; it needs a target (playing cards in hand). I don't need to sell Justice. The current Joker order is good for now, especially with the Stencil at x2. I've evaluated the Joker's activation order, confirming that the chips are summed before multipliers. I have the best Joker order. The shop is empty. The Credit Card is sold, and the Stencil has updated. Buying, selling, or rerolling is out of the question due to lack of funds and lack of anything to buy.\n\nMy key strategy here is to advance to the next round. I've optimized my Joker setup, the Justice consumable is primed, and the shop is offering nothing. The debt doesn't stop me from playing. I'm ready to move forward. The shop confirms the current state, and the remaining action is to select the next round. Action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
