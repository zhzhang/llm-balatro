{"reasoning":"**Ante 3/8, Round 6 Decision Time**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 3, Round 6, $7 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Odd Todd for the odd ranks, a standard Joker and Joker Stencil, and Blackboard to boost Spades/Clubs. The Telescope voucher I just bought guarantees Jupiter in my next Celestial Pack, which is *huge* for my Flush strategy. I've been running Flush consistently, and the Telescope solidifies that play.\n\nLooking at the Shop... *Delayed Gratification* is tempting for the long game but clashes with Blackboard and its discard dependency. Not a good fit now. *Shoot the Moon* is interesting for the +13 Mult on Queens, but that’s not my primary focus now. I need the Spades/Clubs for Blackboard. That leaves me with the boosters.\n\nThe *Standard Pack* is a gamble, potentially building the deck, but I'm tight on cash. Then there's the *Celestial Pack*, which is a no-brainer with Telescope. Guaranteed Jupiter. Jupiter will significantly upgrade the Flush hand which is my most played strategy, as well as the Telescope voucher.\n\nAlright, I have $7. The Celestial Pack costs $4. After purchasing it, I'll have $3 left. That's a good trade. The Celestial Pack is the clear priority here to capitalize on the Telescope.\n\nSo, I need to buy the Celestial Pack. Let's use `buy_booster 2`. That's the play.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
