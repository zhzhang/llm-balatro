{"reasoning":"**The Value of the Unknown**\n\nOkay, Ante 4, Round 10. Time to think this through. I've got $5 and the Big Blind is looming – 7,500 chips needed. The enticing \"Ethereal Tag\" option pops up, a free Spectral Pack. The upcoming boss, \"The Eye,\" forces me to play only one hand type this round, needing 10,000 chips. My Jokers are Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. The potential mult is (Base + 9) * 3 * 2 = (Base + 9) * 6, and I'm heavily leaning on Flushes – specifically, Spades and Clubs if possible to trigger Blackboard's x3 mult.\n\nMy base Flush is level 8, giving me 140 chips and 18 mult. With the Jokers, that balloons to an estimated 37,746 with Blackboard's x3 (233 chips * 162 mult). Even without Blackboard, I'm easily above the required score. My run is stable, but I could always use more power for later rounds.\n\nThe Spectral Packs are the classic high risk/high reward, offering insane upside but potentially crippling downsides. Skipping means losing the shop and immediate gold, but the Boss Blind's restriction is *perfect* for my flush-focused build. Plus, an Ethereal Tag could provide a game-changing boost like a Red Seal, Polychrome, or a rare Joker. Given my strength, I can *easily* handle the Boss Blind without the extra shop visit from the Big Blind. Wait, my strategy already IS \"play only one hand type\". The Boss Blind is not a problem. So, is the tag worth it? Yes. Spectral packs are generally much higher value than a single shop visit, especially with a meager $5, so I'm not likely to find much to buy anyway.\n\nOkay, let's look at the current hand from last shop visit. Ace(S), 5(S), and Jack(C) are black. King(H), 4(H), 10(D), 8(D), 4(D) are red. To trigger Blackboard, I need *all* cards to be Spades or Clubs. If I play a Flush of Spades/Clubs, the remaining cards in hand must also be Spades/Clubs. So, red cards disable Blackboard, and I need to start discarding aggressively or find a way to manipulate the deck. Does skipping help? Maybe (Immolate can destroy cards, including red ones). Playing helps because it could let me find Tarot cards or Strength/Death cards to convert my reds.\n\nLet's do the math without Blackboard: (18 + 9) * 2 = 54 mult. With the cards I play, I should have ~233 chips. That's 12,582 total, even *without* the x3. That's *still* more than enough to beat both blinds. So, the risk of skipping is very low.\n\nIs there *any* reason to *not* skip? I mean, I *would* get $4 and interest for playing. But, the Ethereal Tag gives a *free* Spectral Pack. Spectral cards... the potential upside is huge. There's Incantation (bad), Grim (bad), Talisman (good), Aura (good), Wraith (risky but potentially run-winning), Sigil (EXCELLENT for Blackboard/Flushes), Ouija (high risk), Ankh (risky), Hex (good if it hits Stencil or Blackboard), and Immolate (EXCELLENT for Blackboard/Economy).\n\nSo, the potential upside of a Spectral pack is very high, so I will `skip_round`. I need to make sure the schema is right. Also, before I submit, the request is for one JSON-formatted action to the server. Wait, I should also check if rearranging Jokers will help. Current order is Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, Joker Stencil. It's calculated correctly: (Base + Played Cards + Todd) * (Base Mult + Swashbuckler) * Blackboard * Stencil. The additive modifiers should be before multiplicative ones, so that order is optimal because Todd is chips, before any mult.\n\nSo, I've got this. My decision is clear: Skip round for the Ethereal Tag. And since I'm skipping, I'm not playing a hand, so `null` is correct for \"estimated_chips\". One last check: Boss Blind is \"Play only 1 hand type\". I'm playing Flushes anyway, so this is no problem.\n\n`action`: \"skip_round\"\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
