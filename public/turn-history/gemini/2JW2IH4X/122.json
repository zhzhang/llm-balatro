{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decisions**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 6/8, Round 13. I've got $9 to work with in the shop. My primary goal is to maximize my Flush scaling and overall deck consistency, focusing on Spades and Clubs to boost my Blackboard Joker. I'm leveraging the Telescope voucher to guarantee a Jupiter card in Celestial Packs which will level up my flush. I've already used Jupiter this round, so I need to make the next best choice.\n\nMy Jokers are: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. The Blackboard’s multiplication depends on having only Spades and Clubs.\n\nMy current shop options are:\n\n*   Pluto card: $3 (High Card level up) - Not my main strategy.\n*   Lusty Joker: $5 (+3 Mult for Hearts) - This is not a great choice right now because it doesn’t mesh well with Blackboard.\n*   Celestial Pack: $4 (Guaranteed Jupiter card thanks to the Telescope voucher) - This is a priority.\n*   Arcana Pack: $4 (Deck modification possibilities – card conversion for Blackboard synergy, or enhancing/removing cards) - Useful to support Blackboard.\n\nI'm thinking: Given that I have Telescope, the Celestial Pack is a must-buy for that guaranteed Jupiter card and Flush level. With my remaining money, I'm going to grab an Arcana Pack as well to continue the blackboard strategy.\n\nSo, I will buy the Celestial Pack first.\n\nMy next immediate action is to buy the Celestial Pack at position 1. That's the best option here.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
