{"reasoning":"**Here's how I'm thinking about this turn:**\n\nOkay, Ante 4, and I have $12 to work with. The shop has some interesting options: Celestial Pack, Standard Pack, Reserved Parking, The Star, and Overstock Voucher. My main focus is on a Flush build, so I need to prioritize cards that'll support that. My Jokers are Odd Todd, a standard Joker, and Blackboard. Blackboard's great because it gives a massive x3 multiplier if I play only Spades/Clubs. So, any purchase should align with that strategy.\n\n\"The Star\" is out immediately; it converts cards to Diamonds, which is the exact opposite of what Blackboard needs. \"Reserved Parking\" could give me some money back, but it could also give me cards that are the wrong suits, so it's not a priority. \n\nBetween the packs, Celestial and Standard, Celestial seems better. There's a chance to get a Planet card that can seriously level up my Flush. Standard Pack is random, so it's less appealing. The Overstock Voucher is tempting, because more shop slots are always good long-term.\n\nI'm currently at $12. Buying Overstock would leave me with $2 (losing interest). If I buy Celestial Pack or Standard Pack, I will lose $4. I'll get some interest if I buy one of the packs. I'm prioritizing getting enough power to beat 800-1600 chips easily. Blackboard is already giving a huge boost, and a Celestial Pack is likely to give another.\n\nThe Celestial Pack is the clear choice to help me scale in scoring. Buying Overstock is also good for the long-term, but it can wait for now. The current Jokers are enough for the present, so I don't need to reroll the shop. I should double-check the shop cards, though. The Star converts to Diamonds, which I definitely don't want. Reserved Parking is okay, but not great since it might conflict.\n\nI've decided to buy the Celestial Pack. I'm going to buy the Celestial Pack, which has a good chance of giving me a great Planet (like Jupiter for the Flush). Now I need to choose an action. I should use `buy_booster` with the pack's position (1). The command should be `buy_booster 1`.\n\nJust double-checking: the Celestial Pack costs $4. After buying, I'll have $8 left.\n\nBefore I commit, I'm thinking about Overstock again. Should I buy that instead? Overstock costs $10, which would leave me with $2. The Celestial Pack is the better option for short-term gain. If I buy it now, I can potentially buy Overstock in the next shop if I win.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I have $12.\nBuy Celestial Pack ($4) -> Money $8.\nThe Celestial Pack is \"used immediately\".\nThen I can see if I want to buy anything else.\n\nLet's start with `buy_booster` position 1.\n\nThe prompt is for one action.\n\nAction: `buy_booster`\nPosition: 1\n\n(Checking Schema)\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\nActually, the schema says `positions` is an array of integers.\n\"buy_booster <booster_pack_position>\"\nThe example \"buy_booster 1\" would map to `positions: [1]`.\n\nLet's re-read: \"Besides scalars, boolean, and null, other values must be double-quoted as valid strings. ... If a user requests multiple JSON, always return a single parseable JSON array. ... follow the schema\".\n\nWait, the schema for `buy_booster` does not exist in the provided context's `action` enum?\nAvailable actions in schema: `[\"use_consumable\", \"sell_consumable\", \"rearrange_jokers\", \"sell_joker\", \"buy_card\", \"buy_booster\", \"buy_voucher\", \"buy_and_use_consumable\", \"round_select\", \"reroll_shop\"]`.\nYes, `buy_booster` is there.\n\nIs there any reason to `buy_card` Reserved Parking? No.\nIs there any reason to `buy_voucher` Overstock? Yes, but Celestial Pack is usually higher priority for power scaling.\n\nLet's go with `buy_booster` 1.\n\nWait, I should check if there are better options.\nStandard Pack ($4): Standard packs are generally lower value than Celestial unless you have specific synergies.\nCelestial Pack ($4): High value for Flush build\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
