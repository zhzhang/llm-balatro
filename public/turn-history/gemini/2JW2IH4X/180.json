{"reasoning":"**Current Round Optimization: Selling the Credit Card**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 19, Ante 7/8, and the shop is empty. I've got -$7 in the bank, but the Credit Card lets me go to -$20. I've already bought the items I wanted this round – Justice (to enhance a card later) and Constellation. My main focus now is maximizing the score for the upcoming round.\n\nMy current Joker lineup is Odd Todd (chips), Blackboard (x3 Spades/Clubs Mult), Joker Stencil (currently x1), Credit Card (debt), and Constellation (scaling mult). The Stencil multiplier is what I need to optimize, since it is a multiplier in itself and the scaling mult from Constellation will matter.\n\nJoker Stencil is only providing X1 right now, because all my joker slots are filled. Selling the Credit Card is the clear move, as it will free up a slot, which will double Joker Stencil's multiplier to X2, which is worth way more than the $1.\n\nI checked my debt situation. Selling the Credit Card ($1) will move me to -$6. Selling the Credit Card will **not** trigger a game over, since I can already go into debt. It just prevents me from buying more stuff until I get back into the black.\n\nI've verified the math on Joker Stencil. Currently, it's X1 because all slots are filled. Selling the Credit Card will free up one slot, making it X2, which is a significant boost.\n\nSince there's nothing else to buy in the shop, selling the Credit Card is the best move here. I just need to make the `sell_joker` call with the correct position. The Credit Card is in position 4 in my current hand.\n\nSo, the optimal move is: Sell the Credit Card. The action is `sell_joker 4`. I'm ready for the round select.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
