{"reasoning":"**Round 14 Strategy: The Head Blind**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante is 6/8, we're in Round 14, facing \"The Head\" blind, and need 40,000 chips. The Boss effect is debuffing Hearts, but that shouldn't matter too much since I'm focusing on Blackboard anyway. I've got a Flush Level 13, currently at 215 Chips and 28 Mult, which is a good base.\n\nMy Jokers are key here. I've got Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. The real money maker is the Blackboard. To maximize Blackboard, I need all Spades or Clubs in my hand, meaning I want to get rid of my Hearts and Diamonds. I need the Stencil for more Multiplier.\n\nI have zero cash, so no shopping or consumables. The only real play is to, well, play. Given that we're in the BLIND\\_SELECT phase and the blind is \"The Head\", the logical move here is to use `play_round`. No other action is even possible or required. I'll stick to this basic plan and see what I can do.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
