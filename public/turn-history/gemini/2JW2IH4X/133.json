{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis for Ante 6, Round 14: The Head Boss Fight**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm staring down The Head, and the pressure is on to hit that chip threshold, which likely means at least 60,000 chips.  This is a *Flush* game. My hand is: 10 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 4 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds. I have a few Jokers to consider: *Odd Todd* is nice for odd ranks, *Swashbuckler* boosts mult based on Joker sell value, *Blackboard* is huge (X3 multiplier if *all* held cards are Spades or Clubs), and *Joker Stencil* adds another multiplier (X2 in this case, due to one empty slot). Currently I have a Flush at Level 13, for 215 Chips and 28 Mult, before modifiers.\n\nNow, I'm presented with a *Tarot Pack* and I have to choose between *The Sun* (Hearts conversion), *The Hierophant* (Bonus card, +30 chips), and *The Empress* (+4 mult to cards).  I *immediately* rule out *The Sun*. The Head debuffs Hearts, and Blackboard hates Hearts. It's a non-starter.\n\nMy strategy revolves around Blackboard. All cards *held in hand* must be Spades or Clubs. Thus, I need to either discard Hearts and Diamonds, or make the best of what I have. I need to make some decisions.\n\nSince I am playing a flush, I need a suit. I don't have a flush. I need to enhance cards and then find the flush, and the cards will stay in my deck.\n\nHierophant is looking good, but I need to make sure I *enhance* the correct cards. My hand contains two of each suit. I need to target the Spades and the Clubs to help the flush and Blackboard. Should I do the +30 chips or the +4 mult? +30 chips is about a 14% increase on the base, while +4 mult is also about a 11% increase. Since I have Swashbuckler, I already have a decent mult. \n\nSo, I need to choose between +30 chips (Hierophant) or +4 mult (Empress).  The chips are more reliable for beating the threshold. With Hierophant on a card, I need to score a flush that satisfies Blackboard.\n\nI’m thinking I’ll put the Hierophant cards on the 10 of Spades and the 10 of Clubs.\n\nLet’s quickly analyze that choice. The initial scores are 215 chips / 28 mult.  I have two Jokers, Stencil and Blackboard, which give me a X3 (Blackboard) and X2 (Stencil), to give me a total of 222 mult, for a score of 47,730. If I use Hierophant (+30 chips on one card): (215+30) * 222 = 245 * 222 = 54,390. I can enhance two cards. (215+60) * 222 = 275 * 222 = 61,050. This is very good.\n \nAnd that’s the play!  Hierophant it is, and I'll use it on the 10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs. This should help secure the win.\n\nFinal check on command: `select 2 1 5`. *Select* is the action, `2` picks Hierophant, and `1` and `5` target the 10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs, respectively. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,5]"}
