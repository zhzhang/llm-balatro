{"reasoning":"**My Assessment for the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in `PLANET_PACK` and it's Round 17 with an ante of 7/8. I have $5 and my objective is clear: maximize my score for the upcoming Boss Blind. My primary strategy is a Level 15 Flush, and I have Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil Jokers in play.\n\nGiven my `PLANET_PACK` choices, the telescope voucher guarantees that Jupiter is in the options and I'm looking at these packs: Jupiter (Flush level up), Earth (Full House Level up) and Mars (Four of a Kind Level up). My dominant play, and the strategy I've been focusing on, is the Flush (played 14 times, Level 15).\n\nJupiter is the clear best choice. Choosing Jupiter will push my Flush to Level 16 (260 base chips, 34 base mult). Given that the Jupiter pack is in position 1, I need to `select 1`.\n\nLet's break down the projected score after the `select` action. The Flush will net 260 base chips, then I have the Odd Todd contribution (assuming five odd cards at the table), which brings in another $5 * 31 = 155 chips. Add a rough average of $5*7=35$ cards chip gain. This totals 450 chips. My base mult is 34, then Swashbuckler provides +9 mult, so that's 43 total mult. Considering the Blackboard (x3) and Joker Stencil (x2) multipliers, my total mult is $43 * 3 * 2 = 258$. This leaves me with a total score of $450 * 258 = 116,100$. This is well beyond my previous high score for a Big Blind.\n\nSo, I will take the action to `select` and the `position` is 1 for Jupiter. Based on this, I'm expecting a Flush, with an estimated score of 116,100 based on Level 16 calculations.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON action is valid, without comments, only double quotes for strings, and a single JSON object.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
