{"reasoning":"**Initial Assessment and Goal Setting**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 6/8, Round 13. Gotta hit 20,000 chips. I've got a decent hand, and some useful Jokers: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. Plus the Telescope voucher - Jupiter for Flush. Money's not a problem. The hand right now is: Queen of Spades, Jack of Spades (Foil!), 10 of Spades, 6 of Hearts (a problem!), Ace of Clubs (Blue Seal - *gotta* keep this!), Queen of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, and 2 of Diamonds (another problem!).\n\n**Problem Identification and Constraints**\n\nAlright, immediate issues: those Hearts and Diamonds *have* to go, they are not Clubs or Spades, Blackboard won't trigger with them in my hand. The Ace of Clubs *must* stay in hand to get the Jupiter planet card bonus. My current hand has a Flush, but it's not complete: I have 3 Spades and 3 Clubs (including the Ace). I can't keep the Ace *and* use it in the winning Flush and get the seal. I *must* play *a hand* with the Ace held at the end of the round.\n\n**Strategy Formulation: Flush or Bust**\n\nSo, Blackboard is the key. I need to force all cards in the *played* hand to be Spades or Clubs. I have to ditch those Heart and Diamond cards! I need to discard the 6 of Hearts and the 2 of Diamonds. Now, do I stick with that, or dig for a full Flush? I'm leaning towards the Spade Flush. 15 Spades are left in the deck. My current hand gives me good odds, especially if I can keep the Jack of Spades (Foil) for the bonus. I have 3 discards. A Flush with Blackboard and those multipliers should easily get me over the 20,000 chip target.\n\n**Refinement: Flush Fishing and Card Evaluation**\n\nLet's discard 4, 6, 7, and 8. The Hearts and Diamonds are out. This leaves Qs, Js, 10s, and Ac. Now I draw 4. I can also play 3 discards. That leaves me with a good chance to complete a Flush. The question is, should I discard the 10 of Spades for an odd card, maybe for Odd Todd? Nah, keep the Spades to make a Flush. Discard 4, 6, 7, and 8. That will make my chance of hitting the Blackboard, with the flush and the Ace, really good. That Jack of Spades will be great. And the Blue Seal!\n\n**Final Decision and JSON Output**\n\nOkay, final check: positions 4, 6, 7, and 8: Those cards are out. I want to keep the Spades and the Ace of Clubs. I am going to discard: 6 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, and 2 of Diamonds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"discard\", \"positions\": [4, 6, 7, 8], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,6,7,8]"}
