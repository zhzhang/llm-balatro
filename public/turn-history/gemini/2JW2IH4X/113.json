{"reasoning":"**My Strategy: Flush and Blackboard**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Small Blind with 20,000 chips, and the ante is at 6 for round 13. My immediate goal is to *reach* 20,000 chips. I have a decent hand with some promising Jokers. Odd Todd gives me +31 chips for odd-ranked cards, Swashbuckler provides +9 Mult based on the sell value of my other Jokers (2+3+4), Blackboard gives me x3 Mult if all my held cards are Spades or Clubs, and Joker Stencil is x2 Mult. I also have the Blue Seal Ace of Clubs, which I need for the Planet card (Jupiter).\n\nCurrently, my hand has a Queen and Jack of Spades, an Ace of Hearts, a 7, 4 and 2 of Hearts, an Ace of Clubs, and a 3 of Diamonds. I want to build a Flush for a Level 10 hand, which is already worth 170 chips and a 22 Multiplier. My main objective is to keep that Ace of Clubs for the Jupiter card to get the bonus.\n\nBlackboard is crucial here; to activate it, I need all my cards to be Spades or Clubs. Currently, my hand has too many Hearts and a single Diamond.  I need to get rid of the Ace, 7, 4, and 2 of Hearts, and also the 3 of Diamonds.\n\nSince I have 5 non-Spade/Club cards, I need to discard them. That means I will discard positions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 - the Ace, 7, 4, and 2 of Hearts, and the 3 of Diamonds.  This should give me the best chance of drawing a Spade/Club Flush and triggering Blackboard.\n\nOnce I discard, I'll need to re-evaluate the hand. I have to keep that Ace of Clubs in my hand for the Jupiter card later on, but hopefully, after my discard, I can find a flush with only Spades or Clubs.\n\nAction: Discard positions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,8]"}
