{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Celestial Pack Time!**\n\nOkay, here we are in the shop again. I've got $17, and the plan from last turn was pretty straightforward: buy Jupiter, which I did, then prioritize that Jumbo Celestial Pack for the Flush upgrade. I need to keep that plan in mind, the Celestial Pack is looking *very* tempting.\n\nI'm thinking about the Jokers I have: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard (that x3 for Spades/Clubs is crucial), and Joker Stencil (currently x2, which is huge). I've got one empty slot. I briefly considered the Blue Joker, but I know that's not the right move. I need to protect that Joker Stencil bonus! If I buy it, I lose a lot of that x2. The numbers don’t lie, even with the added chips, the overall mult would tank. I crunched the numbers, and the Blue Joker is a no-go.\n\nNow, that Jumbo Arcana Pack is an option and I like the idea of it. The potential to snag some Tarot cards and boost the deck is appealing but I'm going to have to make a tough call. Buying the Arcana pack would leave me with $5, which is just the bare minimum for interest. I’m thinking the potential boost to the Flush with the celestial pack will be more beneficial long term.\n\nAlright, back to the plan: I'm sticking with buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack. Jupiter will give a nice upgrade to the Flush and I'll keep the plan going.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
