{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nAlright, I'm in Ante 5, Round 11 of Balatro. Currently sitting on $6. My immediate goal is to make it to Ante 8, so I'm focusing on a Flush strategy, with Blackboard as my primary multiplier (X3 on Spades/Clubs).\n\nLooking at my inventory, I've got Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I also have Pluto (High Card) and Neptune (Straight Flush). The shop is offering Smeared Joker, Uranus, a Standard Pack, Seed Money, and a Reroll.\n\nSmeared Joker is a no-go at $7, since I only have $6 and it eats a Joker slot, hurting Joker Stencil and Blackboard. Uranus for $3 doesn't fit my current strategy. Seed Money is too expensive, and the Reroll is tempting at $5, but I can't afford it either right now.\n\nI could buy the Standard Pack for $4, leaving me with $2. However, I have both Pluto and Neptune, and I can use the consumables to free up some space, or sell them if I need the cash. I *could* also just level up High Card (Pluto), it's a good safety net. Selling them would net me $2, so I could then buy Smeared Joker. No, that won't work, since it hurts my Joker Stencil and Blackboard.\n\nWith Flushes at level 8, I need to progress. Let's see...Odd Todd's chip bonus for odd ranks is nice. Blackboard gives X3 if my cards are black, which is my focus. Joker Stencil will give me X2 (as I have one Joker slot open). Swashbuckler boosts the mult, and currently adds +9 mult.\n\nI've got $6. Selling the consumables gives $8.\nPluto (High Card) levels up to 3. Neptune (Straight Flush) level up is always useful.\n\nI remember I have Telescope. It makes Celestial Packs always contain the most played hand, which is Flush in this case. I should save my money for those packs!\n\nTherefore, the best action is to use Pluto. It gives me a High Card level 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
