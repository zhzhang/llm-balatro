{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Ante 8, Final Push**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 8, final ante, and the clock is ticking. This is it. I need to maximize my score to get through the final boss. Right now, I'm playing a Flush strategy, and I have some serious Blackboard synergy going, which is *critical*. I have Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. Currently, I am sitting on $8, which, frankly, isn't enough for comfort. My hand right now is all Spades and Clubs, so Blackboard is active.\n\nI've got a few options in front of me: \"The World,\" \"The Empress,\" \"The Wheel of Fortune,\" \"The Moon,\" and \"Temperance.\" \"The World\" and \"The Moon\" would turn cards into Spades and Clubs, respectively. \"The Empress\" would give +4 mult on two cards, and \"The Wheel of Fortune\" is a gamble with a 25% chance of something good. \"Temperance\" gives me $11.\n\nGiven my low cash, and that my hand is *already* all Spades and Clubs, Temperance seems like the most logical choice. It boosts me to $19, allowing me to buy \"The Drunkard\" for $4 and potentially a Celestial pack, which I really want to see with Telescope. The \"World\" and \"Moon\" don't help now because my hand is Spades/Clubs. \"The Empress\" is solid but additive; \"The Wheel of Fortune\" is a gamble I don't need right now.\n\nNow, I'm second-guessing myself... Let's look at this again. My hand is 10S, 6S, 3S, 2S, KC, 9C, 8C, 5C. I can use The World to make more Spades. I can use The Empress to make mult cards.\nMy deck has 14 non-black cards. The World would reduce that to 11.\nOkay, Temperance is *strong* because I'm low on cash ($8). $11 brings me to $19, allowing me to comfortably buy Drunkard and potentially a Jupiter from a future pack.\n\n\"Temperance\" will give me guaranteed resources. I need to get those Jupiter cards because I have Telescope. I'll need rerolls for those packs. This is a \"must-win\" scenario. Gambling isn't it.\n\nAlright, double-check the command. It's a `select` action. Temperance is in the fifth slot. No hand card positions are needed. The prompt says that. `select 5`.\n\nOkay, I'm going to take a final look at all options again.\nEmpress? Mult is additive. Okay but I don't *need* that right now.\nWheel of Fortune? A gamble.\nWorld/Moon? Deck fixing. Nope.\nTemperance is the most reliable choice to enable more shop actions.\n\nTemperance it is. Action is `select`. Positions are `[5]`. The hand type isn't relevant here. I don't even have to discard any cards or target anything. \"Temperance\" it is. And I'm ready to roll.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [5],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
