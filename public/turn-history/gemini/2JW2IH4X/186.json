{"reasoning":"**Initial Assessment and Strategy Formulation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in Ante 7, Round 19, facing a boss blind. The immediate goal is to hit 70,000 chips, which I'm confident we can achieve with the current setup. The boss's specific effect, \"Forces 1 card to always be selected,\" is the wildcard, but I'm prepared. I have a negative balance of $6, so I *need* to win.\n\n**Joker Evaluation**\n\nMy Jokers are: Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd ranks), Blackboard (x3 Mult if all cards in hand are Spades/Clubs), Joker Stencil (x2 Mult - 2 slots empty), and Constellation (x1 Mult). Blackboard is the key multiplier here, but it requires all cards in hand to be Spades or Clubs. I need to make the Jack of Hearts go away. The current order is fine.\n\n**Hand Analysis and Blind Consideration**\n\nMy hand is AS, AS, KS, QS, 10S, 5S, 3S, JH. A Flush will be the play. The Flush is at Level 17 (36 mult, 275 chips), so a simple calculation puts me well over the target if Blackboard triggers. The \"Forces 1 card to always be selected\" boss effect might actually *help* me by forcing the Jack of Hearts to be selected. Playing the JH removes it from my hand, triggering Blackboard.\n\n**Consumable Consideration**\n\nI have a Justice card (Glass card) which enhances a card to a glass card. If I use it on an Ace, the Flush mult goes up to 72 * 2 (144 mult) then with Jokers it's about 80000. It's safe, but overkill. Plus, since it's a Blind, I *can* use it here, but I cannot see the cards that are selected. It's a risk! I'll hold off for now.\n\n**Command Selection and JSON Construction**\n\nThe available commands are `play_round`, `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, and `sell_joker`. I need to progress, so `play_round` is the only sensible option. The schema allows for `positions`, `intended_hand_type`, and `estimated_chips` fields. I will go with `{\"action\": \"play_round\"}` to start the round and see what the boss selects. I'm leaving `intended_hand_type` and `estimated_chips` out because I'm in the Blind Select phase.\n\n**Double-Checking and Final Decisions**\n\nI re-examined the options. The Joker order is already optimized (Odd Todd before xMult Jokers). I double-checked the Boss's description and, based on previous actions, the Wheel of Fortune from the previous turn probably did not succeed (no editions). I still have Justice, which could be useful later. I will not rearrange Jokers. My action will be `play_round`.\n\n**Final JSON Output**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"play_round\"}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
