{"reasoning":"**Analysis of Current Hand and Shop**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4, Round 10. Let's see, $5 in the bank. I've got a decent setup with Odd Todd giving me some chip boosts for odd cards, Swashbuckler adding to the multiplier, Blackboard offering a hefty x3 multiplier if I keep all spades/clubs in my hand and Joker Stencil acting as a x2 multiplier since I have one open joker slot. I used my Jupiter consumable, so nothing else there. I have 4 of 5 max jokers slots filled.\n\nI'm looking at the shop, and the Blue Joker is tempting with its +2 chip boost per card in the deck, but it costs $5. Then there's Seed Money, but I can't afford that. Reroll is also $5, and is a no-go.\n\nLet's break down this Blue Joker decision. Buying it would fill my last slot, which means Joker Stencil will only provide a x1 multiplier, since there wouldn't be any empty slots to count, including itself. Right now, Stencil is a x2 because there's one empty slot – the one that the Blue Joker would occupy.\n\nIf I *don't* buy the Blue Joker, I'm looking at potential scores around 22,680-48,600, give or take. The current hand, a Flush at level 8, is base 140 chips and 18 multiplier. The multipliers are (18 + 9) * 2 * 3.\n\nIf I *do* buy the Blue Joker, I'd get the +104 chips, pushing it to roughly 244 total. But the multiplier would drop to (18 + 9) * 1 * 3, which is 81. With that, I'm looking at around 19,764. The extra chips don't make up for the massive multiplier loss, especially with Blackboard's x3 bonus.\n\nI only have $5, so a reroll is out of the question. Nothing in the shop right now helps me. It is time to go to the next round. But wait, before I advance, let's just make sure my Jokers are in the ideal order.\n\nRight now, it's Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. The ideal scoring order goes like this: Base Hand, Played Cards, then Jokers from left to right. Swashbuckler's additive bonus comes before the multiplicative bonuses of Blackboard and Stencil. That means the Jokers have to be ordered by (1) Additive and (2) Multiplicative, making sure I am getting the highest value from the x3 mult, and x2 mult. The current arrangement seems optimal.\n\nI'm going to proceed to the next round. No need to check for any consumables or vouchers, and my money is still $5. I should not buy and sell Blue Joker because the sell values: 2+3+4+2 = 11, which turns Swashbuckler into an 11-mult joker. Is +2 Mult better than X2 Mult? No.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
