{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 8, Round 21, just cleared the Small Blind. I have a measly $2 in my wallet, so the shop options are very limited.\n\nMy current Joker lineup is Odd Todd, Blackboard, Joker Stencil, and Constellation. Odd Todd is adding chips for odd cards, Blackboard offers x3 Mult for Spades/Clubs, Stencil is at x2, and Constellation is at x1 (but needs planets). My primary strategy revolves around a Flush at level 17, offering 275 chips and a base multiplier of 36. That, coupled with my Blackboard multiplier, and the Stencil, should allow me to clear the ante.\n\nRegarding consumables, I have both Justice and Death, but I can't use them *here* because it's the SHOP phase. I'm not in a hand selection step. I can't target cards because, in this step, I don't have a visible hand. \n\nI can't afford anything in the shop. The Hanged Man is $3, the Jumbo Standard Pack is $6, and the Crystal Ball is $10. Rerolling the shop also costs $5, which is out of my budget.\n\nSince I have no actionable items in the shop, the clear next step is `round_select` to advance to the next phase, likely the Big Blind where I'll need to make some hands.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
