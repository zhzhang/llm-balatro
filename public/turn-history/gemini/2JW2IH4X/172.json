{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Selection - Initial Choice**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` (Mega Celestial Pack) phase, Ante 8, Round 19. The objective is clear: select two planet cards from these five options. I have the Telescope Voucher advantage, ensuring that Jupiter, the planet associated with my heavily played Flush hand (Level 16), is present. The Mega Pack allows me to choose two, so let's think this through.\n\nI have $14, a few Jokers (Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and two Joker Stencils). My most played hand is a Flush, and the obvious first choice has to be Jupiter. With a Flush-focused strategy, I need to choose Jupiter first.\n\nHere are the options:\n1.  Jupiter (Flush +2 Mult, +15 Chips)\n2.  Mercury (Pair)\n3.  Neptune (Straight Flush)\n4.  Venus (Three of a Kind)\n5.  Pluto (High Card).\n\nSince the schema requires selection one at a time, I should pick Jupiter, as it directly supports my primary strategy. Therefore, my action will be `select` with the position `[1]`.\n\nThe JSON I will submit is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nNext, I need to consider my second selection. For now, let's select Jupiter.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
