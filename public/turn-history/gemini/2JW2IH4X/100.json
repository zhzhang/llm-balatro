{"reasoning":"**Making a Second Pick in the Mega Celestial Pack**\n\nOkay, so I'm in this `PLANET_PACK`, the Mega Celestial Pack, after skipping the Small Blind. I've already nabbed Jupiter, which advanced me to Level 9 Flush – my primary strategy here. Now I need to pick a second card. The options are Uranus (Two Pair, Level 2), Saturn (Straight, Level 1), Earth (Full House, Level 1), and Mercury (Pair, Level 1).\n\nMy entire focus is on Flushes. None of these really *help* the Flush strategy directly, but this is a Mega Pack, so I get two cards. Since it costs me nothing, I have to pick one.\n\nLooking at the fallback options, I'm thinking about those pesky boss effects, like \"The Pillar\" or \"The Eye\" that could derail my Flush plans. Two Pair seems like my most likely alternative if I can't hit a Flush. I have five joker slots and am using four. My Jokers are Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. Odd Todd gives chips for odd ranks, Swashbuckler provides mult based on sell values, Blackboard gives X3 mult if the hand is Spades/Clubs, and Joker Stencil gives X2 for the empty slot.\n\nOkay, let's look at the remaining cards again. Uranus gives +1 Mult and +20 chips for Two Pair, Saturn gives +3 Mult and +30 chips for Straight, Earth gives +2 Mult and +25 chips for Full House, and Mercury gives +1 Mult and +15 chips for Pair.\n\nGiven that I'm playing a Flush deck, Two Pair or Full House are my most likely fallbacks. Actually, straight is also possible. Two Pair is the most likely, since it's Level 2. Straight is tempting for the +3 mult.\n\nThinking about it more, if I can't get a Flush, I might end up with High Card, Pair, or Two Pair. I’ve already got two pair in the bank if needed.\n\nIt's essentially filler at this point, but I'll go with Uranus. It was already mentioned earlier as a potential fallback.\n\nWait a second… the prompt says to select them one at a time. The last action was selecting Jupiter. Now I'm being prompted to pick from the remaining cards: Uranus, Saturn, Earth, or Mercury. I'll select Uranus (1).\n\nSo, my action is `select` and the position is `[1]` (Uranus).\n\nHmm, before I confirm that, should I rearrange my Jokers? No, my current order is fine: Chips -> +Mult -> XMult -> XMult. It's the optimal sequence.\n\nAlright, I'm selecting Uranus (position 1). Let's do it.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
