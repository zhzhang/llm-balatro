{"reasoning":"**Strategic Joker Selection for Optimal Multiplier Scaling**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's round three, and I'm looking at the BUFFOON_PACK, deciding on my next Joker. My hand currently features the *Odd Todd* Joker, giving +31 chips for odd-ranked cards, and the *Blackboard* Joker, which triples the multiplier if all cards held are Spades or Clubs. I'm sitting on $5, which is a bit tight, but manageable.\n\nThe pack offers two choices: the *Business Card* and a simple *Joker* that provides +4 to the multiplier. The *Blackboard* is my core multiplier, so *any* flat mult boost is vital. *Odd Todd* is my chip generator, and I'm currently leaning towards building flushes, which are level 2. Business Card would provide $2 for face cards played. The synergy of Odd Todd with Business card is negative in terms of points from the same cards being played.\n\nThe *Business Card* is intriguing for its potential to boost my economy. However, my strategy centers on leveraging *Blackboard* with Spades/Clubs and using *Odd Todd*. The face cards that trigger the Business Card (J, Q, K) are not odd cards that trigger Odd Todd, so the cards are somewhat anti-synergistic.\n\nThe Joker (+4 Mult) seems weak on its own, but it's guaranteed. It's going to make *Blackboard* more effective. Right now, if I have a base mult of 6 and add the Joker for a base of 10. The Blackboard then triples that to 30. Without the Joker, the mult would be 18. This +12 mult is very significant early on.\n\nIf I'm fishing for flushes of Clubs/Spades, face cards come up. However, building an early economy is strong. While Business Card provides $0-10 per round, I need to focus on winning. I'm currently in a \"money hole\". The standard Joker is one of the weakest jokers, but it provides something,\n\nWith the *Blackboard* and *Odd Todd* in play, I desperately need flat mult to scale effectively. The 6 base mult is low. Adding the +4 makes a total mult of 10. Then 10 * 3 = 30. The difference is +12 mult. Given I have *Blackboard*, I need to ensure that I can beat the scaling blinds.\n\nI'm thinking about the Business Card again. I have flushes.\n\nSince I already have *Blackboard* and *Odd Todd*, flat mult is Priority #1 to scale. I need to make the Blackboard work. This basic Joker is a guaranteed boost. The meta has shown that +4 mult is better than nothing, but is it better than Business Card?\n\nMy core logic is: *Blackboard* X3 is very strong. Base mult is 6. The flush score is (Base Chips + Card Chips + Odd Todd Chips) * (Base Mult + Joker Mult) * Blackboard. With the Joker it is (Chips) * (6 + 4) * 3 = Chips * 30. Without Joker: (Chips) * (6) * 3 = Chips * 18. That's a 66% increase in total score. So, *Business Card* requires playing face cards.\n\nI'll take the Joker to solidify the win condition.\n\nThe pack card position of the Joker is 2. The final command is: `select 2`.\n\nAction: \"select\", Positions: [2].\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
