{"reasoning":"**The Optimal Shop Phase**\n\nAlright, let's break down this shop phase. Ante 6, Flush is my focus with Spades and Clubs for Blackboard's x3 Mult. I've got $9. Jupiter, which levels up Flush, is my immediate play.\n\nFirst, use that Jupiter. It's a free, immediately beneficial action. I don't need to overthink it; using the consumable is the priority. The schema wants the `use_consumable` action and the position, which is `[1]`. So, the command is `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\n\nNext up, a Celestial Pack. Telescope guarantees Jupiter, and it's a no-brainer to get more Flush scaling. That's a solid $4 well spent. Then, given the emphasis on Blackjack, let's get that Arcana Pack for another $4 to help optimize the deck, stripping away those pesky Hearts and Diamonds.\n\nI'm leaving myself with $1, losing out on interest, but scaling matters more at this point in the game.\n\nSo, the optimal order is:\n\n1.  Use Jupiter from inventory: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\n2.  Buy Celestial Pack.\n3.  Buy Arcana Pack.\n\nThe goal is to maximize Flush strength and deck consistency, and these actions directly support that strategy.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
