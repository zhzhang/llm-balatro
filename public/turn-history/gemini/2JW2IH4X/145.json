{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Round 15 - Blind Selection**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 7/8, Round 15, and I'm in the BLIND_SELECT phase. My current blind is 35,000 chips – a Small Blind, and I have zero dollars. Let's see, my Jokers are Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I'm holding a strong hand that should deliver a level 14 Flush, which gives 230 chips and a 30x multiplier as a baseline. The 'Economy Tag' is useless with no money. It doubles zero, which is still zero. So, skipping is a non-option.\n\nPlaying is the only sensible choice.  Beating the blind nets me at least the $3 base reward, plus likely another few dollars from remaining hands and interest.  Let's do a quick calculation. Playing a Flush with just the base and Jokers: the Flush gives 230 chips. Odd Todd can add significant value if I draw enough odd cards; say 155 chips if I get a full set of odd cards. Then there's the x3 multiplier from Blackboard if I get a Spades/Clubs hand, and a x2 from Joker Stencil, plus a +9 from the Swashbuckler. Minimum value: 230 chips * 39 mult * 6 = 53,820 chips. I easily clear the 35,000 chip requirement in a single hand.\n\nSo, the play is clear.  Playing gets me some money, which is what I need for the next ante. I should be able to land somewhere around 55,000-100,000 chips depending on draws. For safety, I will stick with the lowest estimate, roughly 54k.\n\nI need money, so skipping is pointless. I'm going to play the round, aiming for a flush. Based on the previous turn history, the command is `play_round`. So, the final plan is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 53820\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
