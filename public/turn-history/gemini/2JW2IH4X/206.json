{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State: A Path to Victory**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. We're at Ante 8/8, Round 22, with the Big Blind in play. The goal is to reach 75,000 chips. Right now, I have a meager 312 chips and only two hands left. I've got 4 discards I can use. The inventory reveals some interesting Jokers: \"Odd Todd\" (potential chip booster), \"Blackboard\" (crucial multiplier for Spades/Clubs), \"Joker Stencil\" (multiplier), and \"Constellation\" (another multiplier). No consumables are available.\n\nMy current hand consists of an Ace of Spades, a Ten of Spades, a Five of Hearts, a Ten of Clubs, two Seven of Clubs, a Six of Diamonds, and a Three of Diamonds. A Flush is available for Level 17 (275 chips, 36 mult.).\n\nA past action attempted a Flush, but the game registered it as a \"Pair\" (312 chips). I saw that there were two duplicate cards in the previous hand, which likely blocked the Flush.\n\nRight now, my priority is to maximize my chip gain and use my Jokers. To make Blackboard active, I need *only* Spades and Clubs in my hand. Considering the current hand, the best strategy is to discard the non-Spade/Club cards: the Five of Hearts, Six of Diamonds, and Three of Diamonds (indices 3, 7, and 8). I'll draw three new cards after that discard.\n\nWith the current Jokers: Odd Todd (+31 for Odd cards), Stencil (x2), Blackboard (x3, if S/C only), and Constellation (x1), the aim is a high-level hand, most likely a Flush. Discarding will give me the best chance.\n\nBased on the Jokers I have, I need to get the \"Blackboard\" Joker to multiply. A Flush will score around 59,400 chips *if* all the cards held are Spades or Clubs.\n\nI could also get some points from the pair of 7s in hand (but this would be too low).\n\nI've checked the discard positions to ensure the non-Spades and non-Clubs cards are discarded and the index mapping is correct.\n\nAfter reviewing the available actions and jokers, it's clear: `discard` is the best action. The positions to discard are indices 3, 7, and 8 (5 of Hearts, 6 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds). No intended hand type or estimated chips are available at the moment.\n\nSo, the action is `discard`, positions [3, 7, 8]. This will give me a new set of cards and a chance for the optimal hand.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,7,8]"}
