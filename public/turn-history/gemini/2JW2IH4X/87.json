{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Ante 4, Round 10 - Beat the Boss!**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Goal: 10,000 chips with a single hand type. We're in a SPECTRAL_PACK phase, so I've got two interesting choices. My hand: Jack(S), 2(S), 9(H), 6(H), Q(C), 4(C), Q(D), 6(D). Jokers: Odd Todd (additive, solid), Swashbuckler (multiplier, good), Blackboard (crucial for Spades/Clubs), and Joker Stencil (more multiplier). $5 in the bank.\n\nThe first option, *Familiar*, tempts me with three new enhanced face cards. But it's risky. It could help, with those face cards being Spades/Clubs, but it could also screw me, and break my Blackboard synergy, or give cards that hurt my long-term Flush strategy. Plus, with the Blackboard joker, I'm playing for a Flush only.\n\n*Aura* is more appealing. I can permanently enhance a card. Polychrome (x1.5 Mult) would be ideal, Holographic (+10 Mult) is good, Foil (+50 chips) is decent. Considering my Flush focus (Level 8: 140 chips, 18 Mult), a permanent buff is *always* a good choice.\n\nLooking at my hand, the Jack of Spades is the obvious target. It's a Spade (Blackboard synergy) and a face card that can later trigger other Jokers.\n\nSo, *Aura* it is. I need to make the command: `select 2 1` (Aura, target the Jack of Spades). No need to rearrange jokers – the multiplicative Jokers are fine in any order, and the additive is where it needs to be. I won't sell anything; I have no options.\n\nAction: `select`, Positions: `[2, 1]`. That's it, let's hope for Polychrome!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1]"}
