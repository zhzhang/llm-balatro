{"reasoning":"**My Initial Shop Assessment**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 1, Round 1, small blind completed. I'm starting with $9. The immediate goal is clear: build a strong score-generating engine early, and the best way to do that is through Jokers. Jokers are the most impactful scaling mechanism, so they're my top priority. After Jokers, it's money/economy, then hand levels/Planets, then vouchers.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Hierophant Tarot card is interesting at $3, but I can't use it yet anyway, since it requires cards in hand and I don't have any, and it's a \"Shop Card\", which means I buy and then use. Drunkard gives an extra discard, which is okay, but not ideal right now. It's a \"Shop Card\" as well. I'm focusing on \"Shop Boosters\" at the moment.\n\nThe *Buffoon Pack* for $4 immediately stands out as the strongest play. It contains two Jokers, which means a chance to build the scoring engine I want. The *Celestial Pack* offers a Planet, but Jokers are generally better this early. Re-roll is too expensive at $5.\n\nSo, I'm buying the Buffoon Pack. It'll cost $4, leaving me with $5. Since interest is calculated at the end of the round, and I've just finished the small blind, I don't need to worry about the interest yet.\n\nI'm double-checking the shop structure. The \"Shop Boosters\" are what I need to target.\n\n*   Shop Cards: Hierophant and Drunkard.\n*   Shop Boosters: Buffoon Pack and Celestial Pack.\n\nYes, buying the Buffoon Pack makes the most sense.\n\nMy final action: I'm buying the Buffoon Pack. The position is `1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
