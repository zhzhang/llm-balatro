{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis - Limited Options**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 1/8, Round 2. Shop phase. I've got a single dollar. Not exactly a king's ransom. I'm holding Odd Todd and Blackboard Jokers, and my Flush is currently Level 2. The shop has some interesting items, but they're all priced out of my reach: Ancient Joker ($8), Celestial Pack ($4), and that Grabber Voucher ($10). Even a reroll would cost me $5.\n\nLet's break this down. Selling Jokers is an option, but not a good one. Odd Todd is worth $2, Blackboard $3. Selling one or both wouldn't get me enough cash to buy anything worthwhile - maximum $4. BlackBoard is much more valuable as it will multiply my score if it's the correct suit. Rearranging my Jokers doesn't help at this stage; they trigger in the correct order as they are. Odd Todd for chips, and Blackboard for potential xMult based on the \"held in hand\" card suit check.\n\nSince I can't afford anything in the shop and selling Jokers would be a short-sighted move, there's only one logical action here: move on to the next round. I'll take the `round_select` command, and head straight to the Blind Select screen for the Ante 1 boss.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
