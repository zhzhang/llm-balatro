{"reasoning":"**Analysis Paralysis, But With a Plan**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 8, and the big blind's breathing down my neck. Time to make a move. Right now, I have $5, and a pack of tarot cards. My current hand is a good foundation, but it’s got some room for improvement to capitalize on my Jokers. I need to make a play that guarantees the highest score.\n\nMy Jokers are: Odd Todd (good for odd ranks), Blackboard (huge multiplier if I hold Spades/Clubs), Joker Stencil (scaling mult, currently at X2, needs an empty slot for scaling), and Constellation (X1 right now). My inventory includes Justice. I have a deck with Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, and Hearts. I have a flush, and Blackboard is my priority.\n\nMy hand needs fixing. My options are: The Wheel of Fortune (gamble for a powerful upgrade on a Joker), The Lovers (make a card Wild), or Judgement (random Joker).\n\nThe best play is to pick The Lovers to make the Ace of Hearts (4) card Wild, which helps to activate *Blackboard*. It might be better to create a full Flush, using the Jack of Diamonds and 4 Spades/Clubs. The Lovers gives me the card I need to make Blackboard consistently trigger.\n\nHere’s the breakdown. The *Blackboard* multiplier is my top priority. I want to build a Flush (Spades) to trigger *Blackboard*. Making *Ace of Hearts* a Wild card, fixes the only non-Spades/Clubs in my hand, leaving me with a viable flush if I keep the card in my hand to benefit from Blackboard. \n\nEven if the new Joker is excellent, it's a gamble. It could make the *Stencil* Joker worse. If I can get a strong Joker (maybe!), the *Stencil* mult will lose value and potentially weaken my score. \n\nOkay, The Lovers it is. I'm choosing The Lovers, targeting the Ace of Hearts (4). This gives me the card I need, consistently.\n\nDecision: I need to re-evaluate the target. What about the Jack of Diamonds? No, the Ace of Hearts is Odd (it benefits Todd), so I'm more likely to want to play the card. The Lovers is the smarter play: it gives me a higher chance to win.\n\n**Final decision is `select 2 4`**. Ready. Let's make this work.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,4]"}
