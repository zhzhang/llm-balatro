{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 2/8, Round 5, post-Big Blind, and I have $16. The immediate goal is to prepare for \"The Window\" Boss Blind, which debuffs Diamond cards, and I need to hit 1600 score. My current Jokers are Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd cards), a generic Joker (+4 Mult), and Blackboard (x3 Mult for all Spades/Clubs in hand). My hand levels are Flush Level 2 (50x6) and Two Pair Level 2 (40x3).\n\nThe shop offers a few things to consider: \"To Do List\" (Full House $4 earn), Greedy Joker (+3 Mult for Diamonds - a complete *no* given the upcoming debuff), a Buffoon Pack ($4, potential Joker swap), a Celestial Pack ($4, planets), Overstock ($10, extra card slot), and a $5 Reroll. With interest capped at $25, and currently earning $3 interest, every dollar counts.\n\nBlackboard's x3 multiplier for Spades/Clubs is the key right now, so I need to prioritize Jokers that support this. Buying the Buffoon Pack seems like the best immediate move. This is a chance to replace the +4 Mult Joker or fill an empty Joker slot. It's a high-value purchase. After that, I can decide between the Celestial Pack for hand upgrades, or the long-term Overstock investment.\n\nI'm starting with `buy_booster 1` to get the Buffoon Pack. The value for the Buffoon Pack is high, for the potential to gain a better joker, or to free up a spot. I will need to buy the Buffoon Pack first, then think about which cards to buy with the remaining $12.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
