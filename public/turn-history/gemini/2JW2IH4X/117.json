{"reasoning":"**Here's the plan I've meticulously crafted to maximize my score in this round.**\n\nOkay, the situation is this: Round 13, small blind, and I need 20,000 chips.  I've got a decent hand, but I'm starting from zero, so I need to make some strategic moves. I've got four hands and no discards. Here's my hand: I'm holding a Queen, Jack, 10, 8, and 6 of Spades, a Jack of Hearts (the problem!), an Ace of Clubs (Blue Seal!), and a 7 of Clubs. My Jokers are: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil.\n\nMy initial thought is the obvious one: the Spade Flush.  Level 10 Flush, base of 170 chips, 22 mult. If I just went with the flush, I'd score 16,368. Not enough to win in one hand. The critical issue is the Jack of Hearts. Blackboard multiplies the score by 3 IF all *held* cards are Spades or Clubs. The Jack of Hearts breaks the Blackboard trigger. If I play the Flush as is, the Blackboard would not trigger.\n\nSo, the key is getting rid of the Jack of Hearts. I could just play it as a High Card. I have 4 hands, so I can \"fish\" for a clean hand by playing single non-spade/non-club cards. The Ace of Clubs (Blue Seal) is my safety net. The plan is to get the Blue Seal to trigger.\n\nIf I play the Jack of Hearts as a High Card (25 + 10 chips base). Swashbuckler gives +9 mult. Joker Stencil will give *x2* since I have four Jokers, and one empty slot. But since all the cards I *hold* will be Spades/Clubs, Blackboard triggers (x3). That's 35 chips times 72 mult = 2,520 chips.\n\nThe odds of a \"bad\" card coming up (Hearts or Diamonds) are about 35%. I can play the Jack of Hearts (and hope) to draw a good card (Spade or Club) that I can then use to trigger a Spade Flush with Blackboard.\n\nSo, I'm now set.\n\nThe action is simple: Play the Jack of Hearts.\n\nI checked a few details:\n\n*   Odd Todd: The Jack is not an odd card, so it doesn't give any bonus.\n*   Blackboard triggers on held cards, not played.\n\n*   Stencil: *x2* correct.\n*   7 of Clubs: No reason to discard a good card.\n\nIf I draw a Spade or Club, I'll then play the Spade Flush, with Blackboard triggering. If I get the flush, my final score will be 49,104. So I can win.\n\nThe Jack of Spades is a Foil card, it triggers when *scored*, not *played*, so in the High Card hand, the Jack of Spades will not add any chips.\n\nI need to make sure the Flush is the *last* hand I play, since it contains the Blue Seal.\n\nI've got it. Let's do this:\n\nI'm playing the Jack of Hearts, the type of hand is High Card, and my estimated score is 2520 chips. Let's go!\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [6],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"high card\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 2520\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [6]"}
