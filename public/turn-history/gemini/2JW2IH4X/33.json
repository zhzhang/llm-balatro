{"reasoning":"**Strategic Joker Optimization: Seizing the Multiplier Advantage**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2/8, Round 5, with \"The Window\" boss blind looming. Diamonds are debuffed, so I'm already thinking about my hand composition. I've got $12 to play with, and I've just opened the `BUFFOON_PACK`.\n\nMy current Jokers are: Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd cards), a basic Joker (+4 Mult), and Blackboard (x3 Mult if all hand cards are Spades or Clubs). I have two hand levels I'm working with, Flush Lvl 2 (50x6) and Two Pair Lvl 2 (40x3).\n\nThe decision before me is between Joker Stencil and Shortcut. Shortcut is interesting for building Straights with gaps, but I'm really focusing on Flushes and maximizing the Blackboard multiplier. Blackboard is my current powerhouse, but it hinges on maintaining a hand of only Spades and Clubs.\n\nMy analysis boils down to maximizing multipliers. Blackboard provides a x3 boost when conditions are met. Odd Todd's flat chip increase per odd card is helpful, but the basic Joker (+4 Mult) is easily replaceable. I need to get rid of it.\n\nIf I take Joker Stencil, I'll have 4 Jokers, leaving 1 empty slot. Stencil grants a x2 multiplier. However, if I *then* sell the basic Joker, I'll have 3 Jokers, and 2 empty slots, resulting in Stencil giving a x3 multiplier. Stencil (x3) + Blackboard (x3) is a huge x9 multiplier, and is an excellent boost for the current ante.\n\nShortcut doesn't synergize with the Blackboard strategy as well, which doesn't care about hand type but color.\n\nTherefore, my strategy is simple: I'll select Joker Stencil (in position 1 of the pack) and then sell the basic Joker. This will give me a huge multiplier. Action: `select`, positions: `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
