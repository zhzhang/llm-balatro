{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Round 7, Big Blind Incoming**\n\nOkay, let's assess the situation. I'm at Ante 3/8, round 7, and the Big Blind is up. I've only got $1, which is not enough to buy anything from the shop (Earth and The Chariot are both $3), or reroll the shop ($5). I can't buy any boosters or vouchers either. Selling a Joker is an option, but Odd Todd provides chips, the base Joker gives multiplier, Blackboard gives x3 multiplier (if Spades/Clubs), and the Joker Stencil provides x2. These are all useful, so selling is a last resort. No consumables to sell, either.\n\nThe Telescope Voucher is there, but I can't use it.\n\nGiven my money constraints, my next step is clear: move to the next blind.\n\nBefore that, I can rearrange Jokers. My current order is: Odd Todd (chips), Joker (+4 mult), Blackboard (x3 mult), and Joker Stencil (x2 mult). The scoring order is crucial: Additive mult needs to go before Multiplicative mult. In this order, the Jokers trigger left-to-right, but the order of the Multiplicatives doesn't affect the calculations, as multiplication is commutative. This appears optimized.\n\nFor the upcoming hand, I'm aiming for a Flush (Level 5). This has a base of 95 chips and 12 mult. Odd Todd can add significant chips based on played odd ranks. Assuming I play three odd-numbered cards, that's +93 chips. With average card chips (7), the total card chips is 35. Total chips could be 95 + 35 + 93 = 223.\n\nFor the mult, the base is 12 + 4 (Joker) = 16. With Blackboard, if the Flush is Spades/Clubs it gives x3, and x2 with Stencil. The math comes out to 223 * 96 ≈ 21,408 chips, but even without Blackboard's multiplier I'd be at 223 * 32 ≈ 7,136 chips. This easily clears the anticipated Big Blind requirements.\n\nThe only reasonable action is `round_select`.\n\nChecking my JSON again to follow the schema.\n\nThe action is `round_select`, and I'm good to go.\n\nFinal JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
