{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action for Balatro Round**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4, Round 10 of Balatro, facing a Boss Blind - The Eye, which means I *must* play only one hand type this round. The current chip requirement is 10,000, and I have $5 to work with.\n\nMy build is heavily focused on Flushes, and they're at Level 8, which is ideal, and my Joker setup is as follows: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. I've already optimized the Joker order: Odd Todd adds chips, Swashbuckler is additive Mult, and Blackboard & Stencil are multiplicative, and I already account for the standard scoring method.\n\nI'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase after skipping the Big Blind, so the only viable action is to play the round. My primary strategy aligns *perfectly* with the Boss Blind's restriction, it's pretty much a free pass. My Jokers are ideal here because they're all contributing to a flush build.\n\nTo get a sense of where I'm at, I will do a quick chip calculation. Assuming a Flush with at least some odd-ranked cards, I can pull off a Flush with all Spades or Clubs to trigger Blackboard, making the calculation: 140 (base chips) + (sum of card ranks) + (chips from Odd Todd) * (base Mult + Swashbuckler) * Blackboard * Joker Stencil. Let's imagine I play A(S), 9(S), 7(S), 5(S), 3(S) for this: that would result in (330 Chips) * 162 Mult = 53,460 total, well over the requirement. Even if I don't trigger Blackboard and play a flush with at least one red card, the value is still significantly above what I require, at 17,820.\n\nTherefore, the action I'm going to take is to `play_round`. I am certain of this, and am ready to provide the JSON output. I'm ready to advance!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
