{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Facing the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here we are, at the Boss Blind of Ante 1 in Balatro. I'm in `BLIND_SELECT` right now, staring down a 600-chip requirement. This Boss is a nasty one, randomly discarding two cards per hand. I'm at Ante 1/8, Round 2, with a measly $1 in my pocket. Let's see what I'm working with...\n\nMy Jokers are Odd Todd and Blackboard. Odd Todd's giving me +31 Chips for odd-rank cards scored – that's potentially very useful. Blackboard is the real kicker: a juicy X3 Mult if all the cards I hold are Spades or Clubs. My hand is currently at Flush Level 2 (50 Chips, 6 Mult) and my last two hands were a Flush and a High Card. Not too shabby, but not quite a sure thing yet.\n\nNow, my initial thought was to rearrange the Jokers, but after considering order of operations, that doesn't matter since Odd Todd's additive and Blackboard is independent. The important thing is that Blackboard checks hand state at the end. That means I need to prioritize Spades and Clubs if I want to maximize my Blackboard multiplier.\n\nLet's break it down: The goal is 600 chips. A Flush will be my bread and butter, especially with Odd Todd's bonus. The strategy is clear: I *have* to go for Spades or Clubs flushes. I need to discard Hearts and Diamonds ASAP. I've got no consumables to use or sell and selling a Joker is out of the question.\n\nThe only move that makes any sense is to start the round and see what the cards bring. Let's get to it!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
