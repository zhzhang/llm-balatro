{"reasoning":"**Shopping Spree Strategy for Ante 7**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase of Round 16, with a small blind complete, and I have $6. My immediate goal is to maximize my score in this round and prepare for the Big and Boss Blinds of Ante 7. I'm running a Flush-focused build, currently at Level 14, which gives me a base of 230 chips and 30x multiplier.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid: Odd Todd boosts odd ranks (useful), Swashbuckler provides mult based on sell values, Blackboard gives a 3x multiplier if I have Spades/Clubs in hand (crucial), and Joker Stencil gives 2x mult because I have one empty slot. Altogether, my current Joker multiplier is (Base + 9) * 6. I need to keep that Stencil slot open.\n\nThe shop is offering some interesting choices, but I need to make a strategic decision. \"Splash\" looks tempting, but it doesn't really synergize with my flush strategy, especially since Odd Todd is already giving me chip boosts. \"Justice\" is also there. But since I am in the Shop and not a Round, I cannot use Justice on cards in my hand because I don't have a \"hand\" visible in the shop phase. It requires a target card, which I don't have. So it's not useful right now.\n\nNow, the \"Arcana Pack\" is where things get interesting. Two of them are available. For $4, these could be game-changers. Tarot cards can offer suit conversions, rank adjustments, or enhancements, which directly address my key concern: maintaining that Blackboard condition and/or converting cards to the Odd Todd benefit. I could also get resources. I'm leaning toward getting one.\n\nI could also reroll for $5, but with only $6, that's a gamble I'm not willing to take right now.\n\nSo, here's the breakdown: I can't afford the Crystal Ball. Splash is not good. Justice can't be used now. Reroll is risky. Therefore, buying an Arcana Pack makes the most sense. It gives me flexibility and a chance to directly improve my hand with potential suit or rank conversions. Plus, it leaves me with $2 for later rounds. And with an Arcana Pack, I get to keep Joker Stencil's x2 mult.\n\nTherefore, I will buy the first Arcana Pack, which is Booster 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
