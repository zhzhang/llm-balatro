{"reasoning":"**My Shopping Spree: A Symphony of Spades and Clubs**\n\nAlright, here's the game plan. We're in Round 10, Ante 4, with $11 in the coffers. The objective, as always, is to maximize my score and keep the economy humming. My core strategy hinges on that Flush hand, now at Level 7, which gives me a solid base. The real star of the show is the Blackboard Joker; if I can keep a hand of all Spades and Clubs, that X3 multiplier is pure gold. This means I'm laser-focused on deck management. I've got two other Jokers contributing to my score: Odd Todd, with the odd cards, and Swashbuckler, who gets a Mult based on the sell values of the other Jokers. And last up is my Joker Stencil, with is currently X2 for two open slots. I'm sitting pretty with my current hand.\n\nMy initial thought was to grab a Blue Joker, but the math doesn't lie. Even though it's a solid chip boost, it costs me a crucial Stencil multiplier. Plus, the immediate score impact is negative. No dice. Then, I considered the Seed Money Voucher. While having $10 would be useful, it's a long-term play, and right now, I need immediate deck fixing or boosts. I can save it for later. Rerolling the shop for a better Joker is tempting, but a bit of a gamble.\n\nThat leaves the Jumbo Arcana Pack, and it's looking increasingly attractive. For $6, I can manipulate the deck and get some Spades and Clubs with the packs, or gain some additional money. The potential for the World or the Moon is a game changer for Blackboard consistency. And the Hermit or Temperance would be a boon to the economy. The current math points toward the pack.\n\nWith the Jumbo Arcana Pack, I can bring up my hand consistency, and still get $1 interest next round. The key here is mitigating the risk of drawing the wrong suits and torpedoing my Blackboard multiplier. If all goes as planned, I should continue to score quite high, and the arcana pack gives the deck fix needed to make this happen. I will have $5 left after the purchase. This is the optimal move. \n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
