{"reasoning":"**My Analytical Breakdown: Choosing the Optimal Spectral Pack Card**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 11, skipping the Big Blind, with $6 left. I'm holding a Spectral Pack with a critical decision to make. My goal is to build a deck that can reliably beat the upcoming 44,000-chip boss, and my strategy centers around Flushes, especially because I have a level 9 Flush. I'm leaning heavily on my Jokers: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil.\n\nLet's break down the choices. I have two options: Cryptid, which duplicates a card in my hand, and Ankh, which duplicates a Joker but destroys the others.\n\nAnkh is immediately risky. While duplicating Blackboard or Stencil could be powerful, the cost of potentially losing all my other jokers – like Swashbuckler's flat multiplier and Odd Todd's chip generation – is too high, especially right before a boss fight. It's a gamble I can't afford right now.\n\nCryptid, on the other hand, provides a safe and strategic opportunity. I have to figure out what is the best use for this pack. My hand consists of: Ace of Spades, Queen of Spades, 6 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, King of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds. To be blunt, the odd cards are what I care about now because of Odd Todd. The 5 and Ace of Spades and 5 of Clubs, are good targets for Odd Todd. But more broadly, I'm focusing on getting more Spades and Clubs so I can reliably trigger Blackboard.\n\nBlackboard is my primary X-multiplier. To trigger it, I *must* have only Spades or Clubs in my hand at the end of the scoring phase. So, by getting more Spades, I can keep those and discard the off-suit cards.\n\nTherefore, the best play is to select Cryptid and duplicate the Ace of Spades. This will increase the likelihood of getting Flushes.\n\nI've confirmed the position. I'm choosing Cryptid from position 1 and targeting the Ace of Spades, also in position 1 of my hand. The command will be `select 1 1`.\n\nEven more important: Is there any reason NOT to use Cryptid? No. Is there a reason to use Ankh? Absolutely not. I've double-checked my Jokers; their current order (Todd, Swash, Blackboard, Stencil) is optimal. I checked my available money ($6). There is a shop after the Big Blind skip; the next stop is the Boss.\n\nFinally, let me double-check my math. Playing a Flush of 5 odd cards with my Jokers: (155 + 5*31) * (20 + 9) * 3 * 2 = 310 * 29 * 6 = 53,940. This exceeds the boss's HP. More Aces will lead to more consistency.\n\nTherefore, I am selecting Cryptid on the Ace of Spades.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1]"}
