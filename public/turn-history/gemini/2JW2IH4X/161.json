{"reasoning":"**The Blackboard Flush Conundrum**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante is at 7/8 in round 18, and I'm facing the Boss, The Psychic. I need 70,000 chips, and I'm starting with a measly $5. This hand looks promising, or at least it *could* be. I've got a starting hand of 10 of Spades (Steel, x1.5 Multi), two 8 of Spades, a 7 of Spades, a 3 of Spades, an Ace of Hearts, a Queen of Diamonds, and a 7 of Diamonds. I also have four Jokers: Odd Todd, Swashbuckler, Blackboard, and Joker Stencil. Currently, my best hand is a Flush Level 16, which is a solid 34 Multi.\n\nThe Boss wants 5 cards. No problem. But then there's Blackboard; that Joker's potentially a game-changer with its x3 Multi, *if* all cards I *hold* in my hand after the play are Spades or Clubs. I'm also thinking about Odd Todd since I have a 7 and a 3 of Spades.\n\nMy immediate challenge is those pesky Hearts and Diamonds (AH, QD, 7D). If I just play the flush (10S, 8S, 8S, 7S, 3S), the remaining cards in hand, (AH, QD, 7D), screw Blackboard. The 10 of Spades (Steel) is only x1.5, which is nothing compared to x3. So, I need to ditch them, those Hearts and Diamonds, to trigger Blackboard. I have 4 discards, so this is feasible.\n\nI could discard the AH, QD, and 7D to get only Spades left. I can then rely on the draw to hopefully give me some Spades and/or Clubs.\n\nNow the question is: what to discard? It's a no-brainer: discard the AH, QD, and 7D. I need to make sure I have only Spades or Clubs left so that I can utilize the x3 Blackboard Joker.\n\nSo, I will take the action to `discard` positions 6 (Ace of Hearts), 7 (Queen of Diamonds), and 8 (7 of Diamonds). I'm hoping for some favorable draws. Let's do it.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [6,7,8]"}
