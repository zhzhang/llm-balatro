{"reasoning":"**Current Play Analysis & Decision-Making**\n\nOkay, here we are, Round 21, and I'm about to move to the Big Blind with $84 in the pot. This is PLANET_PACK, or Celestial Pack, and the strategy is clear: I'm all about Flushes. My Joker lineup is interesting. I've got Zany (neg), Bootstraps (uncommon), Four Fingers (uncommon), To the Moon (neg), Seltzer (uncommon), Vampire (uncommon), Baseball Card (rare), and Hallucination (neg). Baseball Card is the key; it multiplies my score for each Uncommon Joker, and I've got five: Bootstraps, Four Fingers, Seltzer, Vampire and also To the Moon.\n\nMy hand levels are relevant; Flush is already at Level 5. The pack choices are Pluto (High Card), Saturn (Straight), and Jupiter (Flush). Obviously, Jupiter is the choice here. It's the only one that directly levels up my preferred hand. Jupiter will boost the Flush, and it's the right choice given my current strategy. I'm going to select Jupiter to move Flush to Level 6.\n\nLet's see, that's position 3 in the pack. So the command I need is `select 3`. And that's what I will do.\n\nBefore I commit to this selection, I need to check something quickly. Remember that Hallucination (neg) Joker? It gives me a 1 in 2 chance to get a tarot card when I open a booster. I opened the pack in the last round. My current state displays \"Owned Consumeables: None,\" so it looks like Hallucination didn't trigger. I will keep that in mind.\n\nOkay, the Flush has a base of 95 chips and 12 Mult. With the Jupiter pack I have access to, it gives me +15 chips and +2 Mult, and a new total of 110 chips and 14 Mult. This is the way. Time to take the action: `select 3`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
