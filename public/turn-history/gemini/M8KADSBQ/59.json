{"reasoning":"**My Plan: Prioritizing Long-Term Scaling Over Immediate Boss Kill**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. We're at Ante 3, moving towards the Boss Blind. I've got a healthy $25, and my Jokers are solid: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire. I've also got The Magician in my consumables, which can be useful for the boss fight. The goal is to maximize future scaling while handling the current Boss, \"The Eye\" (1 hand only), as efficiently as possible.\n\nThe \"Hieroglyph\" voucher looks incredibly tempting. It drops the Ante back to 2, essentially resetting the difficulty curve and allowing my scaling Jokers, especially Vampire and Bootstraps, to become even more potent. It's a permanent buff. The -1 hand is a slight downside, dropping me from 4 to 3 hands, but it’s manageable, especially if I can scale effectively. Plus, with \"To the Moon\", having $15 after the purchase is the \"interest floor\" for $6 (since \"To the Moon\" increases interest).\n\nBuying \"Hieroglyph\" for $10 is the immediate play here. It gives me a major advantage for the long haul. After the purchase, I'll have $15, which is still good for To the Moon/Bootstraps.\n\nThe alternative options are less attractive. The \"Lusty Joker\" might add some burst Mult if I get Hearts in hand, but the slot is more valuable for a scaling Joker. Standard Packs *might* give enhanced cards for Vampire, but that's a gamble. The \"Reroll\" isn't necessary at this stage.\n\nConsidering the fact that I just beat the Big Blind, the next round is likely to be the Boss. \"Hieroglyph\" makes \"The Eye\" easier, because the chip requirement drops significantly. Since I am already in the shop, after the big blind, I can either reset the next round or face the boss. With Ante 2, the boss becomes much easier to beat and allows time for scaling. With \"Hieroglyph\", I can easily scale the vampire. The boss would be a walk in the park.\n\nI will also keep in mind that Standard Packs are a gamble but should be skipped in favor of the Hieroglyph. \n\nSo the plan is: Buy Hieroglyph. That's the most efficient move here.\n\nOkay, let's execute. I'm going to **buy_voucher 1**. That's the correct format. Let's see how this pays off!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
