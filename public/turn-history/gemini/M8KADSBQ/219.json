{"reasoning":"**Strategic Joker Selection for Optimal Multiplier Gains**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 8, final round. My immediate goal is to maximize my score here. I've got a Mega Buffoon Pack, with a nice $86 in the bank, and an interesting set of Jokers: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination. Three are \"negative,\" meaning they don't take up a slot. So I actually have three open slots! Let me make sure I'm clear here: I currently have Bootstraps, Four Fingers, Seltzer, Vampire, and Baseball Card active, leaving 3 slots available. My money situation is stable.\n\nThe Mega Buffoon Pack offers Red Card, Egg, Banner, and Even Steven. None of these Jokers are uncommon, so they won't trigger the Baseball Card multiplier. Since all the pack options are Common, there are no synergies with my existing setup.\n\nNow, let's break down each choice: Red Card is useless unless I skip a ton, Egg has a future sell value, Banner is just chips, and Even Steven gives a little multiplier for even ranks. Since my primary goal is to maximize the final round score, I need to evaluate for immediate and future impact.\n\nI had the idea that Hallucination would trigger when I opened the pack, but it didn't, so I'll ignore that consideration.\n\nThe Baseball Card is key here. It provides a x1.5 multiplier for each Uncommon Joker. Given that I have 5 Uncommons (Bootstraps, Four Fingers, Seltzer, Vampire, and To the Moon), the total multiplier from Baseball Card is substantial. The other Jokers don't have good synergies with my current state.\n\nI can't skip the pack; I *have* to choose two. Since I have 3 open slots, I'll take Egg now, because it provides an immediate sell value of $3, which adds to the Bootstraps joker multiplier, and it increases in value each round.\n\nThe important thing is making the most of this pack.\n\nThe best strategic move is to select the Egg (position 2). I'll take the Egg for its sell value. So, \"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": \\[2].\n\nHere is my decision:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
