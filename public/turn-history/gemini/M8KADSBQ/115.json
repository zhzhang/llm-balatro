{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis and Action: Starting the Round**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Blind Select, round 11, with $32 and the \"Psychic\" Boss blind - which means I *must* play 5 cards. My goal is 10,000 chips, and I have a Flush hand that's level 2. My Jokers are looking pretty solid: Crafty Joker will add chips, Four Fingers enables 4-card Flushes (but I need 5 cards), To the Moon offers interest, Bootstraps boosts my Mult by +12, Zany Joker adds to 3-of-a-kind, and Vampire is x2.8 (with potential to be increased). I also have two consumables: The Sun (convert 3 to hearts) and Strength (rank +1 for 2 cards), but those are for after the round starts, not during Blind Select.\n\nThe core of the strategy is to aim for a Level 2 Flush, given my Four Fingers Joker. That means I must create a flush with 4 cards, then add a junk card. I need 10,000 chips. I estimate a Level 2 Flush *could* generate around 9,000 chips using my current Jokers, with potential to push it further if I get some luck on the card draw. It might not be enough in one go.\n\nI *could* try to use the \"The Sun\" and \"Strength\" cards to push my flush, but that would use the enhancement and Vampire will remove it.\n\nThe immediate next step is clear: I have to start the round to see what cards I get. The only sensible action is to proceed by running `play_round`. So I'm setting the `action` to \"play_round\", with `positions`, `intended_hand_type` and `estimated_chips` set to `null` to indicate that I'm just beginning. This is it! Let's get this round going!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
