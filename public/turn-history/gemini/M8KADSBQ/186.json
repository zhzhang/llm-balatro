{"reasoning":"**Ready to Play: Boss Blind Strategy**\n\nOkay, here we go. It's Boss Blind time, and I'm locked in. No way around it. The description \"No repeat hand types this round\" tells me I'm facing \"The Eye,\" the no-repeat blind, which means I need to win in one hand type or risk losing. I need to hit 40,000 chips, and I have $48, 6/8 ante, and round 17.\n\nMy inventory is pretty solid, though. I've got a strong Joker lineup: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, and Baseball Card. I've also got The Hanged Man consumable for deck thinning, which can come in handy. I've already optimized the Joker order in the previous phase to make sure that the +mult Jokers come before my Xmult jokers.\n\nI need to quickly assess the optimal play here. Since the Blind is \"No repeat hand types this round\", I cannot play two hands, so I will have to play one single hand.\nI need to calculate the multipliers to see what is possible.\nThe Baseball Card effect is a bit tricky, and I have to remember that it triggers for each Uncommon Joker. It adds an X1.5 trigger for each Uncommon Joker. So the order of my Uncommon Jokers isn't critical, as long as it's not between my +Mult and my XMult.\n\nHere's my current Joker order and the calculations:\n1.  **Zany** (Common, +12 Mult): This gives +12 to the hand if a Three of a Kind is played.\n2.  **Bootstraps** (Uncommon, +18 Mult): +18 to base score\n3.  **Four Fingers** (Uncommon)\n4.  **To the Moon** (Uncommon)\n5.  **Seltzer** (Uncommon)\n6.  **Vampire** (Uncommon, X3.3 Mult): Multiplies the total score by X3.3, but also triggers Baseball Card.\n7.  **Baseball Card** (Rare): Provides X1.5 Mult to all Uncommon Jokers.\n\nMy current Joker multipliers are:\n+Mult: Zany (+12) + Bootstraps (+18) = +30.\nXMult: (1.5)^5 * 3.3 = 25.059.\n\nNow, let's say I play a Flush (95 chips at Level 5). The level does not affect the chip count, but a higher level would be better.\nScore: 95 * (12 + 18) * 25.059 = 95 * 42 * 25.059 = 99,750.\nI easily exceed the chip requirements of 40,000 for this blind.\nSince I am facing \"No repeat hand types this round,\" a single hand should do it.\n\nSo, I think I have a plan! Time to play and see if my calculations are right.\n\nAction: `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
