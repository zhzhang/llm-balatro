{"reasoning":"**Final Boss Prep - Time to Reroll!**\n\nOkay, final ante, round 20. The end is nigh! I'm sitting on $79, with a solid Joker lineup: Zany for my 3-of-a-kind hands, Bootstraps (at +30, thanks to my cash), Four Fingers for flush/straight synergy, To the Moon (that interest!), Seltzer for some retriggers, Vampire (my big multiplier at X3.5, and growing), Baseball Card boosting my Uncommon jokers, and Hallucination for potential Tarot cards.\n\nMy gut says I need to maximize my Vampire multiplier or boost my Flush-focused hand. Shoot the Moon and Faceless Joker aren't going to cut it here. I'm rolling with five Uncommon jokers: Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, and Vampire. Baseball Card gives them each a 1.5x multiplier, resulting in a multiplicative boost of roughly 7.59x.\n\nThe shop is my last chance to juice things up. I'm thinking, \"Let's reroll!\" It'll cost me $6, dropping my Bootstraps from +30 to +28, a minor setback. But the payoff could be huge! I'm really hoping to find a Booster Pack because of my Hallucination Joker. That 50% chance at a Tarot card could be the game-changer for Vampire. Even a Planet or Standard pack would be useful here.\n\nI already have the Devil card, but it's not the time to play it, not until the start of the next round. Rerolling is the key.\n\nReroll number one, and nothing. I'm going to reroll again, with no pack currently.\n\nSo, the action is `reroll_shop`, the position is null, my intended hand is null, and the estimated chips are null. Time to make it happen! Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
