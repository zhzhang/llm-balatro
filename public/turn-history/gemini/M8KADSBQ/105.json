{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Priorities**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4/8, Round 11, and I'm in the SHOP phase after snagging a card from a Standard Pack. I've got $53, which is pretty healthy, and these Jokers: `Four Fingers` (my Flush/Straight enabler with 4 cards), `To the Moon` (interest), `Bootstraps` (mult), `Vampire` (mult), and `Zany Joker` (a risky +12 mult for 3-of-a-kind). I also have `The Sun` consumable and two vouchers: `Clearance Sale` and `Hieroglyph`.\n\nThe shop itself offers `Business Card` for $3 (face card chance for $2) and a `Celestial Pack` for $3, letting me pick a planet card. I can also reroll for $5.\n\nMy core strategy is clearly built around `Four Fingers` and, therefore, Flushes. I've played Flushes 17 times so far, so getting `Jupiter` from that Celestial Pack is absolutely crucial to scaling my base chips and mult on my flushes. `Business Card` is decent for some economy, but with $53 and `To the Moon`, I'm already in a good spot for interest. I get max interest at $25 (base $5) + whatever `To the Moon` gives me. Right now, at $50, I get $5 + $10 = $15. I should try to stay above $50 if possible, but that Celestial Pack is too good to pass up for only $3.\n\nMy clear choice: **I'm buying that Celestial Pack (position 1), prioritizing the chance for `Jupiter` and upgrading my flush strategy**. The alternatives (selling the `Zany Joker`, buying the `Business Card`, or rerolling) are less attractive. I'll pass on those options.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
