{"reasoning":"**Shop Dilemma: To Buy or Not to Buy**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. I'm at Ante 3/8, round 5, and staring at the shop. I've got $4, and a decent Joker setup: Four Fingers (flush/straight), To the Moon (interest), Bootstraps (mult), and Vampire (mult with enhancement scaling). I also have \"The Lovers\" consumable, which enhances a card to a Wild Card.\n\nMy main goal is to scale Vampire, and I need to start accruing money for Bootstraps and interest. I have four dollars and the shop has a Standard Pack, and Venus. I don't need Venus for my Flush playstyle. The standard pack costs $4. A Hieroglyph is $10 (out of reach), and a reroll is $5 (also out of reach).\n\nI'm thinking about the Standard Pack. Spending $4 would leave me with $0, which is bad. The pack might give me an enhanced card for Vampire, or a high-rank card to help with Flushes, but it's a gamble. It's so close to getting $5. I can't afford to get a Hieroglyph. A reroll is out of the question. I have The Lovers.\n\nThen I realize I'm *this* close to the $5 threshold for interest. If I win the next round, I'll get base rewards, hands remaining, *plus* interest. With $4, I have 0 interest. If I earn even $1, I'll have $5, which means $2 in interest ($1 base + $1 from To the Moon). But if I buy the pack, I'm starting at $0.\n\nThe question is: is a random card worth losing the chance to scale interest and Bootstraps? I think not. The Standard Pack *might* have an enhanced card for Vampire, but the safe play is to save the $4 to immediately scale interest and Bootstraps, especially because I have \"The Lovers\".\n\nI need to scale Bootstraps (additive Mult) before Vampire (multiplicative Mult). I'm in the main shop, so I can't use \"The Lovers\" right now. The only choice is to move on to the next round. I'm almost certain there is no use for Venus, or any other option in the shop.\n\nI just checked my hand levels: Flush is level 1, and I've been playing mostly Flushes. Money is still the main constraint. Saving $4 seems to be better. Also, I have \"The Lovers\" to enhance Vampire, so I'll do that during the next round.\n\nTherefore, the decision is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
