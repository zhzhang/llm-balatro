{"reasoning":"**Round Analysis: The Psychic Boss**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. Round 9, Ante 3/8. We're facing the \"Psychic\" boss, also known as **The House**, requiring 4000 chips. The trick is the first hand is drawn face down, which makes things a little annoying but not impossible to deal with.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup: Four Fingers (which is less relevant with face down hands), To the Moon (meh), Bootstraps (+16 mult), and Vampire (x2.3 mult). I've also got Hieroglyph which is nice to have in this situation, giving a -1 Ante and -1 hand.\n\nThe key is my Flush Level 2 hand (50 chips, 6 base mult), which is a good base to build on. With Bootstraps and Vampire, I'm looking at (6 + 16) * 2.3 = 50.6 mult! If I add the chips, I should be able to get at least 4000 chips with a single hand if things go well.\n\nI've got $44, so the goal is to play a single hand and get enough to beat the boss.\n\nThe current Joker order is correct: additive multiplier before multiplicative.\nI don't need to sell or rearrange anything. I'm going to play the round, no matter what cards I see.\n\nThe only valid action at this point is `play_round`. Time to see what the cards reveal!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
