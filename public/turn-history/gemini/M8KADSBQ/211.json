{"reasoning":"**Strategic Evaluation: Ante 7, Round 19 – Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 19, Shop phase, with $73 in the bank. The objective is clear: reach Ante 8 and, ultimately, win. My Joker setup is looking solid: Zany for 3-of-a-kind, Bootstraps is already at +28 Mult, Four Fingers for flushes, To the Moon giving extra interest, Seltzer for card retriggering, Vampire providing X-mult from enhancements, Baseball Card boosting Uncommon Jokers, and Hallucination for Tarot chances.\n\nI've got \"The Hermit\" consumable in inventory. My last action was using The Fool, which changed into The Hermit. Using it will double my money to $93. With that boost, Bootstraps and To the Moon will be even more effective.\n\nThe Shop has the \"Smeared Joker\", an Uncommon card that could help with flushes. However, I have Four Fingers and a full Joker board (8/8). With \"Baseball Card\" already active, I am leaning toward not replacing any of my current Jokers.\n\nTherefore, the most logical first step is to maximize the value from \"The Hermit\" by using it immediately. The command I need is `use_consumable 1`. \"The Hermit\" doesn't need targets. The Hermit is in position 1. This action directly helps the overall goal by increasing money.\n\nThe final action is: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
