{"reasoning":"**The Spectral Shuffle**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Round 5, Ante 3, with $13 in the bank. I've got a decent setup: \"Four Fingers\" for those sweet Flushes, \"To the Moon\" boosting interest, \"Bootstraps\" adding some early multi, and the star of the show, \"Vampire\". The goal is to get Vampire scaled. I'm on the hunt for enhancements to feed it.\n\nThe shop's got some interesting choices. \"The Lovers\" is a straight shot to get Vampire a Wild Card enhancement, which is perfect. \"Venus\" is tempting, but I'm primarily a Flush player. Then we have \"Standard Pack\" and the tempting \"Jumbo Spectral Pack.\" And the \"Hieroglyph\" voucher, but that feels risky, even if it resets the Ante. I'm leaning toward getting enhancements to grow Vampire and staying money-positive.\n\nSo, I need to balance scaling Vampire with keeping enough money for interest and Bootstraps. The Spectral Pack is always a gamble, but the potential upside is huge. It could change my run with a powerful spectral card. Standard packs might have enhanced cards, which are safer bets, but less exciting.\n\nI'm thinking about the money situation. A Standard Pack is cheaper, but I am in love with Vampire. If I buy the Spectral Pack ($6), I'll be left with $7. Which means $2 interest and +2 on Bootstraps. Buying The Lovers ($3) means I'd be down to $4, but I'd have a safe enhance ready for Vampire.\n\nBut the \"Jumbo\" Spectral Pack is four cards! That's too good to pass. I keep wanting to find a safe way to play, like getting The Lovers. But, let's roll the dice! I'll buy it for the potential to make this run incredible. If it's a disaster I will know I should have grabbed The Lovers.\n\n**Action: `buy_booster`**\n**Position: [2] (Jumbo Spectral Pack)**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
