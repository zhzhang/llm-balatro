{"reasoning":"**Current Evaluation of Ante 3, Round 7: Prioritizing Vampire and Interest**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, Round 7, and the SHOP is open. I've got $18, which is a decent starting point. My Jokers are Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire. Vampire is the key here; I need to feed it enhanced cards. Bootstraps is nice, scaling off my money, and To the Moon benefits from maintaining interest. I have no booster packs left.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n*   **Pluto ($3):** Doesn't really help my strategy. High Card level up is a side show here, not the main event of Flushes/Straights.\n*   **Misprint ($4):** Random mult is tempting, but doesn't feed Vampire, and takes a slot.\n*   **Director's Cut ($10):** Too expensive right now. It destroys my interest and Bootstraps.\n*   **Reroll ($5):** The hope is Tarot packs or enhanced cards, but it's a gamble.\n*   **Round Select:** This is the most efficient play.\n\nThe thing is, I already picked up a Gold 2 and three enhanced face cards in the previous round from the Familiar. I have the resources to use immediately. I'm sitting at a healthy $18, which maximizes the To the Moon and base interest to a total of $6. Pluto and Misprint don't synergize with Vampire.\n\nTherefore, the best action here is \"round\\_select\". I'll use the cards I have.\n\nThere are no consumables and I've got the Jokers ordered correctly: +Mult (Bootstraps) then xMult (Vampire). No need to re-order. There's nothing in the shop that seems worth the money over just keeping what I have.\n\nAction: `round_select`\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
