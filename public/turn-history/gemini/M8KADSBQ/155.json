{"reasoning":"**Reroll Time!**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in the Shop phase, fresh off a Lucky Card, and need to make a solid decision here. I'm at Ante 6, with $79 in the bank. \"To the Moon\" is giving me extra interest, which is always nice, but I need to focus on feeding my Vampire Joker. Currently, I have a killer Joker setup, but no good options in the shop.\n\nI need to maximize Vampire's XMult. I have no other scaling options. I'm running: Crafty (chips on Flush), Four Fingers (Flush/Straight), To the Moon, Bootstraps (+30 Mult), Zany (+12 Mult), Vampire (X3.2 Mult), and Seltzer (retriggers cards). The key here is to feed Vampire with enhanced cards.\n\nLooking at the shop, \"Ride the Bus\" is useless, and \"Magic Trick\" is a tempting maybe. It offers more shop cards, and theoretically, some of those could be enhanced, but it's risky and usually a waste of money unless I find some niche card.\n\nThe shop is pretty weak, so it's time to roll the dice. I'm leaning towards a reroll for $5 to fish for Tarot or Standard packs to get my Vampire scaling. My money is high, and I can afford a couple of rerolls to see if I can find some good cards for Vampire.\n\nI need to make sure my Jokers are ordered properly. My \"Independent\" Jokers (Bootstraps, Zany) need to come *before* my XMult Joker (Vampire) for maximum effectiveness. So, that means my current order is correct: Bootstraps (+30 Mult) then Zany (+12 Mult) then Vampire (X3.2) is good. Seltzer is last for retrigger, it can come after.\n\nSo, the plan: Reroll the shop. Let's see if we can find something useful. I'll take a look at the card order again once I can see the new shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
