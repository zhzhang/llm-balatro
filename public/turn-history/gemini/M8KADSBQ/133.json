{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Evaluation: Round 13 Ante 5/8**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 13, Ante 5/8, and I'm in the SHOP phase with $67. My primary goal is to maximize chips to clear these upcoming blinds and ultimately conquer Ante 8. My core strategy leans towards Flushes and Three of a Kinds, leveraging Four Fingers, Crafty Joker, and Zany Joker respectively. Vampire is my scaling X-Mult, and Bootstraps is giving me a nice +Mult boost based on my money. And \"To the Moon\" is giving a HUGE bonus.\n\nCurrently, I've got a solid Joker setup: Crafty Joker, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany Joker, and Vampire. I've got some good vouchers too: Liquidation, Clearance Sale, and Hieroglyph.\n\nLooking at the shop, Joker Stencil is available, but that only offers X1 Mult per empty slot (and I've only got one empty slot after this), so that's not optimal right now unless I decide to sell a joker. Then there's Wily Joker, which provides +100 Chips if the played hand contains a Three of a Kind. That's a good card and seems very beneficial, since I'm often playing hands with both Flush and a 3OAK. Finally, there's the Celestial Pack, which is always worth a look for Jupiter (Flush synergy), Mercury (3OAK synergy), or Venus (3OAK synergy).\n\nWith $67 in my pocket, the smart play is to start with the Celestial Pack. It's dirt cheap at $2, and it directly improves the base stats, which is always worth it. Then I'll re-evaluate Wily Joker. It costs only $2. With both the Celestial Pack and the Wily Joker, I'll have $63 left. That leaves enough wiggle room to re-roll and see if I can find some better Jokers, or perhaps some Tarot cards to enhance Vampire.\n\nSo the immediate action is clear: `buy_booster 1`. It's the most cost-effective and permanent upgrade I can get right now. Gotta remember how awesome \"To the Moon\" is, which is giving me a HUGE interest bonus with that $67, with a bonus of $1 per $5. So, no matter what, I gotta try to stay rich here.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
