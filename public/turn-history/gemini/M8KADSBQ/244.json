{"reasoning":"**Strategic Pre-Flush Analysis**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 8, Round 22, big blind 75,000 – gotta stay ahead. Currently in the card selection phase. Money’s tight, $82, but let's see what we can do. Got three discards left and a decent hand: Ace, Jack, 10, 9, 5 of Spades plus some extras. I need 75k to move on. That's a low bar considering what's possible here.\n\nMy Jokers are interesting: Bootstraps for some flat mult, \"To the Moon\" giving interest (nice), Seltzer (retrigger!), Vampire which is key, a Baseball Card (another must-have), Hallucination (we’ll see), and Marble Joker (stone card). Got a \"Tower\" consumable in my pocket, which is pivotal here. I have a Flush ready to go, and the 9 of Spades is Holo AND re-triggers. Nice!\n\nWait…Vampire! It gains mult for each *scoring* enhanced card. The Jack of Hearts has Steel and the 9 of Clubs has Mult. I can use the Tower to turn another card into a Stone card.\n\nThe Stone card is key. I have to decide how to scale. I can just play the Flush for an easy win. The Spades hand will already get me more than 75k. Let's see...I could \"The Tower\" consumable on the 10 of Diamonds (Pos 9). This will become a Stone Card, which scores. Then I'll have Steel, Mult and Stone (Pos 7, 8 and 9) to feed Vampire.\n\nThis looks like a calculated gamble. I need to maximize Vampire, even if it means sacrificing this hand to some degree. I have three hands to work with here. Last Flush scored 497k, so this decision is strategic. Vampire can reach X4.0.\n\nShould I sell a Joker? No, all the Jokers are good and synergize well. The key is playing the right hand. If I just play the flush, Vampire is at X3.7. No. I need to get it higher.\n\nI need a high score to get through the boss. Is there any reason NOT to use the Tower now? No.\n\nUsing the Tower on the 10 of Diamonds is a good setup. Then I can play [Jack Hearts, 9 Clubs, and Stone 10 Diamonds] together in Hand 1. Vampire will eat Steel, Mult, Stone (three enhanced, scoring cards) and become even stronger (X4.0). Then play the Flush in Hand 2, and I should have plenty of chips to move on.\n\nNow the syntax...it's `use_consumable` with a list of card positions. It's: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 9]}`. And remember, the 9 of Spades is *Holographic*, not an enhancement. So it stays.\n\nOne last check on the Joker order: It's good. Baseball Card goes *after* the Uncommon Jokers so that those Jokers can scale. The X-mults order doesn't matter, as long as the base mults are before them.\n\nDecision: Use \"The Tower\" to turn the 10 of Diamonds into a Stone card to maximize Vampire's growth. Time to scale Vampire. Action!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,9]"}
