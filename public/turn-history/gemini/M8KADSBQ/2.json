{"reasoning":"**The Hand Assessment**\n\nAlright, let's take a look at this hand. Big blind, 1/8 ante, 450 chips needed. I'm starting at zero with only $4, and I have 4 hands and 4 discards. I've got this Uncommon Tag which *should* give me a free Uncommon Joker in the next shop, which will come in handy.\n\nI'm holding: 4 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, King of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, and 3 of Clubs. My initial thought is to go for a pair of sevens, but I need 450 chips to win, which is beyond the capacity of a pair hand. A pair of 7s nets about 48 chips if played and 10 base with 2 mult. However, that's not going to get me to 450. I need to aim higher, like a Flush or even better, a Straight or Full House.\n\nOkay, I have four Clubs: King, 10, 7, and 3. I'm going to discard the other four cards to try and get a Flush. There are nine Clubs left in the deck, which means I've got a decent shot. Discarding everything but the Clubs gives me the best odds. I'll need a club (1 - (35/44 * 34/43 * 33/42 * 32/41) ≈ 62%). So, I'll discard cards in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. That’s: 4 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, and 2 of Hearts.\n\nWait, should I reconsider playing the pair? No, I am keeping my discards and hands available for a higher paying scoring hand. I will discard those 4 cards. That is the only real play. A Straight is not possible with these cards.\n\nSo, the action is \"discard,\" and the positions I'm discarding are [1, 2, 3, 4]. I have `intended_hand_type` as null and `estimated_chips` at null as they are not pertinent to a discard.\n\nHere we go!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4]"}
