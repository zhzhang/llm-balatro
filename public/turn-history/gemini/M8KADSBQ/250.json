{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Planet Pack**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 22, and the game phase is PLANET_PACK. I've got $92, which is healthy. My inventory is looking pretty good, but needs to be optimized for the upcoming boss blind. I have six Jokers, with a max of seven. My primary hand is Flush, currently at Level 6, and I've been getting consistent chip counts of around 470k-500k.\n\nLooking at my Jokers, Vampire is a key multiplier (X3.9) and the Baseball Card should boost my Uncommon Jokers (Bootstraps, To the Moon, Vampire, Marble Joker). I need to make sure that the order of the Jokers isn't going to impact the calculations; + mult goes on the left of X mult. Vampire is at pos 3, Bootstraps is at pos 1, so this is fine.\n\nMy pack choices are Jupiter (Flush upgrade), Uranus (Two Pair upgrade), and Mercury (Pair upgrade). Given my focus on Flushes, Jupiter is the clear winner, as it directly levels up the hand type I'm using. Hallucination didn't trigger a tarot card, so I can ignore that for now.\n\nThe plan is to select Jupiter to level up my Flush, which will give me +2 Mult and +15 chips.\n\nThe action I need to take is `select 1`, which is the JSON command. The JSON payload is:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
