{"reasoning":"**Current Round Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 8, with $82 to play with. My primary goal is to maximize my score against the boss blind. I've got a decent hand, but I see a clear path to improvement.\n\nRight now, I'm holding a strong Joker lineup: Zany Joker (negligible), Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination. I have a Tower enhancement ready, and the shop has Marble Joker and Sly Joker.\n\nThe linchpin here is the Baseball Card, which gives a 1.5x multiplier to my Uncommon Jokers. Currently, I have five: Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, and Vampire. That's a solid 7.59x multiplier already. The Marble Joker is also Uncommon, which would bring that up to a staggering 11.39x! That's a huge potential boost.\n\nHere's the problem: I have 8 slots, filled by 8 Jokers. Two are negative Jokers (Zany, Hallucination, To the Moon) that give extra slots. I need to sell a joker. The question is: which one? And can I afford Marble Joker? I can afford the $3 price tag.\n\nInitially, my plan was to sell Zany Joker, since it provides the lowest value. Then, I considered selling Hallucination for tarot generation, but I'm thinking the extra Tarot draw is not worth it, and that the Shop is nearly empty at this stage.\n\nThen I realized I have to sell a non-negative Joker. I need to free up a spot to buy Marble. I have to make a tough decision:\n\n*   **Four Fingers:** Makes flush/straight very easy.\n*   **Seltzer:** Temporary, double triggers.\n*   **Bootstraps:** +32 mult (good!).\n\nI think about the math. A 1.5x boost from Baseball Card is a *global* multiplier on all my score. But is that better than a flat +32 mult, or good hand making potential? I have a strong flush already. I realize that Marble Joker's true potential is amplified by the fact that I have Vampire (X3.7 mult). If I can stack that with a higher Baseball Card multiplier, that is a huge score. Marble Joker creates a Stone card every time. The Stone card goes to Vampire.\n\nOkay, here's my plan. I need to sell the Zany Joker, then sell Four Fingers. Then I'll have room for the Marble Joker. That's a pretty aggressive swap. Let's make sure.\n\nFirst, I sell Zany to free up a slot and get me to 7 Jokers. Then I sell a base Joker: Four Fingers. This gets me down to 6 Jokers and 6 slots. Then I can buy Marble Joker for 7/7, triggering the Baseball Card effect. This will be a *huge* multiplier.\n\nSo, let's start with `sell_joker 1`. I need to get rid of that Zany Joker. Then, I'll analyze the shop. Done.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
