{"reasoning":"**Round Analysis and Action Plan**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante is 8/8, and we're at the final blind of 50,000 chips. I'm starting with zero chips, $72, and a hand size of 9. I've got \"The Devil\" and \"The Hanged Man\" consumables. Let's see...\n\nI'm thinking about scaling the Vampire joker, which gets a multiplier based on *scoring* enhanced cards. So I need to use those enhancements. I have the King of Spades (Glass), and can make another enhanced card.\n\nHand: King of Spades (Glass), 9 of Spades (Holo), 10 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, and 4 of Diamonds.\n\nJokers are Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination.\n\nMy plan: Use \"The Hanged Man\" on the 2 of Hearts and 4 of Diamonds to clear out some junk and thin the deck. Then, use \"The Devil\" on a Diamond (let's say the Jack of Diamonds) to make it Gold. With the \"Four Fingers\" joker, I'll discard to find a 4-card Flush and feed the Vampire Joker.\n\nHowever, I just realized that the Vampire Joker *eats* the enhancements, so the King of Spades (Glass) will *become a normal card* but the Vampire gets X0.1.\n\nOkay, let's start with \"The Hanged Man\" to clear those two low cards. I'm remembering the JSON schema. The \"positions\" field should be an array where the first element is the consumable index. So, I will **use the Hanged Man** and remove the 2 of Hearts (pos 4) and the 4 of Diamonds (pos 9).\n\nFinal JSON action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [2, 4, 9]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,4,9]"}
