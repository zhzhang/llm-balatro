{"reasoning":"**The Calculated Gamble**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 7, Round 18. Shop step. $59 in the bank. I've got a decent engine going: Uncommon Jokers boosted by Baseball Card. Vampire is the key, needing enhanced cards to really scale. I have Justice (Enhance to Glass) and The Hanged Man (destroy 2) in my pocket. I also see some good vouchers available to me.\n\nMy first thought is always the balance of power and efficiency. I want \"The Tower\" in the shop, but I'm full on consumables. I want a card for Vampire, right now. I have The Hanged Man and Justice.\n\nOkay, let's step back, what can I do in the shop? I need a card for Vampire to eat later. Can't buy \"The Tower\", I already have 2 consumables. Let's look at the booster packs. Jumbo Standard Pack is $3. It *might* have an enhanced card. $2 Standard Pack as well. Worth a look. A gamble.\n\nThe Baseball Card is key. Uncommon Jokers get X1.5 Mult. Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire. Then Baseball Card.\n\nThe order matters: Base chips/mult, then card scoring, then Vampire (Uncommon) -> x3.3 * X1.5, then the rest. Bootstraps first, then Vampire at the end. Bootstraps' +22 is very good. And that's before the Baseball X1.5.\n\nMy money situation is pretty good. I want to keep about $50 for interest cap later. To the Moon helps.\n\nLet's look at the action options: buy\\_booster \\[1]. I like the Jumbo Pack. Buy it. I'm taking the Jumbo Pack.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'll take the Jumbo Standard Pack. Then, I can either enter the round and use my consumables or check out other actions.\n\nI should also check my Joker order one last time before committing. Bootstraps first, then Vampire. And then buy the pack. Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card.\n\nThe Jumbo Standard Pack it is.\nThe plan is:\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
