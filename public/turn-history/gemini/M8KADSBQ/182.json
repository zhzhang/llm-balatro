{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Prioritizing Multiplier Optimization**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Round 17, and I'm at the SHOP phase with $51. My primary focus right now is maximizing my multiplier, specifically given my current joker composition. I've got a solid engine built around Crafty, Four Fingers, Vampire, and Seltzer. I have a Flush at Level 5, that is my scoring base. The key is to leverage my existing synergies.\n\nThe shop offers Madness and a Baseball Card. Madness is a non-starter; it would destroy a joker in my engine for a paltry multiplier. The Baseball Card, though, that's where things get interesting. It's a rare joker that provides a multiplier to uncommon jokers.\n\nCurrently, I have a *lot* of Uncommon Jokers: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Vampire, and Seltzer. That's *five* uncommon jokers. So the Baseball Card would give me (1.5)^5 = x7.59 multiplier. The thing is, I'm at the max of 7/7 joker slots.\n\nTo get the Baseball Card, I *have* to sell one.\n\nMy Jokers:\n\n1.  Crafty: +80 chips on flush, a Common Joker.\n2.  Four Fingers: 4-card Flush/Straight, Uncommon.\n3.  To the Moon: Negative, +1 slot, extra interest, Uncommon.\n4.  Bootstraps: +2 Mult per $5, currently +20, Uncommon.\n5.  Zany: Negative, +1 slot, +12 Mult on 3OAK, Common.\n6.  Vampire: X3.3 Mult, eats enhancements, Uncommon.\n7.  Seltzer: Retriggers played cards, Uncommon.\n\nI have two negative Jokers. Selling one will reduce my joker slot count. Not ideal. The key is to optimize for the best possible multiplier gain.\n\nI need to decide: which joker to sell. Crafty seems like the weakest link, a flat chip bonus is less valuable than a scaling multiplier. Let's do a comparison.\n\nLet's do the math on a Flush with *Baseball Card*. Right now, I can hit about 35,000 score with the current setup. With Baseball Card, it will be 166,402. Way better.\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1.  Sell Crafty (Joker 1).\n2.  Buy Baseball Card (Shop Position 2).\n\nThe selling action must happen before buying. Let's execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
