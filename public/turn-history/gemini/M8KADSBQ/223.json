{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm deep into the game, at Ante 8, and the Shop phase has just appeared after purchasing a Standard Pack, and triggering Hallucination, and so I have \"The Devil\" in my inventory. I have $84, and I'm sporting a strong Joker setup. My current Jokers are: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To The Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination.\n\nMy Uncommon Jokers are generating solid multipliers and I have a great setup with: Bootstraps (+32 Mult, +1.5 from Baseball), Four Fingers (+1.5 Mult), To The Moon (+1.5 Mult), Seltzer (+1.5 Mult), Vampire (X3.5, +1.5 from Baseball),. The Baseball Card makes all the Uncommon Jokers trigger an additional x1.5 Mult when they are triggered. Vampire is sitting at X3.5 with the potential to rise with more enhanced cards. I can place Zany and Hallucination, since these are \"Negative\" and don't take up slots.\n\nI have The Devil consumable and I can use it to enhance a card. I have to wait to play a round to use it. I'm in the Shop.\n\nMy primary goal is to maximize my score for the upcoming blinds, likely a Boss Blind. My current focus is to find Tarot cards to feed the Vampire Joker. Since I'm in the shop, I can't currently use The Devil consumable to enhance a card in my hand. I could also find Planet cards (Jupiter) to level up my Flushes, but the shop has Mercury only (Level up Pairs).\n\nI'm considering a shop reroll. Rerolling costs $5. It'll cost me 2 Mult from Bootstraps, but the benefit of finding a pack or Tarot card is great.\n\nRerolling has a few advantages:\n*   Chance of finding another Booster Pack (triggering Hallucination for The Devil).\n*   Potential for finding planet cards or other cards that I can use in a round.\n*   The overall goal is maximizing Vampire's Multiplier with Tarot Cards.\n\nThe shop displays Square Joker and Mercury. I'm not interested in those.\n\nSince I am at the Boss Blind, I should use all resources available to maximize the score in the round. With Hallucination and the Vampire, a single reroll to find more Tarot cards or a pack has a good chance to pay off.\n\nThe prompt requires the generation of only JSON. My action is a reroll.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
