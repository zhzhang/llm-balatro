{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy: Maximizing Vampire for Long-Term Growth**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante is at 6/8, round 15, and I've got $84. My current joker setup is pretty solid, but the key here is Vampire and how to feed it. I've got a Seltzer active for 10 hands, and I need to leverage it.\n\nThe shop has Ride the Bus, which is a hard pass. I'm focusing on Face cards, and that card resets on them. Not my strategy. Standard packs are where it's at; these packs give playing cards, which are food for my Vampire joker. Enhanced cards are perfect; things like Bonus, Mult, and Gold are exactly what I need.\n\nMagic Trick isn't a priority right now, and the Reroll isn't either, unless I'm really desperate for a specific Tarot or Planet card.\n\nNow, Seltzer is the key to amplifying Vampire's effect. If I play an enhanced card, Vampire triggers, *removes* the enhancement, and then Seltzer retriggers the hand. I have to remember that, according to the text, Vampire only triggers once *per card*, per hand. So, Vampire triggers on scoring. And Seltzer will then score the same card again, but the enhancement has been removed. However, Seltzer still doubles the initial chips of the card, and anything that modifies chips/mult before it gets removed.\n\nMoney-wise, I'm sitting pretty with $84. To the Moon is giving me extra interest. And Bootstraps is giving +32 mult. Every $5 spent reduces Bootstraps by 2 mult. But I don't really care.\n\nRight now, the best move is to buy packs to feed Vampire. The Jumbo Standard Pack is the best bet to find enhanced cards, which will increase Vampire's XMult growth. The Standard Pack is a second best, but it gives fewer cards.\n\nMy immediate action is: `buy_booster 1` (Jumbo Standard Pack for $3) and `buy_booster 2` (Standard pack for $2). A total of $5, taking me down from +32 to +30 mult, but negligible for what I'll gain with Vampire. I'll check those packs before I even *think* about rerolling the shop for Tarot or Planet cards. The Jumbo pack has better odds (5 cards).\n\nSo, the action will be `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`. I have no room for any more jokers. This also leaves me with a good chunk of money, so I will be able to capitalize on both Bootstraps and To the Moon. Seltzer is active and I should aim to maximize its use in the coming hands.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
