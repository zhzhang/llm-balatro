{"reasoning":"**Boss Blind Conundrum**\n\nAlright, it's time to dive into this Balatro round. I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase, staring down a Boss Blind. The system calls it \"The Pillar\", but the provided description is \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played.\" Wait a minute, that's not right. \"The Pillar\" has a debuff, not the face-down thing. Let's see... is this The Manacle? The Psychic? The Window? The Hook? The Serpent? No, no, no... what is the boss?!\n\nOkay, let's take a deep breath. \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\". This is, according to the official description, \"The Pillar\"? No, it must be the House? No, no, no... My previous thoughts incorrectly associated the debuffing Pillar to the current description. \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\". Is this The Manacle? Nope! Ah, the correct name is **The Hidden**, yes.\n\nRegardless of the name, the goal is clear: Beat 1600 chips to move forward. Looking at my current setup, I've got a decent hand: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire. Bootstraps is +Mult, Vampire is xMult. I have $5 and need 1600 chips to clear the blind.\n\nSo, the only sensible move now is to `play_round`. I skipped the shop on Turn 44, so that's not an option.\n\nBefore committing, let's double-check the Joker order. Bootstraps (adds Mult) should come before Vampire (multiplies Mult). The optimal order is: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps (+2 Mult), Vampire (x1.2 Mult). Since Bootstraps is +Mult and Vampire is xMult, I should ensure Bootstraps triggers before Vampire.\nVampire is x1.2.\nBootstraps is +2.\nBase mult for flush is 4.\nTotal Mult = (4 + 2) * 1.2 = 7.2.\nThat's the correct order due to the left-to-right activation of independent Jokers.\n\nOkay, let's make sure I've got this Boss description correct: \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\" is for **The Hidden**. Wait, the prompt description says:\nBoss Description: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\nActually, that's **The Hidden**.\nWait, no. **The Hidden** is \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\"? No.\n**The Manacle**: -1 hand size.\n**The Psychic**: Must play 5 cards.\n**The Pillar**: Cards played this Ante are debuffed.\n**The Hook**: Discards 2 random cards per hand played.\n**The Eye**: No repeat hand types this round.\n**The Mouth**: Play only 1 hand type this round.\n**The Serpent**: After Play or Discard, always draw 3 cards.\n**The Fish**: Cards drawn face down after each hand played. (Wait, is it Fish? No, Fish is cards drawn face down after each *hand played*? Yes).\n\nOkay, that's definitely \"The Hidden.\"\n\nFinal decision: I'm playing the round. `play_round`. Let's do this.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
