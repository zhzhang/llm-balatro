{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Pack in Balatro**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `STANDARD_PACK` stage of Balatro. The goal is simple: pick a card. Let's see what we've got to work with. My current Jokers are pretty interesting: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire. The key here is definitely the Vampire, I need to get it fed.\n\nLooking at the pack, the options are: Ace of Diamonds (Base), Ace of Diamonds (Gold enhancement), 9 of Diamonds (Base), King of Clubs (Base), and 2 of Clubs (Base).\n\nImmediately, the second card, the Ace of Diamonds, jumps out. It has the *Gold* enhancement. My goal is to use the Vampire to scale, and the Vampire gains X0.1 Mult per scoring *Enhanced* card played. The *Gold* Ace of Diamonds fits the bill perfectly! It will be a scoring Enhanced card. The secondary description confirms it: \"$3 when this card is played and scores\" which signifies the Gold card.\n\nSo, the strategy is simple. I *need* to pick that Gold Ace. Doing so will make the Vampire much more powerful, which is what I want.\n\nSince I am picking a card from the pack, the command is `select <pack_card_position>`. In this case, `select 2`.\n\nNow, before I commit, let's take a quick look at my money and the interest: I have $43. With the \"To the Moon\" Joker, I'm earning some serious interest. Actually, Bootstraps is giving me the mult. I am currently at +16 Mult with Bootstraps, which makes sense. 43/5 is 8.6, which I round down. 8 * 2 = +16 mult.\n\nAlright, decision time. I'm going to grab that Gold Ace of Diamonds. No second-guessing.\n\nThe action is `select` and the position is `[2]`. This means that I will pick the second card in the pack. This should work; standard pack selection doesn't require further targeting!\n\nOkay, let's double-check again that this Gold Ace is the right move. The Vampire is the key to scaling the hand and winning this game. The Gold Ace should be perfect. Yep, the Gold Ace is the right choice. Let me make sure I pick the right card and then feed my Vampire.\n\nThe JSON looks correct to me:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\nLet's do it.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
