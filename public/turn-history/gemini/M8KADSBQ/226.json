{"reasoning":"**Strategic Evaluation and Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thought process. I'm in Ante 8, Round 20, the final ante. I've got $72 and a pretty solid joker setup. I need to make the best play to secure the win.\n\nFirst, I assessed my Jokers and their optimal order. I have a Baseball Card that multiplies Uncommon Jokers, so I need to make sure those are positioned correctly relative to additive multipliers and the Vampire's multiplicative effect. After analyzing the interactions, the current order of Jokers is confirmed to be optimal, with the additive bonuses before the multiplicative ones.\n\nNext, I looked at the shop. I've already bought *The Hanged Man* in a prior thought. Now I'm considering what to do with the shop options. I have *The Devil*. I also see a Queen of Hearts, but I doubt I should buy it. I have consumables to use, but I can't use them in the shop. I would like more packs if the shop had them, but I need to make sure I have space. I have $72, and I'm debating rerolling the shop, but I have already spent the money for the consumable cards. I'm trying to decide if the cost of rerolling, given my money and the Bootstraps joker, is worth it. Rerolling has downsides.\n\nMy strategy check is that I'm flush with money, and my consumables are full. The shop doesn't have anything that's a *must-buy*, and rerolling feels risky. Buying the Queen of Hearts is marginal since it's just a card and it's better to save money for Bootstraps. Hallucination might trigger, but I don't want to overextend. I'm prioritizing interest generation.\n\nThe final evaluation is that I don't see any compelling reason to stay in the shop or rearrange my deck. Given the lack of shop options and my strong Joker setup, it's best to proceed to the next round, maximizing my score with the existing Jokers and money.\n\nAfter the round selection, I need to check my work. Should I have bought the Queen of Hearts? It appears the Queen of Hearts in the shop, which could be a Bonus Card, is marginal and a waste of money, since +0.1 Mult for Vampire is a tiny effect.\n\nFinally, I remember the prior goal to proceed to the boss. I will continue that.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
