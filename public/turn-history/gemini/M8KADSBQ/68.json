{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Decision: Feeding the Vampire**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the SHOP phase of Ante 3, Round 7 of a `STANDARD_PACK` game. I'm looking to maximize my scaling potential, and right now that means one thing: feeding my `Vampire` Joker. It's sitting at X1.9 Mult and needs enhanced cards to really get going, gaining X0.1 Mult for each one played.\n\nLooking at my inventory, I've got the `Vampire`, along with `Four Fingers`, `To the Moon`, and `Bootstraps`. I'm sitting on $18, have one open Joker slot, and no consumables.\n\nThe pack choices are: a `2 of Diamonds` (Gold Card enhancement), a `10 of Diamonds`, and a `Queen of Diamonds`. The `2 of Diamonds` is the clear winner here. Even though it's a low-value card, the Gold Card enhancement is exactly what I need. Playing it in a scoring hand will boost the `Vampire`’s multiplier, and while it will consume the enhancement, that's the whole point. I could hold it in hand to gain $3, but again, the `Vampire` is what's key. Therefore, the play is obvious. I will select the `2 of Diamonds`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
