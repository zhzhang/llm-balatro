{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis - Round 11, Ante 4/8**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Round 11, Ante 4/8. I'm in the shop phase, post-rearrangement. I've got $32 in the bank, and that \"To the Moon\" joker is working overtime on interest. I'm currently looking at a hand that has a Crafty Joker at the moment. My other Jokers are: \"Four Fingers\", \"Bootstraps\", \"Zany Joker\", and \"Vampire.\" I also have the consumables \"The Sun\" and \"Strength.\"\n\nThe shop is completely barren. No cards, no boosters, no vouchers, nothing! Rerolling costs $7, but there's no point. I'll get that interest, though. With \"To the Moon\" and the base interest, I'm potentially looking at a significant return this round if the cap allows.\n\nNo, I don't see any value in burning a consumable right now either. \"The Sun\" and \"Strength\" are going to be useless until a hand actually comes up with cards to target.\n\nAlright, with nothing to buy, let's rearrange these Jokers just to ensure optimal placement.\n\nTime to move on. Let's hit the next round, The Arm. I'll execute the `round_select` command. Let's see what we're up against.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
