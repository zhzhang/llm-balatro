{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decisions - Ante 5/8, Round 14**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: $76 in the bank, and the shop's open. Interest is looking good, currently at $20 (standard $5 capped, plus \"To the Moon\" which adds $1 per $5 at the end of the round). I'm rocking a Flush-focused build – Crafty Joker, Four Fingers, all the usual suspects. Vampire is my primary X-Mult scaler, and Bootstraps is giving me a solid base Mult.\n\nThe shop has a few options. Venus for $1 is tempting for 3OAK, but I'm primarily Flush-oriented, and it's not a priority. Flash Card could be interesting (+2 Mult per reroll), but it'll take time to ramp up, and Bootstraps is already providing +30 Mult. Effectively it's a 1:1 trade, but I also lose the gold for Bootstraps, plus the interest. With just a few rounds left, I'm leaning against it.\n\nMy top priorities are the Celestial Pack and the Jumbo Standard Pack. The Celestial Pack has a chance for Jupiter, which would boost my Flush hand level, giving me more Chips and Mult. The Jumbo Standard Pack offers enhanced cards that Vampire can consume to scale up my X-Mult, which is essential. I need to get those multipliers up.\n\nSo, the plan is: **Buy Celestial Pack first**. Then, I'll grab the Jumbo Standard Pack. I'll need to check my remaining money and consider Venus and Flash Card at the end. I'm feeling safe.\n\nI'm thinking ahead to the upcoming Club boss blind, which debuffs Clubs. It doesn't affect my Flush build, but it's something to be aware of, but I'm going to take this round one step at a time, keeping it simple.\n\nHere's the JSON representing my planned shop purchase:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\nWait, before I commit, I should double check the prices. I have Liquidation and Clearance Sale – are those stacked? It says 50% and then 25% off. Everything is very cheap, so all the more reason to buy these packs.\n\nChecking my Joker order again: Crafty, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany, Vampire. Vampire is at the end, as expected, multiplying everything else.\n\nOkay, I'm confident in the Celestial Pack first. Let's do this.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
