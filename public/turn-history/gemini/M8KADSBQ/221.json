{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Final Ante Shop**\n\nOkay, final Ante, round 20. The pressure's on to maximize this score with the hand I've got. Let's see... I'm sitting on $86. Jokers are locked in: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination. That Baseball Card is really boosting the Uncommon Jokers – with five active, that's a cool 7.59x multiplier just from them!\n\nMy current focus is on getting Hallucination to trigger because a Tarot card, *especially* an enhancement, could be a game-changer for Vampire. I can use my final Ante to focus on getting Hallucination to trigger. I need to make the best use of my remaining money.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Standard Pack is the key. For $2, it has the best chance to trigger Hallucination and give Vampire an advantage with the cards that are generated. Buying Mercury for $1 is tempting to level Pairs, but I primarily play Flushes. I could reroll the shop, but that's $5, and the benefit is not clear.\n\nSo, the play is clear: I'll buy that Standard Pack, since it is a 1 in 2 chance to trigger Hallucination. Money drops to $84, and Bootstraps loses a tiny bit of value.\n\nI can't go wrong here and should trigger that. The order of operations, from my point of view, is:\n\n1.  **Buy Booster**: I need to take a Standard Pack, the second option in the Shop, since that is the most relevant. I should check the pack's contents and analyze those cards to determine the most important action.\n\n**Action: `buy_booster`**\n**Positions: `[1]`**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
