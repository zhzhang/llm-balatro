{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shopping Spree: Spectral Pack Acquisition**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, just finished Round 7, and it's SHOP time. I've got $26, which is a comfortable amount to work with, especially considering my Jokers: Four Fingers for Flushes/Straights, To the Moon for that sweet interest (which is actually a +1 extra interest for every $5), Bootstraps for the juicy Multiplier (+10 currently), and Vampire, which is my bread and butter (X1.9 Mult right now, growing with enhanced cards). I also have Hieroglyph, which is clutch for avoiding bad bosses.\n\nThe shop itself has Pluto (High Card leveling – not my priority), Misprint (random Mult, meh), a Standard Pack (potential enhanced cards for Vampire), a Spectral Pack (high-risk, high-reward), and Director's Cut ($10, useful for avoiding those annoying boss debuffs).\n\nMy focus is maximizing score and long-term potential. With $26, I can buy something and still keep over $20 to maximize To the Moon's interest, which is the goal. I should probably get a spectral booster.\n\nI'm thinking: Vampire *needs* those enhanced cards to grow, and Spectral packs are the best way to get them - Aura, Sigil, Ouija, etc. Standard packs are a decent backup plan. The $10 Director's Cut is pricey right now, Misprint is just okay, and Pluto is completely useless for my build.\n\nSo, the plan is to prioritize the Spectral Pack. Let's see... what's the command? Ah, right, `buy_booster <position>`. The Spectral Pack is in position 2. So the command is `buy_booster 2`.\n\nThat leaves me with $22. With $22, I'll earn $8 interest from To the Moon + Bootstraps will be at +8 Mult.\n\nSo, the action is \"buy_booster\" with position [2].\n\nLet's do this. I've got a valid schema to work with.\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}` - Valid.\nThis should be a good move.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
