{"reasoning":"**Strategic Pack Acquisition**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante 6, Round 17. I'm sitting on $73. My Joker lineup is pretty solid: Crafty, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany, Vampire, and Seltzer. My Flush is level 5, generating a respectable 95 chips and 12 multiplier. Vouchers are Liquidation, Magic Trick, Clearance Sale, and Hieroglyph.\n\nLooking at the shop, the 4 of Clubs is useless, Superposition is a no-go given my Joker slots and needing an Ace, but I've got a Jumbo Standard Pack on sale for a steal at $3. Standard packs are usually a great move because of enhanced cards - Bonus, Mult, Glass, Steel, all of which Vampire can absorb to scale up its xMult.\n\nWait, Vampire! That's the key here. I have to remember that Vampire *removes* enhancements. Right now, Vampire is at x3.3. Buying an enhanced card from the shop or a pack and playing it will beef up Vampire. With Bootstraps giving +28 Mult and To the Moon giving me potentially huge interest – $19 at $70 – keeping money high is crucial for maximum benefit.\n\nThe Jumbo Standard Pack is the best play here. It's cheap, and I'll still have $70 after the purchase. This means maintaining that high interest and Bootstraps multiplication. Let's make this happen. I'll buy that pack and look for something shiny to feed to Vampire.\n\n`buy_booster 1`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
