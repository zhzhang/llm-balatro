{"reasoning":"**Decision Time in the Shop**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante is 8/8, and I'm about to face the Big Blind, or the Boss – it’s Shop time. I’ve got $84 in the bank. Joker Slots are maxed out at 7/7 because I smartly sold that Zany Joker to get an extra slot. Let’s inventory: I've got Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination. Also, a Tower Stone card enhancement, ready to go. The shop’s offering a Marble Joker and a Sly Joker.\n\nThe core of my engine is this: Baseball Card multiplies Uncommon Joker mult. Right now, I have Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, and Vampire which gets me to around 7.59x from Baseball Card. That multiplier then hits the flat +32 from Bootstraps and the 3.7x from Vampire. Seltzer is a huge bonus for retriggering cards, which I can use with Vampire.\n\nThe Marble Joker is Uncommon and adds a Stone card to my deck every blind. This is key to consistently scaling Vampire. It is a powerful long-term play.\n\nProblem: I have no free slots.\n\nI need to decide which Joker to jettison. Hallucination is Common and Negative, but selling it doesn't give me a free slot. To the Moon is Uncommon and Negative, so it’s not an ideal choice. Four Fingers makes hand assembly easier, but Marble Joker + Vampire + Baseball Card is more powerful. Seltzer is too valuable. Bootstraps is too much base mult.\n\nWait… I *did* sell Zany, a negative Joker, last turn! Which means it should not affect the current free slot count. My current 7/7 slots are: Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, Hallucination.\n\nFour Fingers is the least \"score\"-based. With a Flush-oriented deck, I can live without it. Selling it opens a slot. Then, I can add Marble Joker. \n\nI *will* have an empty slot after the sell, which is what I need.\n\nAfter selling Four Fingers, I will have Bootstraps, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, and Marble Joker. The Baseball Card multiplier will stay at 7.59x because I still have 5 Uncommons (Bootstraps, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, and Marble).\n\nThe Marble Joker adds a Stone Card to the deck every blind, and Vampire eats the Stone Card for a mult boost. I'll also use The Tower stone card to feed Vampire, which is my scaling engine.\n\nI’m set: Sell Four Fingers and then grab Marble Joker.\n\nI can check Sly Joker, but +50 Chips isn't worth it. Reroll costs $5. I've got $84. I should lock in Marble.\n\nHere's the plan: \n\n1.  Sell Joker 2 (Four Fingers).\n2.  Buy Joker 1 (Marble Joker).\n\nNow, execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
