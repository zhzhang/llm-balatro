{"reasoning":"**The Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking right now. Ante 6/8, Round 16, just finished the Small Blind, and I'm in the shop. I've got $73. My current setup is pretty sweet: Crafty (+80 chips if Flush), Four Fingers (for those sweet Diamond/Club flushes), To the Moon (extra interest, which I need), Bootstraps (+2 Mult per $5, currently +28), Zany (extra slot filler with a conditional +12 Mult), Vampire (x3.2 Multiplier), and Seltzer (retriggers everything!).\n\nMy current goal is to get ready for the Big Blind at Ante 6, but right now I'm dealing with these Jumbo Buffoon Pack choices. I'm looking at: \"Seeing Double\" (x2 Mult if a Club *and* another suit), \"Reserved Parking\" (face cards give $1), \"Green Joker\" (+Mult per hand, -Mult per discard), and \"Gluttonous Joker\" (+3 Mult per Club).\n\n\"Seeing Double\" is the main one that catches my eye because that's an x2. My core strategy *right now* is all about Diamond/Club hybrid play, which means Four Fingers is key. With Four Fingers, it's pretty easy to get that Club card. I've got Vampire (x3.2) and Bootstraps (+28) and adding an additional x2 would be huge, but I'm thinking about the club requirement. It's a risk! I have a diamond-heavy deck: 17 diamonds left versus 11 clubs.\n\n\"Reserved Parking\" could help with money, but I already have $73 and \"To The Moon\" for interest. \"Green Joker\" isn't great because I discard a lot to find flushes. \"Gluttonous Joker\" is just weak compared to what I already have.\n\nI've got 7 Jokers total. Currently: base 5, plus 1 for \"To the Moon\" and \"Zany.\" So I have 7 slots. My existing Jokers: Crafty, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany, Vampire, and Seltzer. If I want to take \"Seeing Double\", I *have* to sell one of the others that isn't negative.\n\n\"Crafty\" gives +80 chips, which is good for base score. \"Four Fingers\" is essential for the Diamond/Club strategy I need to have \"Seeing Double\" trigger. \"Bootstraps\" is a solid +28 Mult (and growing). \"Vampire\" is a strong x3.2 Mult. \"Seltzer\" doubles *everything* (cards and some jokers), which is huge.\n\nHold on, is \"Seeing Double\" actually better than what I have? It's just x2. If I replace Crafty with \"Seeing Double\", I'd lose base score. Bootstraps is giving me +28 Mult. Is x2 better than 28? Base mult is 8 (from flush level 3), +12 (Zany) or 8. X2 would change 8 to 16, so gain 8. Bootstraps is better. Vampire is a stronger x3.2. Seltzer is X2 for everything.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Seeing Double\" is probably not better than my current setup. It requires a club. But if I don't trigger the club, it's useless. And, if I'm unlucky with the draws... I'm looking at it: it seems like no joker is clearly better than my current setup.\n\nI'll skip the pack. I want to keep this perfect synergy.\n\nWait, check the negative Jokers again. To the Moon, Zany... Total Slots = 7. If I take \"Seeing Double\", I have to sell one.\n\nOkay, is \"Seeing Double\" worth selling Crafty? Crafty is 80 chips. With Seltzer, the total chips with Crafty = 145 * Mult, without Crafty = 65 * Mult *2. I'll need to figure out mult: (8+28) *3.2, which is 115.2. With Crafty (145 * 115.2) = 16,704... or (65 * (115.2 * 2)) = 14,976. Ah, with seeing double (X2), it's 32,486, way better. But that relies on me actually hitting the club. With the current chips, I should be scoring around 25,459 with the cards, so I'm already\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
