{"reasoning":"**My Assessment of the Jumbo Arcana Pack**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's the second ante, and I've got $7. The \"Four Fingers\" Joker is key here, facilitating flushes and straights with just four cards. My hand isn't amazing: a Steel 7 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, and a 2 of Diamonds. Not ideal, but Four Fingers can make something of it.\n\nLooking at the pack, \"The Empress\" for mult is tempting, but I don't have the ideal cards for that. \"The Hermit\" would double my money, taking me to $14. That's a good amount early on. \"The Star\" can convert three cards to Diamonds, which seems tailor-made for \"Four Fingers\" because I can build flushes very easily. \"The Chariot\" is okay, but I already have a Steel card. \"The Hierophant\" is just a chips boost, and in general, economy/consistency usually wins early.\n\nThe key thing is $14 puts me in a great spot to start collecting interest. Earlier I saw \"Bootstraps\" and \"To the Moon\" in the shop, which cost $7 and $5 respectively. If I go \"Hermit\", I can get both!\n\nIf I take \"The Hermit\", I get $14.\nIf I buy \"Bootstraps\" I get +4 Mult.\nIf I buy \"To the Moon\", my interest generation is accelerated.\n\nSo, let's seriously consider \"The Star.\" Converting three cards gives me 12 Diamonds in the deck, which improves the odds of a four-card Diamond flush significantly with Four Fingers.\n\nHowever, $14 is still a solid starting point.\n\nNow, wait a minute... I had $13 before buying the pack, and this is where I got the $7 from. It looks like I had $7 last round, too. \"The Hermit\" could have started this...\n\nI have to look at \"Four Fingers\" again. I need scaling mult, and that's \"Bootstraps\". I need interest, and that's \"To the Moon\". This is an \"economy build\".\n\nIf I take \"The Hermit\":\n1.  Select \"The Hermit\".\n2.  Money becomes $14.\n3.  Buy \"To the Moon\" ($5). Money = $9.\n4.  Buy \"Bootstraps\" ($7). Money = $2.\n\nNow I have 3 Jokers: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps.\nInterest becomes $2 per $5.\nIf I save up to $25, I get $10 interest per round.\n\nSo, the optimal play looks like \"The Hermit\" because it doesn't require targeting.\n\n\"The Hermit\" reads \"Doubles money (Max of $20)\". My money is $7. It will become $14.\nSo, I'm going to `select`.\n\nThe command is `select <pack_card_position>`.\nHermit is position 2. No targeting.\n\n`{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\nDoes \"The Star\" help more? I have 9 Diamonds currently.\nIf I use The Star on 3 cards, I'll have 12 Diamonds in deck.\n\nHowever, the economy from Hermit -> To the Moon -> Bootstraps is a very synergistic path.\n\nI check the shop:\n1.  Bootstraps ($7)\n2.  To the Moon ($5)\n3.  Tarot Merchant (Voucher - $10)\nTotal for all three = $22.\n\nI can't buy all three.\n\n\"Bootstraps\" right now is only +0. I need to hold the money. \"To the Moon\" helps me hold money. \"Four Fingers\" helps me win rounds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\"The Hermit\" is the best long-term play for this hand.\n\n`{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\nIs there any reason to *not* take \"The Hermit\"?\nThe Star makes flushes/straights easier.\nHierophant/Empress give flat bonuses.\n$7 extra early is basically 2-3 rounds of interest.\n\nI see \"7 of Spades. Description: +7 chips X1.5 Mult while this card stays in hand. Enhancement: Steel Card\" in my hand.\nI already have a Steel card. This is good for mult.\n\n**Decision:** Select \"The Hermit\".\n\n`{\"action\": \"\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
