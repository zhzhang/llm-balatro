{"reasoning":"**The Play: Incantation First**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm staring at a Mega Spectral Pack, and my immediate instinct is to grab Incantation.  The hand I've got is... mediocre.  Lots of low cards, nothing particularly exciting.  Incantation is the play right now because it gives me four enhanced cards *right away*, which will be a huge boost in the early game. With the \"Four Fingers\" joker I have, the more different cards, the better, so Incantation will really help me set a base for the mid-game.\n\nI have two choices to make.  Incantation is the best first pick because it's strong by itself, and its result will help me make a better second pick. So the first choice must be the \"Incantation\" card (4). After the first card is selected, I will select a second card from the remaining three.\n\nThe select command in Balatro is pretty simple; `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> ...`. This is a Spectral pack, which means I'll have to choose a second card at the next turn.\n\nIncantation looks pretty good because it *randomly* destroys a card. I don't need to specify which card. Okay, the command is simply `select 4`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
