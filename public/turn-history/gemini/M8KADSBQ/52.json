{"reasoning":"**Current Round Analysis and Action**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 3, $7 in the bank. The core strategy is clear: scale Vampire as quickly as possible. Four Fingers supports the flush strategy, so good card draws are anticipated.\n\nThe shop offers a few choices, but \"The Lovers\" is the key. For $3, I can enhance a card, feeding Vampire for a permanent +0.1x multiplier. That's crucial long-term growth.\n\nI need to decide: should I buy \"The Lovers\" or gamble on a Standard Pack? The Lovers is the guaranteed play. The pack is risky.\n\nMoney management is important with interest. With the current money, at $7, I get $2 interest due to \"To the Moon\". At $4, I'd earn $0 from interest. The Lovers is the correct move here. Losing $2 in potential interest next round is a small price to pay for the long-term Vampire scaling, which is the most important factor to succeed in Ante 3. The sooner I can start enhancing cards, the sooner Vampire's multiplier will start growing exponentially.\n\nI can't use `buy_and_use_consumable` with The Lovers because it targets a card in hand. The Lovers needs to go into my inventory for future use. The command is `buy_card 1`.\n\nSo, the optimal move is to buy the card. I will buy the card.\nAction: `buy_card 1`.\n\nLet me double-check. $7 - $3 = $4 remaining. I don't think there are any better actions. The current Joker order is optimal.\nBuy.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
