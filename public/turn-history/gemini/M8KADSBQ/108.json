{"reasoning":"**My Current Thought Process**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4, Round 11, and the Boss Blind is next. I'm in the SHOP phase with $47.\n\nLet's quickly recap: I have a solid joker setup: Four Fingers for Flushes/Straight Flushes, To the Moon for extra interest, Bootstraps for multiplicative bonus, Vampire for that sweet multiplier (which gains more for removing enhancements - although I need to make sure I don't lose useful enhancements), Zany Joker adding a flat multiplier on a 3-of-a-kind, and Business Card giving me a chance for extra cash. I'm rocking 6 joker slots total, and Zany doesn't take one because it's negative. I have one consumable, \"The Sun,\" and two vouchers: \"Clearance Sale\" and \"Hieroglyph.\" The shop is currently *empty*, and the reroll cost is $5.\n\nMy strategy is centered around Flushes and Straight Flushes, leaning heavily on Four Fingers and Vampire. With $47, To the Moon, I'll be earning $14 interest next round. Given the state of the shop, I'm already thinking about the Boss Blind and the looming threat of \"The Arm,\" which is going to reduce my hand levels. I'm especially concerned because my Straight Flush and Flush are only Level 2 each. I have $47. I want to look for Tarot or Planet packs. I *should* reroll. It's a common and efficient play.\n\nThe obvious play is to reroll the shop to hopefully get something useful, or if not at least to avoid wasting the money. My plan is reroll. I'm thinking of how I'd change the joker positions. But it can wait!\n\nBefore I reroll, I'm trying to decide if there's anything else I should do. Selling Jokers is not an option for now since they are all useful. Using the consumable \"The Sun\"? Not yet, it won't help Vampire as it does not add enhancements. Re-arranging Jokers? My current scoring order is Bootstraps, Vampire and Zany. The optimal scoring order is Additive Mult (Bootstraps, Zany) then Multiplicative Mult (Vampire), so Zany is before Vampire. I'll shuffle the order to be: 3 (Bootstraps), 5 (Zany), 4 (Vampire), but I'll do this after the shop phase.\n\nThe reroll will take the action, and then the round selector for the boss fight. The task is \"appropriate action to take next.\" I have $47, an empty shop, and a Boss coming up... The next step, then, is definitely to `reroll_shop`.\n\nSo, the action is `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
