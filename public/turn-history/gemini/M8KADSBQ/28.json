{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Tarot Pack: A Strategic Choice**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 2, Round 3, and I'm looking at an Arcana Pack after buying it. Money's at $8. I've got a decent Joker setup already: Four Fingers for flush/straight potential, To the Moon for interest, and Bootstraps building up my multiplier. I have three of my five Joker slots filled, and zero consumables used.\n\nThe pack choices are: The Hierophant (enhance 2 cards for +30 chips), Justice (enhance 1 card to a Glass Card - risky but powerful multiplier), and Judgement (a random Joker). This early in the run, I'm leaning heavily towards maximizing my Joker slots for the best tempo.\n\nJudgement looks like the best bet. Getting a random Joker is generally more valuable than card enhancements right now. I have space (3/5), so a new Joker could bring much-needed flat mult, chips, or economy. The Hierophant's +30 chips is good for scoring, but less impactful at this stage, and while Justice's Glass Card would be awesome later, I can't rely on it to carry a run this early, and the breaking chance is a drawback.\n\nSo, I'm going with Judgement (position 3 in the pack). I can just *select* it - no hand card targets needed. I'm checking the commands again... Yep, it's `select <pack_card_position>`. Judgement is position 3, I have plenty of room, and it doesn't cost anything that would impact my interest or Bootstraps. My current interest is 1 from To The Moon, and a further 1 from interest. The Bootstraps modifier currently adds +2 per $5 spent.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, I'm checking the positions list again. The JSON array should be `[3]`. Here's my intended selection:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [3],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nJudgement it is.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
