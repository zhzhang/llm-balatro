{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis for Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 8, Boss Blind coming up – time to maximize this score! We're flush (literally). Let's lay out the game state: $87, Flush at Level 7 (125 chips, 16 mult), and a solid Joker lineup. My core strategy hinges on Vampire (X3.9), boosted by Baseball Card (X1.5 for each Uncommon). Gotta crunch those numbers.\n\nRight now, I'm thinking:\n*   Vampire gives X3.9.\n*   Baseball Card will give X1.5 for each Uncommon. I have four: Bootstraps, To the Moon, Vampire, Marble Joker.\n*   That’s a total of 1.5^4 = 5.0625x boost from Baseball Card.\n*   Combined, that's almost 20x multiplier on whatever my base multiplier is.\n*   Bootstraps is adding +34 Mult, base Flush at 16, and Marble joker at 50 chips.\n*   If I just play a basic flush now, my calculation says 172,000 points.\n*   But hold on, \"Last Played Hands\" are scoring around 500k. Something is missing.\n\nCould be extra scoring cards, or, those cards may have had enhancements before Vampire ate them. Also, the order of Baseball Card triggers. I need to re-read that! Actually, Baseball Card: \"Uncommon Jokers each give X1.5 Mult.\" It is *each*.\n\nSo, it's (Base Mult + Additive Mult) * (1.5) * (1.5) * (Vampire X3.9) * (1.5) * (1.5)\nThe order is this: (16 base) + (34 Bootstraps) and the uncommon bonuses are: 1.5 (Bootstraps) * 1.5 (To the Moon) * 3.9 (Vampire) * 1.5 (Vampire's Trigger) * 1.5 (Marble Joker).\n\nIs the Baseball Card applying to itself? No, it is rare. Is there something adding chips, like card editions? Still, the scaling is clear: Level Flush and get Vampire more food.\n\nNow, Jupiter is in the shop for $1. This is a no-brainer: immediate buy and use to level up Flush (+2 Mult, +15 Chips). Done. Now, should I check Odd Todd? +31 chips on odd cards? I have six slots; Marble Joker is already providing chips, and I'd rather save the slot for impact or rerolls. But let's check the money: $87. I want to stay above $80 to keep options open.\n\nIs there any reason *not* to buy Jupiter? No. Buy and use.\n\nSo that takes care of the immediate, necessary step. I'm now at $86. Now should I reroll?\n\nHere's my analysis:\n1.  Buy and use Jupiter.\n2.  Assess Odd Todd. It's only $2. It's a decent chip source if I have an empty slot. But it's Common.\n3.  Reroll again? Or move to Round Select?\n4.  Wait, \"Hallucination\" triggers when a *Booster Pack* is opened. I already opened the pack and used Jupiter. Jupiter is now a shop card. Using Jupiter from the shop won't trigger Hallucination.\n\nMy action: `buy_and_use_consumable 1`\n\nAnte 8, Round 22. This is the Big Blind? No, the metadata says the last hand was Big Blind. The state doesn't say if I'm at the Boss Blind or Small Blind of a new Ante, but looking at Ante: 8/8, and Round: 22... Small (20), Big (21), Boss (22).\n\nRound 22. If the last played hand was Big Blind (Ante 8), then I am now selecting the Boss Blind (Ante 8). Wait, \"Last Played Hands\" says Flush 470k (Ante 8, Big Blind). So the next blind is the Boss Blind. This is the final boss of the run (unless playing Endless).\n\nI need to maximize score *now*. Buy Jupiter. It's a permanent upgrade.\n\nJupiter first, Odd Todd after?\n$87 current, reroll cost $6. Buy Jupiter first. `buy_and_use_consumable` is for cards in the Shop Cards section that are consumables. Jupiter is Shop Card 1.\n\nWait\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
