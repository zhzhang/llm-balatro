{"reasoning":"**Balatro Analysis: Ante 8, Skipping the Pack**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 8, Round 20, the final ante. The game step is BUFFOON_PACK, specifically a Mega Buffoon Pack. My goal is to choose two of the four available Jokers, but I have a full hand of 8 Jokers already.\n\nLet's do a quick rundown of what I'm working with. I've got Zany Joker (which is negative but provides +12 mult for 3-of-a-kind), Bootstraps (+2 Mult per $5, which is quite substantial), Four Fingers (essential for flushes and straights, which is my focus), To the Moon (a negative that boosts interest), Seltzer (retriggers cards, a powerful effect given I have only 4 hands left), Vampire (a strong x3.5 mult), Baseball Card (rare, a key piece of this build as it multiplies Uncommon Jokers), and Hallucination (a negative with a chance for a Tarot card). I am at the Joker capacity limit; I have 8 Jokers and the maximum is 8.\n\nThe pack offers Red Card (+3 Mult on pack skip), Egg (+$3 sell value), Banner (+30 chips per discard), and Even Steven (+4 Mult for even ranks). Initially, I tried to select Egg, which failed. The game's error message, \"Cannot select this pack card,\" indicates that the Joker inventory is full.\n\nThe \"Max Jokers: 8\" line is telling me that I am at the limit. I then need to consider the \"Secondary Description: +1 Joker slot\" provided on Negative Jokers. This means the negative trait itself is the implementation here that means I have one open slot for each negative joker. In other words, Negative Jokers do not count against my inventory limit, effectively increasing my capacity. Let's count how many non-negative jokers I have: Bootstraps, Four Fingers, Seltzer, Vampire, and Baseball Card for a total of 5. With 3 negative Jokers, I have 8/8.\n\nI can't add any new Jokers until I sell one to free up space. Let's weigh my current Jokers against the pack options. Red Card does nothing if I cannot claim it. Egg, Banner, and Even Steven are all common, but none of these even remotely approach the value of what I currently have, especially given my Uncommon-focused build with Baseball Card. So, selling a Joker is not an option.\n\nThe logical choice here is to skip the Mega Buffoon Pack, despite the tempting +3 Mult on pack skip because I don't own the Red Card. Even if I sold Zany to free up a spot, it would make my Joker limit worse and offer no clear advantage. I have no incentive to swap any of my current Jokers for the pack options, as my focus is on Uncommon Jokers and a build around Baseball Card.\n\nTherefore, the only valid course of action is to `skip_booster`. The previous attempt to select was `select 2`, which failed.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
