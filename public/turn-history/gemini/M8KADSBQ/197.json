{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Ante 7, Round 18**\n\nOkay, Ante 7, Round 18. Small blind (35,000) is easy, but the Big blind (52,500) and Boss (70,000) are coming up. I have $54. My inventory is looking pretty solid: Zany Joker, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer (6 hands), Vampire (X3.3), and Baseball Card. I've also got Justice and The Tower. Seven Jokers slots full. Two consumables left.\n\nThe \"Negative Tag\" is active: the next base edition Joker is free and negative. That's a huge opportunity. With \"To the Moon\" my interest will be ~$10. Playing gets me ~$23 ($3 + $10). I need to think about this carefully. Vampire is my key scaling joker.\n\nI know I can probably win the blind, but this \"Negative Tag\" is a potential game-changer. Usually, I'd go for it. A free, non-slot-taking negative Joker is rare.\n\nWait, if I play, I get $23 and the opportunity to use Justice and The Tower on Vampire. Seltzer is ticking down, which is a consideration. But I also get to use Baseball Card which is a huge multi. Let's see... Baseball Card gives 1.5x *per* uncommon, so that's a massive multiplier: X7.59. With Vampire, that's X25.04. Plus additive mult. I am definitely strong enough to pass the blind.\n\nSo, I can play and scale Vampire, or skip and get a \"Negative Tag.\" The Tag will essentially add a joker, and my current build is already winning easily. Seltzer hands, also. Okay, the decision is to skip for the \"Negative Tag.\"\n\nWait, let me double-check. The Negative Tag makes the next Joker free *and* negative. This is good. I need to think about the order of jokers.\n\nCurrent: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card.\n\nI should check the Baseball Card's interaction: I need all the uncommon jokers placed after all additive mult jokers, for max effect.\nIt is:\n- Zany (+12 Common) - Additive\n- Bootstraps (+22 Uncommon) - Additive\n- Four Fingers (Uncommon) - Utility\n- To the Moon (Uncommon) - Utility\n- Seltzer (Uncommon) - Utility\n- Vampire (Uncommon) - X-Mult\n- Baseball Card (Rare)\n\nThis is correct. All additive mult should be leftmost. The utility and X-mult jokers after, and then the Baseball Card (X1.5 per uncommon joker). Zany should be first, it is, because it's additive. Bootstraps should be after Zany. The order is perfect.\n\nSo, the play is still to skip.\n\nOne last check: Boss is \"The Window\" (diamonds debuffed). I'm running a flush build, but with four fingers and vampire, I should be fine to work around that. Justice and The Tower, if I need them, are ready for the Big Blind.\n\nLet's skip for the tag.\n\nI need to confirm the \"skip\" action is correct: `{\"action\": \"skip_round\"}`. This is good.\n\nWait, looking at vouchers, I see \"Hieroglyph\". That's why I'm in Ante 7 despite playing 18 rounds.\n\nIs there any reason *not* to skip? A Negative Joker is usually worth way more than $13. Even a bad one is a free joker.\n\nOne thing: skipping means I skip the shop *now*. I go straight to the Big Blind, then the Shop. The Negative Tag will apply to the first joker in that shop.\n\nYep, the \"Negative Tag\" is too valuable to pass up.\n\n**Action: `skip_round`.**\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
