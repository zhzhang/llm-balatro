{"reasoning":"**Card Selection Strategy for Maximum Vampire Synergy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in a `STANDARD_PACK` phase. My primary objective is to select the most impactful card from this pack to bolster my deck, specifically synergizing with my Jokers. Let's break it down. I've got a strong core setup, focusing on a few key Jokers: `Four Fingers`, which is great for Flushes and Straights; `To the Moon`, adding a solid interest income; `Bootstraps`, constantly scaling up my multiplier; and, critically, `Vampire`, my main multiplier engine. `Vampire` gains additional multiplier from playing Enhanced cards, but then it removes the Enhancement. I've also got `Zany Joker`, a potential multi-boost if I can manage 3 of a kind, but I don't see that as key right now. My inventory currently holds `The Sun`, that I can convert to hearts.\n\nNow, looking at the pack choices, I see three options: a 3 of Hearts, a 2 of Clubs, and a 9 of Clubs with a Mult Enhancement. Neither the 3 of Hearts nor the 2 of Clubs presents any immediate benefit to `Vampire`, and my other Jokers don't particularly favor these options. However, the 9 of Clubs with Mult Enhancement is a completely different story. Playing this `Enhanced Card` will directly fuel `Vampire`, increasing its multiplier by X0.1.\n\nMy core strategy is centered around scaling `Vampire` to maximize my overall multiplier. This is the only card in the pack that directly helps to enhance Vampire. Therefore, the 9 of Clubs (Mult Enhancement) is the clear winner here. I'm going to **select** that card. This does not require any additional hand targets.\n\nMy command is: `select 3`.\nThe JSON response will be: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
