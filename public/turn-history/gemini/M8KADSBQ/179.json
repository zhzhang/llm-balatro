{"reasoning":"**The Strategy Unfolds**\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. I'm at Ante 6, Round 17. Got $65 in the bank. Need to win, get to Ante 8. My current build is pretty solid: Flush Level 5, Crafty Joker, Four Fingers, Bootstraps (+26 Mult), Zany (potentially a free +12 Mult with Flushes), Vampire (X3.3 Mult that scales via enhancements), and Seltzer (retriggers all cards). The immediate shop has nothing useful. Reroll cost is $6, I've already rerolled once this shop.\n\nRight now, the plan is to scale Vampire, keep interest up for Bootstraps, and max out my Flush potential. The shop is empty – no boosters, no vouchers I need. I'm thinking, rerolling seems sensible given I have $65.\n\nI’m weighing the options here. I need to scale Vampire. I have to find Planet cards (Jupiter) or Tarot cards (to enhance cards for Vampire). Currently I can buy the 8 Ball or the Wrathful Joker, but I don't want either. The shop cards are Jokers (8 Ball, Wrathful). I can't buy them without selling. I need to find something that helps my scaling.\n\nI've got \"To the Moon\" so interest is effectively double. Standard interest is $1 per $5, max $5. \"To the Moon\" makes it $2 per $5. I currently have $65, and that gives me $26 interest. I could keep going, but interest is capped at $5, or $10 with the \"To the Moon\" joker (or more if I get \"Seed Money\"). I have a lot of money, too much, really.\n\nI was thinking a reroll, but the shop cards are useless. I already know this since I have 7/7 Jokers and the shop is offering Jokers. I need packs.\n\nI'm thinking, I could go for another reroll ($6), which keeps Bootstraps at a high level. But the shop is empty. The current shop sucks.\n\nI know I *should* be hunting for Jupiters or Tarot cards, so another reroll is justified. The previous action was `reroll_shop`, the shop has changed from (4 of Clubs, Superposition) to (8 Ball, Wrathful Joker). I'm thinking, if I don't see anything useful this reroll, I move on.\n\n*Wait*, I see the shop has `Shop Boosters: None`. So a reroll is required to get a booster.\n\nOkay, let's step back a bit. I have a strong build and I'm very close to the Boss Blind. The Last Played Hands are around 25k (per Flush), which should be enough. Let me double check that Zany Joker. Yes, a Flush can contain a Three of a Kind. Easy. I need a lot of damage to beat the boss.\n\n*Seltzer* is *huge* for Vampire. Seltzer doubles Vampire's scaling rate! This makes it even more important to find enhanced cards. Finding Tarot cards to enhance cards is now *priority #1*. Rerolling to find a Tarot pack is better than saving $6.\n\nOkay, I'm rerolling.\n\n*Action: `reroll_shop`*\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
