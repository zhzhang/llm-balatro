{"reasoning":"**The Calculated Skip**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 3, Round 5, $4 in the bank. I've got a solid Joker setup: Four Fingers for flushes/straights, To the Moon for interest, Bootstraps for multiplier boost, and the key Vampire for scaling. I also have \"The Lovers,\" a consumable that could significantly juice Vampire. The current blind is the Small Blind (2000 chips).\n\nMy immediate choices are clear: play the round for ~$7-8 (base reward, hands remaining, and interest) or skip for the Handy Tag reward of $11. I have to think about the long game with Vampire. The Lovers would give the multiplier of vampire a boost, but can that be done in the big blind?\n\n*   If I *play*, I'm looking at $3 base, plus a couple of dollars for the hands remaining, maybe $5-6 total. Then, the interest at the end of the round. Plus the opportunity to use \"The Lovers\". With the $4 right now, if I win and end with $9, I get $2 interest.\n\n*   If I *skip*, I grab the Handy Tag and get $11, boosting my total to $15. No immediate interest. But skipping doesn't end a round, so I don't get a shop, but also, no shop right now.\n\nThe *real* benefit of the $11 is the immediate power-up: It jumps me to $15, which makes Bootstraps much better (+6 Mult) and sets the stage for solid \"To the Moon\" interest in the Big Blind. Also, \"The Lovers\" *has* to be used during a round or in the shop, so skipping doesn't take that opportunity away. I can still use \"The Lovers\" in the Big Blind or Boss Blind.\n\nSkipping also means I'll be going into the Big Blind next (3000 chips), but I should be able to get a strong play in there. The Boss Blind will be \"The Eye\" which forces a one-hand play.\n\nConsidering the immediate cash, $11, this is a clear decision. The $11 from the Handy Tag is a much safer, more immediate reward than fighting the Small Blind (2000 chips). Yes, I miss a shop, but the $11 jump-starts my economy with Bootstraps and interest. **Action: skip\\_round**\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
