{"reasoning":"**Analysis of a High-Stakes Blind Select**\n\nOkay, so I'm staring down Round 14, a Blind Select boss fight with a significant chip requirement: 22,000.  The Club is in play, meaning any Clubs in my hand are debuffed, though thankfully, they still contribute to hand formation. My starting bankroll is meager at $70, but my Joker setup is strong, leaning heavily into a Flush build, which unfortunately is very vulnerable here. I have a *Crafty Joker* to buff Flush chips, *Four Fingers* for flush/straight utility, a crippling *To the Moon*, *Bootstraps* for Multiplier stacking, a *Zany Joker*, and a *Vampire* for Multiplier scaling. The hand levels are decent, with Flush at level 3, 3OAK at level 3.\n\nThe immediate problem is the debuffed Clubs. This impacts my Flush strategy, and the card chip impact is something that I need to mitigate. It means that to ensure the highest score for my Flush, the Clubs need to be kept out of the flush. The primary focus of this round is to execute a Flush play and maximize each point of potential.\n\nMy game plan is simple: I'll start the round, after verifying the Joker order to score the best possible hand. I don't need to sell anything or use any consumables. The order is optimized: *Crafty* for the initial chip boost, *Four Fingers* and *To the Moon* for utility, *Bootstraps* for additive Multiplier, then *Zany* for additional 3OAK Multiplier, and finally *Vampire* to maximize my score with its multiplicative effect.\n\nLet's do some quick math on an ideal hand. Playing a non-Club Flush, I expect roughly 170 chips (65 base + ~25 card chips + 80 from *Crafty*). My Multiplier should be about 36 (8 base + 28 from *Bootstraps*), which *Vampire* will multiply by 3.1, for an additional 111.6 Multiplier. This yields a total score of approximately 18,972 chips – very close to the target.\n\nI can't manipulate my hand this round. The only logical action is to \"play_round.\" This is a critical round.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
