{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Strategy - Flush/Mult Focus**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop after beating Ante 4. Let's see... I have $48. \"To the Moon\" gives me a nice interest boost, $2 per $5, so I want to keep my money above $45 ideally for that and Bootstraps, which is currently at +18 Mult per $5. I'm running a Flush-focused deck (Level 2 Flushes). My core strategy is built around Bootstraps and Vampire for Mult.\n\nI need to make the most of this shop. First, the crucial Liquidation Voucher is a steal at $7, especially because I already have Clearance Sale active, which makes everything even *cheaper*. So that's priority #1.\n\nNext, the Jumbo Spectral Pack for $4 is a great deal! Spectral cards can be game-changers - think Ankh, Hex, etc. And finally, the Celestial Pack for $3 is cheap and helpful.\n\nThen there's The Devil for $2. Vampire *loves* enhancements, but it eats them when they *score*. So, I need to use it on a card in my deck, in the next round. *But I can't buy The Devil unless I have cards in hand.* I'm in the Shop, there's no hand to use it on. Tarot cards are stored in the consumable slots.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Buy Liquidation** to get the 50% discount. That's a must-buy.\n2.  **Buy Jumbo Spectral Pack**.\n3.  **Buy Celestial Pack**.\n4.  **Buy The Devil**.\n\nLet's do the math: $48 - $7 (Liquidation) = $41. $41 - $4 (Spectral) = $37. $37 - $3 (Celestial) = $34. $34 - $2 (The Devil) = $32.\n\nOkay, let's see, I need to do this in order to maximize the effects of Liquidation.\n\nShould I sell a Joker for the Green Joker? No, Green Joker is not good now.\n\nLet's get this JSON command out.\n\nLet's run `buy_voucher 1`.\nI'm going to buy the Voucher first.\nI don't need to rearrange my Jokers. I like their order for now.\nThe Spectral pack is already very cheap, so let's buy the Voucher first.\nLet's make sure I have space for consumables (I do).\n\nOkay, one last look at the command. Okay, now JSON Output time.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
