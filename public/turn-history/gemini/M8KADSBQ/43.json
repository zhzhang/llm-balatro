{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Navigating The Pillar**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 2, Round 4. The Big Blind is down, and the Boss Blind, \"The Pillar\", is looming. I've got $5, and the shop is... not ideal. Let's break this down.\n\nMy core strategy revolves around economy, using the interest from To the Moon to fuel Bootstraps. Currently, I'm at the crucial $5 mark, earning a $2 interest boost and a +2 Mult from Bootstraps. My joker suite is decent: Four Fingers for Straight Flushes, Vampire for scaling with enhancements, and Bootstraps, which is crucial for early scaling.\n\nThe Shop has Neptune, which upgrades my Straight Flush, and a Green Joker. Neptune would cost $3, and Green Joker is $4. Rerolling is not an option as it costs all my money.\n\n\"The Pillar\" Boss Blind is the major concern. It debuffs cards played *this Ante*. I've been heavily leaning on Flushes – that's the issue. With Vampire, though, I could potentially mitigate the effects by removing enhancements, though that doesn't save the cards from being debuffed.\n\nIf I buy Neptune or the Green Joker, I'll drop below the $5 threshold. Losing the interest and the Bootstrap mult would be a huge setback, especially given that the shop options are not particularly strong. Neptune gives me a potential Level 2 Straight Flush, but I have to weigh the opportunity cost.\n\nThe Green Joker is alright, but not vital. I have decent mult from Bootstraps and Vampire. I've been playing mostly flushes but the effects of the Pillar might be limited, as it might consider the *base* card (debuffed) in hand evaluation. I'm prioritizing economy. The $2 interest, and the +2 from Bootstraps are crucial. I'm going to keep my money and save.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed directly to the Boss Blind. The reasoning is clear: Preserve my economy and the Bootstraps Mult. I need raw mult now.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
