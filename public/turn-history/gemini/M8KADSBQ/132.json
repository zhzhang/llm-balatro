{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: Immolate is the Play**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `SPECTRAL_PACK` phase. I've got $47, and a solid joker setup: Crafty Joker for flush chips, Four Fingers boosting flushes, Bootstraps for money mult, Vampire for card-specific X-mult, and the negative Jokers, To the Moon and Zany, giving me extra slots. With the extra slots provided by the negative Jokers, I have 7 total joker slots, and one free slot.\n\nLooking at the options, Ankh is a hard no – destroying my current jokers, especially with the negative ones, would be a disaster. Ouija is also a pass due to the hand size reduction, even though it could help with getting a single rank. That leaves Aura and Immolate. Aura is tempting; it offers a chance at Polychrome (X1.5 mult), but Vampire removes enhancements, so editions are the only benefit here. Immolate, on the other hand, gives me an immediate $20, increasing my Bootstraps multiplier significantly, and thinning the deck, which should help with the density of my high value cards.\n\nMy hand at the moment is: 7S, 6S, 9H, 8H, 4C, 2C, QD. There are no cards I'm desperate to keep that I can't live without. The $20 from Immolate immediately boosts my Bootstraps multiplier from +18 to +26, and also improves my interest with To the Moon, which I have to double check: To the Moon says \"extra $1 for every $5.\" With $67 I'll get $18 interest, and with the new multiplier, and a higher interest base, that's significant. The $20 doesn't help Vampire directly, but more money allows buying future Tarot packs to get enhancements for Vampire. And of course, the general deck thinning that comes with Immolate is a generally positive move in Balatro.\n\nAura can be good if it hits Polychrome, but there's a 1/3 chance of that. Immolate's value is guaranteed. And looking at the total picture, Immolate is the most numerically significant, and safest choice. So, to make that happen: `select 4`. Let's do it!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
