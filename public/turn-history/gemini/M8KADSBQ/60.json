{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Analysis: Prioritizing Long-Term Scaling**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. I'm at Ante 2, which is great because it gives me a bit more breathing room. My current money is $15, which nets me $6 in interest thanks to \"To the Moon.\" My jokers are a solid start: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire. I also have The Magician consumable, and the Hieroglyph voucher.\n\nMy primary focus is maximizing Vampire's x-multiplier. The key to Vampire's growth lies in enhanced cards. While Lusty Joker offers a decent additive bonus for Hearts, I have Bootstraps and a more lucrative scaling strategy.\n\nInitially, I considered buying Standard Packs to hopefully find enhanced cards for Vampire. However, after some reflection and correction (I need Arcana or Spectral packs, not Standard for Vampire), I realized that the odds of finding those valuable enhanced cards are low. Standard Packs are a gamble that, at this stage, isn't worth taking.\n\nI have an \"open\" 5th joker slot. Lusty Joker (+3 Mult for Hearts) is only a temporary option. If I play 5 hearts, that's +15 mult. 15 - 2 (loss from Bootstraps) = +13 net mult. It's not bad, but I can do better.\n\nMore importantly, Hieroglyph lowered the Ante, so I'm safe to play conservatively. I’ll make more money with a conservative strategy.\n\nSince Vampire is my primary scaling engine, my long-term goal is to maximize my interest and Bootstraps scaling. I need to keep my money high. Spending $4 on a Standard Pack would be counterproductive, as I already have a scaling engine (Vampire) that needs better food (Arcana/Spectral packs, which are currently not available).\n\nAt the end of the next round with $15, I would net $6 interest, $2 hands, and $2 round reward. That would bring me to $25. This maximizes my interest to $10 and Bootstraps to +10 mult. This would create a much stronger position for future rounds.\n\nTherefore, the most disciplined and strategically sound play is to choose `round_select` to maximize my interest and Bootstraps. This gives me a significant advantage in the long run. I will pass on buying anything from the shop, and play the next round for profit.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
