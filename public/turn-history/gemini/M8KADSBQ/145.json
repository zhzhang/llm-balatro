{"reasoning":"**My Current Game State Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 5/8, Round 14. I'm in the SHOP. I've got $70. Let's see, my Jokers are: Crafty Joker (that Flush chip boost is nice), Four Fingers (essential for flushes and straights), To the Moon (that potential interest is intriguing, but a negative), Bootstraps (loving that mult boost from cash), Zany Joker (3OAK boost!), and Vampire (the real powerhouse with that multiplier). I have a max of 7 joker slots and I currently have 6 jokers.\n\nMy hand levels are pretty solid: Flush Level 3, 3 of a Kind Level 3, and Straight Flush Level 3.\n\nIn the shop, I see a Flash Card that gains mult per reroll for $2, and rerolls cost $5. With my current $70, this is a wash. I lose $2 mult from Bootstraps per reroll, but gain $2 mult from the Flash Card. I'm not sure this is worth the effort unless I start focusing on the Flash Card.\n\nMy main strategies are: flush-focused with Crafty and Four Fingers, 3 of a Kind with Zany, and scaling with Vampire (which needs enhanced cards) and Bootstraps (which needs money).\n\nThe Flash Card isn't a good deal because it nets zero mult. Rerolling could potentially get me Tarot or Planet cards for Vampire, but spending money is a no-go at this stage.\n\nI'm thinking I should probably move to the next blind.\n\nNow, let's talk about the money. I've got $70. To the Moon is the wildcard. Normally, I would make $5 interest, but To the Moon adds $1 per $5 at the end of the round. So, normally, I would make $5, but now I think I'm making $14. That's a lot.\n\nBootstraps is at +28 Mult currently. I want to keep it there.\n\nThe shop offers nothing valuable at the moment. Flash Card is a trap. I have no need for any cards, boosters, or vouchers.\n\nI should definitely go to the round select screen.\n\nFirst, I should check my Joker order: Crafty, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany, and Vampire. Chips, utility, interest/negative, add mult, add mult, multiply mult. The order is right, with Chips, Additive Mult, and Multiplicative Mult order.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\nBut wait, hold on... let's re-examine that interest with To the Moon. The wording is \"Earn an extra $1 of interest for every $5 you have at end of round.\" I think that means I get double interest, and with my $70, that's $14.\n\nI don't need Flash Card. I'll save my money for interest and Bootstraps.\n\nCommand: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
