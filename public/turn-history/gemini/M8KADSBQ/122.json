{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis: Round 12 - Time for Some Strategic Spending**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: Round 12, ante 5/8. I've got $38 – a decent starting point. My Jokers are a solid mix: Crafty Joker for chip generation on flushes, Four Fingers for hand flexibility, \"To the Moon\" for boosted interest (which is huge right now!), Bootstraps and Zany for multiplicative and additive Mult, and Vampire, which is my main multiplier, but needs feeding. I also have the Strength consumable.\n\nThe shop offers some interesting choices: a Green Joker (I'll pass on that), The Devil (very tempting!), and a Celestial Pack ($2).\n\nMy immediate thought is to maximize my current financial advantage. \"To the Moon\" is giving me double interest – a full $14 per round with my current money. That's a huge boost. I need to keep that money high.\n\nThe Devil is interesting because it can feed Vampire with enhancements. So, I think I need to acquire \"The Devil\". Celestial Packs can offer Jupiter (Flush), which would be amazing.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1.  **Buy the Celestial Pack ($2):** Hoping for a good planet card like Jupiter to boost my Flush. This costs $2.\n2.  **Buy The Devil ($1):** Store it as a consumable in my empty slot. I'll use it to enhance a card next round. That feeds Vampire for a nice multiplier boost.\n\nI double-checked: I can't *use* The Devil in the shop. I must buy it to store it. So, I will get rid of $38.\n\nLet's break down my resources:\nI have 6/7 Joker slots filled. I have 1/2 consumable slots filled. This is perfect.\nMy money is $38.\n\nAction: `buy_booster 1`, then `buy_card 2` to obtain The Devil.\n\nThe Celestial Pack: It's a no-brainer. I'll get that first.\n\nAnd yes, I checked my Joker order. All good. Vampire is at the end, correctly multiplying the sum of all bonuses.\n\nAlright, time to execute:\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
