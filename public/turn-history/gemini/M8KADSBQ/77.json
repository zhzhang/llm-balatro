{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: Round 8 Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of where I'm at. Ante 3/8, Round 8. I've got $26 in the bank. My Joker lineup is Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire. I've got one Joker slot open. My main hand is a Flush at Level 2, so it has 50 Chips and 6 Mult. I also have the Hieroglyph voucher, which is helping me out (-1 Ante, -1 hand).\n\nI've got a few options in the shop: Juggler (adds +1 hand size) for $4, a Standard Pack for $4, and a Director's Cut voucher for $10. Rerolling the shop costs $5.\n\nLet's think this through. My Jokers are all pretty solid. Four Fingers is key for my Flush strategy, and To the Moon is cranking up my interest, now at double the rate. Bootstraps is giving me +10 Mult, which is really nice, and Vampire is giving me x2 Mult and the potential for even more multiplier as I play enhanced cards.\n\nMy main focus right now is to maximize my money. Right now I have 26 dollars, so I will be earning 10 dollars in interest. The goal is to stay above $25 to keep both the interest rate and Bootstraps maximum.\n\n*   **Juggler:** While an extra card in hand is helpful, it's not worth the $4 and the Joker slot at the moment. It may block a better Joker later in the game.\n*   **Standard Pack:** It's just too expensive for a random card. No thanks.\n*   **Reroll:** $5 is a bit steep given my current bank balance and the fact that I'm already pretty satisfied with my hand. Rerolling would leave me with $21.\n\nI bought a Planet card and used a Booster in the last shop. The current shop items don't look appealing.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best play here is to advance to the next round. This will allow me to build up more cash, which will increase both my interest and Bootstraps Mult, and also give me more opportunities to find better Jokers or Tarots in the next shop.\n\nI should double-check my Joker order to ensure I'm getting the most out of them. Scoring order is Played cards > Bootstraps (+ Mult) > Vampire (x Mult). Currently, I have them in the correct order: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire.\n\n**Final Action:** `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
