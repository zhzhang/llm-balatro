{"reasoning":"**Decision: Spectral Pack - Familiar**\n\nOkay, Ante 3, Round 7, SHOP phase. Let's see... I've got $22, four Jokers (Four Fingers for flushes/straights, To the Moon for interest, Bootstraps with a nice +8 Mult, and my core, the Vampire), and the goal is clear: maximize Vampire's multiplier. It's all about feeding that thing. I've got a decent hand, but I need to optimize.\n\nThe Spectral Pack choices are: Familiar (destroy one random card, add 3 random Enhanced face cards) and Grim (destroy one random card, add 2 random Enhanced Aces).  Hmm, both involve card destruction, which is a bit risky with that Gold 10, but the payoff for Vampire is huge. Vampire grows by +0.1x per enhanced card.\n\nFamiliar gives 3 enhanced cards, Grim gives 2. It's simple math: 3 is better than 2 in this situation. 3 Enhanced cards means +0.3 to the Vampire, 2 is only +0.2. It's a no-brainer with Vampire in play.\n\n\"Familiar\" is in position 1. So, the command is `select 1`. Let's confirm that this is a valid action; I don't need any additional hand positions, because the pack is random.\n\nAlright, double-checking the command list to be sure. It states that I can optionally add hand position. But this is random.\n\nOkay, let's refine the JSON: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`. Perfect. The Vampire is going to feast.\n\nLet's double check Vampire's mechanics once more: \"Vampire gains X0.1 Mult per scoring Enhanced card played, removes card Enhancement\". This confirms my thinking.\n\nFinal checks: four Jokers is good. Zero consumables is space for new ones.\n\nGot it. The logical choice is \"Familiar\". Now, let's produce the JSON.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
