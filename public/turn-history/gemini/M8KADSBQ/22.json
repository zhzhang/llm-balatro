{"reasoning":"**My Strategy: Grind for Capital**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 2, with the Ante at 2/8. I've got $2, and the game step is BLIND_SELECT. My Jokers are Four Fingers, To the Moon, and Bootstraps. The immediate goal is the Small Blind (800 chips). The Big Blind is 1200 chips after that. And the Boss Blind lurks at 1600 chips, which I don't need to consider right now.\n\nMy core strategy hinges on getting \"Bootstraps\" and \"To the Moon\" online. Right now, both are doing nothing. \"Bootstraps\" needs $5 increments for its multiplier, and \"To the Moon\" needs $5 increments for interest. I only have $2, so these Jokers are sleeping giants.\n\nThe decision is: skip the round for a Voucher Tag (adds a voucher to the next shop) or play the Small Blind? Skipping isn't an option. Vouchers are likely to cost $10, and even a great Voucher is useless if I can't afford it. Skipping also means missing out on the $3 round reward.\n\nPlaying the round is the *only* way to get started. I need cash. I expect to get at least $3 for winning the round, plus maybe $1 for a hand bonus. That puts me at around $6. That will net me $2 interest with \"To the Moon.\" With $8, I’m getting somewhere. More importantly, playing the round gives me a chance to build up my money so I can use my Jokers.\n\n\"Four Fingers\" is a real blessing here. It makes it easier to hit flushes and straights, which means I can reach the Small Blind even without any multiplier from \"Bootstraps\". I need to be aiming for those hands to generate money.\n\nSo, the action is `play_round`. The reasoning is simple: I need to generate capital. Skipping is a dead end. Playing the round is the only way forward.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
