{"reasoning":"**Shop Analysis and Decision: Moving to the Next Round**\n\nAlright, let's break down this shop phase. Ante is 6/8, round 15, and I'm in the shop with $61. My current Joker setup is pretty solid: Crafty for those sweet Flush chips, Four Fingers to handle flushes and straights, To the Moon giving me extra interest (a nice boost with my bankroll), Bootstraps adding +2 Mult per $5 (currently at +24), Zany if I happen to hit a 3 of a Kind, Vampire for that juicy X3.2 multiplier, and Seltzer, to replay the hand. I have the maximum number of Jokers at 7/7, which is good.\n\nIn the shop, I'm staring at Crazy Joker which adds Mult on a Straight, a bit irrelevant, and Odd Todd which offers chips on odd ranks. The vouchers available is Magic Trick, which would let me buy a card from the shop.\n\nMy main strategy is Flushes, leveraging Crafty and Four Fingers, with Vampire as the scaling powerhouse. Bootstraps and Zany provide additional mult, and the goal is to enhance cards using packs to feed Vampire.\n\nI'm eyeing this shop, and these cards aren't helping. I'm looking for packs, ideally Tarot or Spectral, to give Vampire something to chomp on. I don't need Crazy Joker because my deck isn't built for Straights right now, and Odd Todd is weak compared to Crafty. I have no need for Magic Trick.\n\nThe reroll cost is now $8, and with $61 in the bank, my interest is good right now thanks to the To The Moon Joker, and I've already rerolled twice. The shop information consistently says \"Shop Boosters: None\", which means I either bought them (unlikely) or they're not spawning (also unlikely).\n\nThe shop is starting to look stale. Rerolling at $8 is a diminishing return. I've spent several turns rerolling, so I need to move on, increase the bankroll, and hopefully get a better selection. Bootstraps is giving me +24 already, so the interest is good.\n\nMy action will be `round_select`. I've already confirmed there's nothing I want in the shop. I should take a quick look to make sure. I'm not seeing anything that's worth my time. `Magic Trick` for $5 isn't worth it. I don't want to get rid of Crafty and swap it for `Odd Todd`.\n\nI confirm I have made a decision to move to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
