{"reasoning":"**My Balatro Shop Strategy: Hold Steady**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop. Ante 2, Round 3, with $5. My primary goal here is to optimize for the long game. I've got a solid Joker setup: \"Four Fingers\" (flushes/straights), \"To the Moon\" (interest!), \"Bootstraps\" (mult!), and \"Vampire\" (scaling). My immediate concern is maximizing my economy.\n\nI'm holding \"The Tower\" consumable for now – can't use it in the Shop; Balatro rules. I'll need to save it for next round. My interest is $2, thanks to \"To the Moon\" which provides a nice boost. And \"Bootstraps\" gives me +2 Mult.\n\nI've got a few choices but they're not great right now. Spending any money drops my interest to zero and erases my Bootstraps mult. I considered \"Raised Fist\", but it's not worth it right now. It is a good Joker, but not *right now*. I looked at the Arcana Pack, but with a good economic setup, random effects are not as enticing. And I definitely *can't* afford the Tarot Merchant.\n\nI'm going to stick with the $5. It's a key amount for maximum interest and \"Bootstraps\" scaling. I’ll keep \"The Tower\" to feed the \"Vampire\". Since I can't do anything else, the best action is `round_select` to move to the next blind. I don't need to rearrange my Jokers either.\n\nI re-checked if I *could* do anything else, but my inventory is what it is, and the `use_consumable` command requires that I target cards in my hand (which I can't see right now). `round_select` it is.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
