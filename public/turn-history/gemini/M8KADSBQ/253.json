{"reasoning":"**Deep in the Numbers: Round 22 Reroll**\n\nOkay, Boss Blind's looming, and I need to solidify my strategy. I'm sitting on $86, a Flush level of 8, and a solid Joker lineup: *Bootstraps* (that juicy +34 Multi), the negative but potentially useful *To the Moon*, my primary carry the *Vampire* (X3.9 Multi), the *Baseball Card* (the key!), the useless *Hallucination* (ugh), and the *Marble Joker* (+50 Chips). I'm capped at 7 Jokers, currently holding 6.\n\nMy core plan revolves around maximizing Flushes and leaning hard on the *Vampire*, amplified by the *Baseball Card*. I see *Odd Todd* in the shop, but at a mere $2. The potential +31 Chips on odd ranks is tempting, *but* he's common, which means *no* Baseball Card synergy. My intuition screams \"no\" here. The shop price of $2 doesn't matter as it will go away with a reroll and even if I don't reroll, it's cheap to simply skip. It is better to have an open slot for something I could find.\n\nI'm pondering the interest calculation. I'm pretty sure interest is capped, especially if I don't have a voucher.  At $86, I should be earning $17 by *To the Moon*, but if interest caps at $5, anything beyond $25 is fair game for spending. With a $6 reroll cost, I have to assume the maximum value (theoretically) of money at any one time is 99 (99 cap). I should be aiming for Tarot cards to juice up the Vampire (enhancements are *delicious* for her) and, more importantly, *Jupiter* to boost my Flush level.\n\nThe *Vampire* is the crux of this build.  The *Baseball Card*, a Rare, is my linchpin. Since I have 4 Uncommon Jokers, the Baseball Card multiplies the multiplier of each Joker by 1.5. This will be the *true* source of my power! It goes: Bootstraps (+34 Multi), *To the Moon*, *Vampire* (X3.9), *Baseball Card*, *Hallucination*, and *Marble Joker*. If the additive Mult is first, that's best. So, the base of 18 would get 18+34=52, 52*3.9=202.8 * (1.5\\^4), which will boost each Uncommon by X1.5. The order of operations will be base mult of 18 *after* additive multipliers. \n\nNo, Odd Todd is useless. It is a no-go. I am sitting in the shop, but what I need is Tarots or Planets. Reroll is the only option here.\n\nI bought Jupiter last turn, right? I should be looking for a new card. Hieroglyph just lowers Ante and Palette/Paint Brush is hand size so Liquidation/Clearance Sale is about shop price, Jupiter was $1!\n\nLet's reroll.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
