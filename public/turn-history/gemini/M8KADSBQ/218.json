{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Play: Prioritizing Hallucination**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 20, the final ante. I'm sitting on $90, my goal is clear: maximize the score and win this run. I've got a strong set of Jokers: Zany for 3-of-a-kind, Bootstraps offering a juicy +36 Mult at this money level, Four Fingers boosts flushes/straights, To the Moon gives me interest, Seltzer offers re-triggers, Vampire triples the multiplier, Baseball Card boosts uncommons, and Hallucination is in play to trigger Tarot cards.\n\nI need to make the most of what I have. I see the shop: two packs and a couple of cards I'm not interested in. My strategy hinges on Hallucination. I have the maximum of 8 Jokers, so I'm thinking I'll open packs to trigger the Tarot cards, since I need to pick my final moves. This is where I can really capitalize, especially with Vampire if a good enhancement is pulled.\n\nGiven that I have zero consumables, I have room for the Tarot cards created by Hallucination.\n\nMy immediate action is clear. I'm going to **buy the Mega Buffoon Pack** first, since I already have 8 Jokers. This will immediately trigger Hallucination, and I'll see what the Tarot cards offer. Then, I will buy the Standard Pack to trigger Hallucination again.\n\nSo, the action is: `buy_booster` at position `1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
