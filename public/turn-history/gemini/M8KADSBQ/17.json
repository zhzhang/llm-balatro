{"reasoning":"**Jumbo Arcana Pack - The Logical First Move**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 2, Round 2. Boss Blind is down. I have $13 and a pretty solid Joker: Four Fingers, great for Flushes and Straights. No consumables yet, and a max of 5 Jokers to work with. Let's see what the shop has to offer. Bootstraps looks promising for the long game (mult!), and *To the Moon* seems key to boosting my economy (interest!). The Jumbo Arcana Pack is always a great choice for deck manipulation and potential immediate power, and the Celestial Pack is tempting for hand upgrades. Tarot Merchant is a solid voucher to add to my potential over time.\n\nGiven my money situation, I have to prioritize. Economy and immediate scoring are important. *To the Moon* boosts interest, and the Arcana pack offers a high-impact card. Should I go *To the Moon* first? If I buy it first, then the pack, I'll have just $2 left. Hmm, do I buy the Arcana pack ($6), then *To the Moon*? Leaving $2 means I'm missing out on interest, which is a bit of a bummer. But, what if the Arcana pack gives me money, like *The Hermit* (double money), or *Temperance* (sell value of Jokers, maybe?). Let's check *Bootstraps* and see if it's currently worth it, but it needs a solid economy to be worthwhile.\n\nI think the Jumbo Arcana Pack at $6 is the best bet here. I can get some immediate value. It's usually a strong choice, especially early. Buying the Tarot Merchant is a tempting, long-term play, but for $10, I can't do anything else. So, for a single action, the Jumbo Arcana is the most solid play.\n\nThe \"buy\\_booster\" action, specifically Booster 1, which corresponds to the Jumbo Arcana Pack. So the code is: `{\"action\":\"buy_booster\",\"positions\":[1],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}`. One more check... Yep, looks good!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
