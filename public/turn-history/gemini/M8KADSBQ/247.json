{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 22, and I've got $97 to work with. My primary goal is to maximize my score to beat this ante, and I'm really eyeing the final boss. I'm sitting pretty with six Joker slots filled out of seven. I've got a strong foundation with Bootstraps, To the Moon, Vampire, Baseball Card, Hallucination, and Marble Joker. The Baseball Card is key, boosting the Uncommon Jokers. My Flush is already at level 6, so that's a good start. I also have several vouchers for cheap cards and card enhancements.\n\nMy plan revolves around scaling my Vampire. I need to find ways to enhance cards for it to eat, which will quickly boost its multiplier. I also need to find any high impact Jokers and Planet cards. Looking at the shop, I see Neptune, which is good for Straight Flush, but I'm primarily focused on Flush. There is also Strength, which can rank up cards for Vampire to eat, though it's not an enhancement directly.\n\nThe Jumbo Arcana Pack is a high priority because it gives me a chance at enhancements for Vampire, but also triggers Hallucination. Hallucination gives me a 50% chance to create a Tarot card when *any* booster pack is opened, which is huge! I need to ensure I have room for the Tarot card, and I do. I have zero consumables, and can store two. I'm also looking for Planets such as Jupiter, but Celestial Pack is here.\n\nSo, the play is simple: buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack first. That's the most efficient way to get enhancements for Vampire and to trigger Hallucination, all for a mere $3. I can always reroll for better Jokers or Planets if necessary. There's plenty of money left.\n\nIt's worth noting that To the Moon and Hallucination don't count towards the standard Joker limit, so I have room for another non-negative Joker if one shows up.\n\nMy shop action is to buy the booster in position 1. That's `buy_booster 1`.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Hallucination specifically needs a free slot for a Tarot, and I've got that covered.\n\nOh, and Strength can't feed Vampire since it's only a rank up, not an enhancement. I need the enhancements!\n\nThe Jumbo Arcana Pack, definitely the best move here.\nRight, back to the booster. It's all about maximizing this turn.\n\nAnd just a quick note – I see Seltzer is gone from the current list! I played two hands last turn, so it's expired.\nOkay, buying that booster.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
