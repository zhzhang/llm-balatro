{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop Phase, Ante 6, Round 16, with $60 in the bank. The primary goal here is to maximize my score and build strength for the upcoming blinds. My current build is heavily focused on Flushes, which means evaluating the shop options through that lens.\n\nI have a solid Joker lineup: Crafty Joker provides a healthy chip boost for Flushes. Four Fingers helps with hand versatility (Flushes/Straights). \"To the Moon\" is giving me extra interest. Bootstraps is adding a significant chunk of Multiplier, and Zany is helping with the Multiplier as well. Vampire is at x3.2 Mult, which scales with enhancements. Seltzer is active and has 9 hands left.\n\nIn the shop, I see Uranus, which gives a Two Pair level up. Not useful for my Flush strategy. I also have the option to reroll for $6, and that's the big question mark. Should I spend the money, or save it? I have the Magic Trick voucher, which means playing cards can appear. Since Vampire thrives on enhanced cards, this is a tempting possibility, but there are no booster packs currently. I've already leveled up my Flush to level 4.\n\nI'm getting $24 interest per round due to \"To the Moon\" and my current cash. Given my current hand strength, I'm leaning toward advancing to the next round, saving money.\n\nLet's do a quick calculation: a standard Flush with my current setup (without Seltzer) would get me around 22,848 points. With Seltzer, the Flush gets me 28,288 points, and since Ante 6 Big Blind is usually around 30k-40k, I'm pretty close.\n\nOkay, so moving on looks good. I was forgetting about Magic Trick and that potentially enhanced cards might appear, but since there are no booster packs, it seems that I'm better off continuing to gain interest. Also, \"To the Moon\" makes holding onto money extremely valuable.\n\nI think I'll move on to `round_select` to bank more interest and potentially find more enhancers later. But before I do that, I'm checking my Joker order.\n\nThe order matters: I need additive Multiplier jokers before my multiplicative Multiplier (Vampire) in order to maximize the effects. Crafty Joker can stay at the top. The current order looks correct: Bootstraps (+24 Mult), Zany (+12 Mult), and then Vampire (x3.2) - this maximizes the benefit of Vampire's x3.2. Seltzer will stay at the end since it retriggers cards which happen *during* the scoring phase.\n\nFinal check on the shop: Uranus is $1. Not worth it.\n\nDecision: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
