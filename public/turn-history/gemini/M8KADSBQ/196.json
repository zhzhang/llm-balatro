{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment and Round Transition**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 7, Round 18. I'm in the SHOP phase with $54 to my name. I've got a decent Joker setup: Zany for a 3-of-a-kind boost, Bootstraps offering a nice mult kick, Four Fingers for those flush and straight plays, and To the Moon adding interest. Seltzer can retrigger cards (very useful!), Vampire's got that delicious scaling, and Baseball Card is giving my Uncommons a mult boost. I also have Justice and The Tower ready to be used on cards.\n\nNo cards, boosters, or vouchers available in the shop, so the options are pretty limited. I can't use Justice or The Tower here, they're for in-hand card modifications, and selling them now wouldn't be worth it, given how I plan to use them with Vampire. Rerolling the shop costs $5, which is a consideration. My primary goal is to maximize Vampire's scaling to ensure I can beat Ante 8.\n\nLet's look at the Jokers. The current order is: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, and Baseball Card. Baseball Card boosts other Uncommon Jokers. The ideal order is Additive Mult first, then X-Mult. Baseball Card provides a global X1.5 to Uncommon Jokers, so its position doesn't strictly matter *unless* there's another X-Mult Joker.\n\nI'm not selling any Jokers, and I can't buy anything either, so those options are off the table.\n\nRerolling would drop me to $49, which slightly reduces Bootstraps and interest, but I'm looking to optimize Vampire scaling. Finding more Tarot cards or a Standard Pack to get enhancements for Vampire is ideal, but the odds are too low to justify the reroll. I'm already at a maximum of two consumables.\n\nThe shop is empty of usable items. I'll save my money to maintain my Bootstraps mult and interest generation, and proceed to the blind.\n\nSo, I'm at the blind selection.\n\nAlright, current money is $54. Bootstraps offers +20 mult, and my interest is looking good at $20. The total score potential is high, so there's no need to reroll.\n\nLet me double-check my Joker order: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, and Baseball Card.\n\nI should prioritize Additive, Retrigger, then X-Mult Jokers.\n\nThe current order is fine: Additive mult (Zany, Bootstraps) goes before X-Mult (Vampire). Seltzer is a retrigger, and that works independently.\n\n\"Baseball Card\" boosts Uncommons, which is a global X1.5. This means it boosts each of the Uncommon Jokers for each Joker.\n\nI think I'm good to go.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
