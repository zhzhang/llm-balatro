{"reasoning":"**Current Shop State Analysis and Action**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4, Round 10 with $61. My current Jokers are: Four Fingers (good for Flushes, and I have 15 played), To the Moon (interest booster), Bootstraps (flat Mult, currently +24, very strong), and Vampire (X2.5 Mult that gets stronger by removing enhancements). I also have Hieroglyph, a voucher that reduces the Ante and hand size.\n\nThe shop has: Gluttonous Joker (+3 Mult for Clubs, weak), The Sun (Tarot: Hearts), Jumbo Arcana Pack, Jumbo Standard Pack, and Clearance Sale (voucher for 25% discount).\n\nMy strategy is centered on Vampire. I need to feed it enhancements. I have enough money that To the Moon's interest is near maxed, meaning I have a good amount of money each round.\n\nGiven that, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Clearance Sale**: This voucher immediately saves me money on everything in the shop, which is an immediate return and makes other purchases cheaper. With $61, I can easily afford it.\n\n2.  **Jumbo Arcana Pack**: My top priority is the Jumbo Arcana Pack, to get Tarot cards that can become enhancements for Vampire.\n\n3.  **The Sun**: Since I am going for Flushes, it helps by converting cards to Hearts, but I can probably skip this one. Vampire doesn't care about suits unless there are enhancements, and I should focus on enhancements right now.\n\n    *Reroll* is an option, but not now.\n\nSo, I will buy the Clearance Sale first. It's a no-brainer given the current state. The action is `buy_voucher` at position `1`. I've checked the schema, and this is the correct action to take. I'm confident in this play; I've thought through the implications and confirmed my calculations.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
