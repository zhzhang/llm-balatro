{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Ante 7, Scaling Vampire**\n\nOkay, Ante 7, Round 18, SHOP phase. Need to maximize score and get Vampire scaling. I've got $56, which is good. The important Jokers are Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, and Baseball Card. Baseball Card is *key* because it's going to multiply each of my Uncommon Jokers by 1.5. I've got five Uncommon Jokers, so that's a big multiplier. I'm focusing on getting Vampire to scale off of enhancements.\n\nMy current mental math (very rough!) tells me that without adding to the Jokers, I am already at ~25x Mult.\n\nI've got \"The Hanged Man\" (removes cards) and \"Justice\" (enhances a card to Glass) as consumables. The shop has \"The Tower\" (Stone enhancement) for $1 and a Standard Pack for $2. I need those enhancements for Vampire!\n\nI need to figure out the best use of my money, slots and consumables. Buying the Standard Pack doesn't take up a consumable slot, so I can buy it now. I can use the Standard Pack to get a card to consume with Vampire.\n\nLet's buy that Standard Pack ($2) first. I am now at $54. I'll stay above the interest cap.\n\nNow I need \"The Tower\". I *could* sell a consumable to free up a slot, but let's check the rules again. \"Justice\" and \"The Hanged Man\" both *require* a target card. I can't buy \"The Tower\" (which I *need* for Vampire) while my consumable slots are full. I probably should sell \"The Hanged Man\" for $1 and buy \"The Tower\" ($1). I'll prioritize scaling Vampire.\n\nWait, I don't think I can do that. I already bought something in the current shop turn (I bought Justice last round). I should have bought \"The Tower\" FIRST.\n\nOkay, I bought the Standard Pack. My money is now $54. My slots are fine. Now I need to select the card.\n\nSo my order is: Buy Booster Pack (`buy_booster`, position: `[1]`).\n\nI need to make sure I understand the Joker activation order correctly. It is: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, and Baseball Card. Because Baseball Card acts as a *multiplier* applied at the uncommon joker position, it's best to have the non-X multipliers before the X multipliers, and the X multipliers before Baseball Card itself. So that order is optimal.\n\nSo, Standard Pack first. Money $56 -> $54. Now, I have selected the card.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
