{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision Making**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5/8, Round 12. I'm in the shop phase with $41. My Jokers are pretty good: Crafty (Flush chips), Four Fingers (4-card Flush/Straight), To the Moon (Interest), Bootstraps (Mult from money), Zany (a negative, though). Vampire (x2.9, scales from enhancements). I've got a Strength consumable and two slots. Vouchers are Liquidation (50% off shop), Clearance Sale (25% off shop), and Hieroglyph. The shop itself has a Green Joker, The Devil, Celestial Pack, and Jumbo Spectral Pack.\n\nThe primary goals are to maximize score and build long-term viability. I'm focusing on a Flush strategy, with Vampire scaling through enhancements and Bootstraps benefiting from high gold reserves. The Liquidation and Clearance Sale vouchers are making the shop ridiculously cheap right now, which is great. To the Moon is adding extra interest, about $1 per $5. With $41, I'm earning an additional $8.\n\nMy priority is the Jumbo Spectral Pack. It offers the best chance at a game-changing card, like Ankh, Hex, or Aura. The Celestial Pack is second, to level up those Flushes. The Devil is third; it's cheap and can feed Vampire or generate extra money. The Green Joker is not really aligned with this build.\n\nI've got a single consumable slot open. I'm going to take the Jumbo Spectral Pack immediately. It's the most likely to have immediate impact.\n\nThe plan is to buy the Jumbo Spectral Pack (Position 2). The \"buy_booster\" action. This will cost $3, leaving me with $38, still enough to get that sweet interest. The Spectral pack should be useful right away, so I can use it. I'm also considering what might happen if the Spectral pack gives me a Tarot card.\n\nPreviously I bought Liquidation, but now is the time to purchase. Let's stick with the plan. It's time to \"buy_booster\" position 2, the Jumbo Spectral Pack.\n\nI have double-checked the action and the shop. I should be at $38. Still planning.\nNow, looking at the commands, it's buy_booster 2. Checking the json it fits the template I need: `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}` and there is space in the schema to include:  `\"estimated_chips\": null`, `\"intended_hand_type\": null`. Let's stick with my plan to buy the Jumbo Spectral Pack. Then I can continue to build up.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
