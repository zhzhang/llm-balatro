{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7/8, Round 19, with $70 in the bank. Shop phase. I've got a solid Joker setup: *Zany*, *Bootstraps*, *Four Fingers*, *To the Moon*, *Seltzer*, *Vampire*, *Baseball Card*, and *Hallucination* – all in the bag! I'm thinking about how to maximize my scoring potential, especially for Ante 8. I need to be strategic.\n\nMy immediate focus is *Vampire*. It gains X-Mult by removing enhancements. The *Hallucination* Joker is what I will need to get a boost for my *Vampire* joker. I need to figure out how to get Tarot cards. The *Hallucination* Joker has a chance to create a Tarot card when I open a Booster Pack. And, Bingo! I have two Booster Packs available in the shop, a Standard Pack for $2 and a Jumbo Standard Pack for $3. These are bargains, thanks to my vouchers. I also need to think about *Baseball Card*, giving X1.5 Mult to Uncommon Jokers (which I have a few of: *Bootstraps*, *Four Fingers*, *Seltzer*, and *Vampire*).\n\nMy plan is clear: Buy the Booster Packs to activate *Hallucination*. I'll try to get Tarot cards, which I can use to enhance cards. Then, *Vampire* will \"eat\" those enhanced cards, increasing its X-Mult. It's a solid strategy! Buying packs also gives me a chance to pick up any useful cards that might come my way. Even though I have a pretty good deck, more Spades or high-rank cards are always welcome.\n\nI have $70. Since the packs are cheap, and the Jumbo Standard Pack has a better chance of giving me more cards, I'm going for that first. I'm going to `buy_booster 2` (Jumbo Standard Pack). Yes, this is the way. I then need to make sure I get the next action right.\n\nBuying the Jumbo pack won't hurt my money situation too much, and the potential gain from *Vampire* is higher than a few points from *Bootstraps*. *Hallucination* is a Negative joker so it is not taking up a main joker slot. My Uncommon Jokers (Bootstraps, Four Fingers, Seltzer, Vampire) will become more powerful with *Baseball Card*.\n\nI'm checking the schema, I won't need `buy_and_use_consumable` or `buy_card`. The best course of action is to buy the booster packs and trigger *Hallucination*. Buying the Jumbo pack first has the best chance to get me a Tarot card.\n\nAlright, the action is `buy_booster` and the position is `[2]`.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
