{"reasoning":"**My Turn to Strategize in the Mega Spectral Pack**\n\nOkay, here we go. We're in Ante 1, Round 1, with the \"Four Fingers\" joker giving me a hand flexibility for flushes and straights with just four cards. The \"Mega Spectral Pack\" is up, and I have a crucial decision to make. Incantation already gave me a solid start – two Gold cards and two Steel cards. Now, it's about maximizing value.\n\nThe choices are: Medium, Deja Vu, and Cryptid. Medium feels underwhelming now. Deja Vu is tempting, but Cryptid stands out. It can copy a card, so should I copy a Steel card (7s or 6h), that's a huge mult boost? Or should I go for immediate economy? Deja Vu on a Steel is a x2.25 mult. If I do Cryptid on 7s, the total is x3.375.\n\nMy gut says Cryptid on one of my Steel cards (7s or 6h), that is a huge early game boost. But then I remember: economy is king in the early game. With two Gold cards in hand, getting a copy of one and getting a total of $9 per round is amazing.\n\nNow, wait, if I can just hold three Gold cards, that's $9 every round! That's incredibly powerful this early and very helpful with winning.\n\nOkay, let's revisit this. Cryptid creates copies. So if I have three, that's $9. Deja Vu can modify a card, and that would be great. But Cryptid is more immediate. It just gives me three cards. I'm going with economy: Cryptid on a Gold card.\n\nI think Cryptid (3) on 10d (position 8) is the play. Okay, that feels right. I'm going to do that! No, wait, if I use Deja Vu I get $6 every round, but Cryptid is $9. Cryptid wins.\n\nLet's do this. I'll take Cryptid (position 3) on the 10d (position 8), so I can have three of them.\n\nNow, I am *sure* that will do the most. Let's make sure that's correct:\n\n\"select 3 8\".\nYup, that's the command.\n\nEconomy first. Now I'll be in a good spot for the shop.\nOk, I am ready. \"select\" command: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3, 8]}`. That is that. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,8]"}
