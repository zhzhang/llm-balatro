{"reasoning":"**Prioritizing Vampire's Hunger: A Standard Pack First**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. We're at Ante 4/8, Round 11, with $56 in the bank and a solid Joker lineup. My current Jokers are *Four Fingers* for flush potential, *To the Moon* providing a hefty $16 interest per round, *Bootstraps* amplifying my economy, the crucial *Vampire* aiming for XMult scaling, and the *Zany Joker* giving a helpful +12 Mult with a negative effect that I can use to my advantage (+1 Joker Slot). I've got a Clearance Sale voucher for 25% off purchases, and a Hieroglyph voucher for -1 Ante, -1 hand.\n\nThe shop offers a few tempting choices: the *Business Card* which offers additional money per face card, a *Celestial Pack*, and a *Standard Pack*. My focus is on the long game. I'm flush (no pun intended) with cash, so I can ignore the $3 Business Card for now. It might be good, but I have other priorities. Celestial Packs are good, since they can contain Jupiter which can greatly enhance my flushes, but my main focus is on the *Vampire* Joker.\n\nThe *Vampire* Joker is the key to massive scaling, and it needs enhanced cards. The *Standard Pack* offers a chance at those enhancements, which is absolutely vital. Any enhancement will immediately boost *Vampire's* power. Getting enhanced cards into the deck is a top priority, even above the immediate advantage of a Celestial Pack. I have $56, so I will buy the Standard Pack first before buying anything else.\n\nI'm thinking about the order of purchases again. *Vampire* is the engine, and scaling *Vampire* is the top priority for this game.\n\nI'll buy the *Standard Pack*, hoping for enhancements to feed *Vampire*.\n\nFinally, the action is: `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
