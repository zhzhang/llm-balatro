{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Round 17, ante 6/8. I've got $75, and the Boss blind is demanding 40,000 chips with no repeat hand types. This is a tough one, but my Jokers are pretty well-aligned: Crafty Joker for flush chips, Four Fingers making flushes and straights easier, To the Moon boosting my interest, Bootstraps for big multipliers, Zany Joker for a negative (but free) slot, Vampire for scaling, and Seltzer, which is temporary. My flush is at Level 4, so I need to keep leveling it up.\n\nThe Shop is showing: a 4 of Clubs for $1 (useless for Vampire), Superposition for $2, and boosters. I also have some vouchers: Liquidation, Magic Trick, Clearance Sale, and Hieroglyph. \n\nVampire's my main multiplier now, so I really want to feed it enhanced cards. Standard packs are the best for that. Celestial packs are for hand leveling, which helps ensure success against the boss (leveling up Flush or maybe Straight/Three of a Kind). Superposition needs a Straight and an Ace to do anything. I've got Four Fingers, but I don't really see a lot of Aces coming and I'm full on Joker slots. It's not worth selling one of my good Jokers for.\n\nTo the Moon is fantastic, it's making my interest income huge, so I want to keep my money high for interest and also Bootstraps. Vampire is at x3.3, and Seltzer has 7 hands left.\n\nNow, buying a Jumbo Standard Pack ($3) is really cheap, and it might have an enhanced card for Vampire. Same with the Celestial Pack ($2). Leveling up my Flush hand is a good play for the boss.\n\nSo, here's my plan. I'm going to *buy_booster 2* (Celestial Pack) for the hand leveling. No, wait, first, I need to buy it. And double-check that I have the command right. *buy_booster 2* is the command, yes.\n\nOkay, should I buy Standard *before* Celestial? Nah, Celestial is better for scaling early.\n\nActually, before that, I need to check the shop cards. That 4 of Clubs is cheap, but not enhanced. Useless for Vampire. Superposition... no.\n\nSo, I'm going to start with *buy_booster 2*. Then I'll check what's in there. I'll then grab a Standard Pack. Then, maybe reroll if it feels right. But I want to keep my cash for To the Moon and Bootstraps.\n\n*Side thought: Magic Trick lets me buy cards, but Vampire needs enhanced. This 4 of Clubs is NOT enhanced.*\n\nAlright, so the first action is *buy_booster 2*. Now, to see what the Celestial Pack holds...\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
