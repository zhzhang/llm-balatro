{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis - Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, so it's ante 2/8, round 4, and I'm in the PLANET\\_PACK game step. I've got $5, which generates $2 in interest thanks to \"To the Moon\". My Joker lineup is shaping up: \"Four Fingers\" is crucial for Flushes and Straights; \"To the Moon\" is boosting interest; \"Bootstraps\" is giving a nice mult boost, currently +2; and \"Vampire\" is enhancing my cards.\n\nMy current focus is on building around Flushes and potentially Straights, leveraging \"Four Fingers\" and \"Vampire\" for enhancements. I've played mostly Flushes, all hands are level 1, and my base Flush is at 35/4. The pack's offerings are Pluto, Mars, and Mercury.\n\n*   **Pluto**: High Card, +1 Mult, +10 Chips.\n*   **Mars**: Four of a Kind, +3 Mult, +30 Chips.\n*   **Mercury**: Pair, +1 Mult, +15 Chips.\n\nIdeally, I'd prefer Jupiter (Flush) or Saturn (Straight), but those aren't available. Between these options, Mars (Four of a Kind) presents the highest raw stat increase per upgrade. However, with \"Four Fingers\", it doesn't align with my immediate flush strategy. Mercury (Pair) and Pluto (High Card) are backup options but are very weak at level 1. I still need to increase the hand levels, as each level increases the power of a card.\n\nEven though I'm not prioritizing Four of a Kind, I acknowledge that Mars offers the best overall stats. This would level up that hand, which would be better than upgrading the weaker backup hands.\n\nIf I'm not finding what I want, increasing the level of all hands is better than skipping, so let's get that level up.\n\nConsidering the Jokers, \"Vampire\" doesn't care about the type of card; and \"Four Fingers\" doesn't affect Four of a Kind. I'm most likely to fall back on Pair or High Card in a pinch. With this in mind, let's look at the raw numbers.\n\n*   Pair (Lvl 1): 10/2. Upgrade -> 25/3.\n*   4oak (Lvl 1): 60/7. Upgrade -> 90/10.\n\nIf I can't find Jupiter, Mars is the highest value pick to level a hand. So, it's a clear choice: I'll pick Mars, upgrade that Four of a Kind, and hope I can find that Jupiter.\n\n**Action: `select` positions `[2]` (Mars).**\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
