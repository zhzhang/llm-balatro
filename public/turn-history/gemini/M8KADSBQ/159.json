{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Blind Selection - Playing for Power-Ups**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 6, Round 15, and we're at the blind selection screen. My money's decent at $61, but the Small Blind is 20,000 chips, the Big Blind is 30,000, and the Boss Blind is a pain with \"No repeat hand types.\" The reward for playing is $3, interest, and the shop.\n\nI've got a solid Joker setup: Crafty for Flush power, Four Fingers for potential 4-card Flushes, To the Moon for interest, Bootstraps boosting my multiplier, Zany (negative) for Three-of-a-Kind, Vampire to multiply the score, and Seltzer, which is huge – it retriggers *all* cards for 10 hands, meaning a 4-card Flush gets doubled with its score and Joker effects.\n\nMy current Flush strength is looking pretty good: 145 base chips, 32 mult, and Vampire's x3.2 multiplier, but with Seltzer, it's going to be a lot higher! I'm thinking a single Flush with the retriggers should be enough to easily clear the 20,000 chip requirement for the Small Blind.\n\nThe upcoming Boss Blind, \"The Eye,\" that restricts hand types, is the primary concern. I need to be able to score 40,000 chips with a single Flush, and if I can't, have a backup hand in the back pocket! But even so, one Flush with Seltzer and Vampire should get me there.\n\nThe Skip tag, which grants a free Foil Joker, is a dud right now since I have seven Jokers. I need the shop access more for Tarot packs and Planet cards, especially Jupiter. I need to find some enhancements for Vampire. I need those boosters, I can't go to round 17 without more multiplier, or the game is over. \n\nSo, I'm going to play this round to get the shop, the money, and keep looking for those crucial power-ups. Now, I have to be smart about what I buy in the shop!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
