{"reasoning":"**Analyzing My Options in the Shop**\n\nAlright, I'm in the Shop phase of Balatro, Ante 2, Round 2. Let's see... I've got a measly $2. Hmm, not ideal. I'm rocking Four Fingers, To the Moon, and Bootstraps as Jokers – a decent foundation, but I need to survive the next round to continue building.\n\nThe shop itself is offering a Celestial Pack for $4 and the Tarot Merchant voucher for a whopping $10. Forget that. I have no consumable cards to use or sell. Rerolling is out of the question as well at $5. Looks like I've already exhausted any immediate card purchases. And selling a Joker? Absolutely not. Four Fingers is critical for reliable hand size, To the Moon keeps the money flowing in this economy build, and Bootstraps is the core of my scaling multiplier. I just bought these, so getting rid of any would be a setback.\n\nSo, I'm stuck, which means my only move is to advance to the next round. It's a bit of a gamble, but I see no other viable path.\nI'll give the jokers a quick inspection for positioning that matters. Okay, everything's in good shape. Bootstraps is a straight +Mult, so no specific placement is needed at the moment.\n\nAlright, moving on. `round_select` it is.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
