My primary objective is to reach 800 chips to beat the Small Blind. I have a few useful jokers: \\\"Four Fingers\\\" for easier Flushes and Straights, \\\"To the Moon\\\" for interest, and \\\"Bootstraps,\\\" although that's not helping me at the moment as I only have two dollars. I'm sitting on $2, and have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining.\\n\\nLooking at my hand, I've got a mix of cards, specifically an Ace, King, and Six of Spades, along with a Queen of Hearts, a Seven of Clubs, a Five of Diamonds, and a Three and Two of Diamonds. With \\\"Four Fingers\\\" active, I can make Flushes or Straights with just four cards which is my primary plan.\\n\\nFirst, I quickly analyze my current hand, I see I have three spades and three diamonds, so I can try for a flush.  I have 5, 6, and 7 making a straight, but with \\\"Four Fingers\\\" Flushes are easier. No pairs or anything else immediately useful. The high card Ace is the only thing playable at the moment.\\n\\nThe optimal strategy is to discard some cards to improve my odds of getting a Flush. I have 3 spades and 3 diamonds. I need to figure out which to keep. The high-value spades are the best, so I'll keep the Ace, King, and Six of Spades, and get rid of the other cards. I also have a 5, 6, 7 straight, but Flushes are better with Four Fingers.\\n\\nI'll keep a list and review.\\n\\nAfter another look, I need to discard the non-spades. The Queen of Hearts, Seven of Clubs, Five of Diamonds, Three of Diamonds, and Two of Diamonds are the prime candidates for the discard pile. I want to look for a Flush, or a straight if necessary. \\n\\nI'll discard the Queen, Seven, Five, Three, and Two, keeping the Ace, King, and Six of Spades, and then drawing five new cards. That means cards in positions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 need to go.\\n\\nBefore I lock in my decision, I have to check the remaining cards. There are 11 Spades and 13 Diamonds. Statistically, a Diamond Flush is slightly more likely, but the Ace and King of Spades are higher value cards. I'm going to discard the Queen, Seven, Five, Three, and Two to give me a 72% chance of getting a flush in 5 cards, if I draw 1 Spade.\\n\\nLet's quickly check this. 7 of Clubs, 5 of Diamonds and 6 of Spades (indices 5, 6 and 3) make a straight, but Flushes are still better.\\n\\nOkay, let's keep the Spades: Ace (1), King (2), and 6 (3).\\n\\nOkay, quick check of the cards again, just to make sure. Yes, discard the 4-8. No, I will not keep 7 or 5, unless I change my mind. My current hand has a low probability of success, but my discard is safe and optimal.\\n\\nAfter another review, if I discard the Five and Six of Spades, my chance of success goes down, as I'd be looking for a straight, and Flushes are better.\\n\\nThe indices are correct: 1-3 are spades, discard 4-8. Let's make sure. The Spades are more valuable chips. Flushes are better with \\\"Four Fingers\\\".\\n\\nOkay, the plan is confirmed. I will discard cards in the positions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. That will leave my three spades in hand, to draw five new cards. I have 4 hands, with 4 discards. I can fish for a Flush, since \\\"Four Fingers\\\" only needs four cards for a flush.\\n\\nOne more quick review: A Flush gets me 35 chips at base, and a 4x multiplier. A Straight gets 30 chips. I will have a lot more chips with flushes.\\n\\nSince I have Bootstraps but it gives +0 Mult, I can't rely on it.\\n\\nSo, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 need to be discarded. Wait, no, I'll keep the 6 Spades. Okay, here is the action: Discard cards in positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 4 5 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 25]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 3\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Four Fingers.

I've got a couple of Jokers I need to leverage: \\\"Four Fingers\\\" (flushes and straights with 4 cards!), \\\"To the Moon\\\" (interest booster), and \\\"Bootstraps\\\" (+2 mult for every $5 I have - currently +0, so useless). Money is scarce, only $2.\\n\\nLet's look at the hand: Ace of Spades (+11), King of Spades (+10), 7 of Spades (+7), 6 of Spades (+6), 9 of Hearts (+9), 5 of Clubs (+5), Ace of Diamonds (+11), Queen of Diamonds (+10). With \\\"Four Fingers\\\", the first four cards are a Spade Flush! Ace, King, 7, 6. No Straights are obvious without a discard (5,6,7 needs 4 or 8). \\n\\nSo, I'm playing the Flush (Level 1). Base chips are 35, base multiplier is 4. The played cards contribute 11 + 10 + 7 + 6 = 34 chips. Total chips are 35 + 34 = 69. Total Multiplier is still just 4. Total score calculation: 69 * 4 = 276 chips.\\n\\nNow, I need 800. 276 is about a third of the way there. With four hands and this play, I'll have three hands and 524 chips to go. Should I discard instead? Maybe if I can get a better hand with Diamonds (I have an Ace and Queen of Diamonds) and discard hearts and clubs. But the flush is great with \\\"Four Fingers\\\" now. But should I discard the Spades? The Spades are good cards though.\\n\\nI've got a pair of Aces in Spades and Diamonds and a Queen of Diamonds. But the flush is much better than two pair, especially with the Joker.\\n\\nOkay, Flush (Spades): Ace, King, 7, 6. ~276 chips. Remaining cards will be 9H, 5C, AD, QD. Wait, \\\"Four Fingers\\\" says I can use 4 cards in the flush. I can play the 5th card too. But it won't contribute chips.\\n\\nAction: `play 1 2 3 4`. Intended hand: `flush`. Estimated chips: ~276. Should I discard instead? Maybe discarding the other cards will get more Spades? It's close enough.\\n\\nIf I play this flush now, I use 1 hand and draw 4 new cards.\\n\\nOkay, let me check the numbers.\\nBase: 35 chips, 4 multiplier. Played cards: A(11), K(10), 7(7), 6(6). Total Chips: 69. Total Multiplier: 4. Score: 276. No better play is immediately obvious.\\n\\nI could discard the other cards to try to find more Spades for a 5-card flush (slightly more chips) or to improve the 4-card flush (replace 6 and 7 with higher Spades). It seems like a decent plan but the current hand is good. \\n\\nThere are 10 Spades left in the deck. 3 discards. But \\\"Four Fingers\\\" makes this a solid move. With \\\"Four Fingers\\\", this is efficient.\\n\\nAction: play\\nPositions: \\\\[1, 2, 3, 4]\\nIntended hand: flush\\nEstimated chips: 276.\\n\\nWait, should I include the 5th card? Yes, if I play `1 2 3 4 7` (Ace S, King S, 7 S, 6 S, Ace D), it's still a flush (of Spades). The Ace of Diamonds won't contribute, but will let me draw a new card. It does allow the Ace of Diamonds to get out of my hand and potentially be replaced by a more important card. But I have two Diamonds (Ace, Queen), so I'll save them.\\n\\nFinal refinement:\\n(35 + 11 + 10 + 7 + 6) * 4 = 69 * 4 = 276.\\n\\nI'll check the last played hands. Previous Flushes have had 320 and 288 chips.\\n\\nAction: play\\nPositions: [1, 2, 3, 4]\\nHand: flush\\nChips: 276\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 flush 276\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 26]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 3\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Four Fingers.

I'm in the small blind, need 800 chips, and only have 276.  I have $2 in money and, most importantly, only three hands left.  I have the \\\"Four Fingers\\\" joker which means I can use four cards for a flush or straight, and the \\\"To the Moon\\\" joker (which doesn't matter yet). I also have \\\"Bootstraps\\\" but it's not currently contributing. Crucially, I'm holding a Gold Card \\u2013 the 10 of Diamonds \\u2013 which gives me $3 *if* I still have it in my hand at the end of the round.  That's my priority.\\n\\nI've got a hand with some potential: 5S, 2S, 9H, 5C, Ace of Diamonds, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, and my Gold Card, 10 of Diamonds. I initially considered a Diamond flush (Ace, Queen, Jack, 10) but that would mean losing the Gold Card bonus.  I also looked at a potential straight (9, 10, J, Q) but again, that uses the Gold Card. Neither of those options are optimal, even if they would get me past 800 chips in two rounds.\\n\\nMy primary thought is, how do I get to 800+ chips while *keeping* the Gold Card? The answer is to discard the garbage (the low cards: 5S, 2S, 9H, 5C) and hope to draw more Diamonds or high cards. If I get one more Diamond, I'll play the 4-card Diamond flush to maximize my score without using the Gold Card and then hold on to the Gold Card on the final hand to guarantee my $3. I figure I can get around 280-300 per hand and if the math works out, that's enough to clear the 800 chip hurdle.\\n\\nSo, the play is to discard the 5S, 2S, 9H, and 5C and hope for a good draw. This strategy gives me the best chance to maximize my profits with a small risk. Let's do it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 3\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Four Fingers.

  "reasoning": "**The Poker Calculus**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm sitting on a small blind, needing to hit 800 chips to stay afloat, and I've only got 276. Two bucks in the kitty. I've got a little extra juice with the \"To the Moon\" joker – that’s nice for the long game – but I need immediate gain, and \"Four Fingers\" is my main play here. Three hands left. I need roughly 175 chips each hand to get to 800 and not lose the blinds.\n\nRight now, I'm holding a hand with a promising Diamond Flush. Ace, Queen, Jack, Ten of Diamonds - perfect. Four Fingers is key here. I see a play: get 304 chips from the Diamond Flush and a multiplier of four. If I hold the gold 10 of Diamonds, this is good. I calculate that 304 chips would leave me with 580. Two hands to get 220 chips. I could easily make that with another flush, or even a straight. It's safe, and I keep the gold card.\n\nShould I be more aggressive? No, I am going to make a hand that is safe.\n\nI've got the 9 of Clubs I could throw in there to draw a new card. It won’t affect the flush, so why not? I have to look at this more carefully; what are the exact cards? I can't accidentally make a flush, that is for sure. After reviewing I decided to discard the 9 and the others.\n\nOkay, let's play the flush. Ace, Queen, Jack, and 10 of Diamonds. Four cards for the flush with a 9 in the play, plus the draw, that's the play!\n\nSo, the action is \"play,\" I'm selecting positions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The intended hand type is flush, and I'm estimating around 304 chips.\n\nThe hand, after verification is: `{\"action\": \"play\", \"positions\": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\", \"estimated_chips\": 304}`\n\n\n"
