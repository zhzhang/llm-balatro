{"reasoning":"**My Thought Process: Buying the Arcana Pack**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 2, Round 3, SHOP phase. I've got $12. My Jokers are \"Four Fingers\" (good for flushes/straights), \"To the Moon\" (interest!), and \"Bootstraps\" (+Mult). I just cleared the Small Blind with a Straight Flush – score is on track. Let's see what the shop offers... Hmm, \"The Tower\", \"Raised Fist,\" and a couple of Arcana Packs. Also a \"Tarot Merchant,\" which is way too expensive right now.\n\nMy goals are clear: maximize score and build a strong deck for future Antes. \"To the Moon\" and \"Bootstraps\" work together beautifully, and \"Four Fingers\" makes scoring flushes/straights easier, but I want to build towards future rounds. I'm getting $4 interest currently ($2 from the base, plus another $2 thanks to \"To the Moon\" - $1 per $5 at my current total). Bootstraps is giving me +4 mult.\n\nLet's evaluate the shop cards. \"Raised Fist\" is tempting for early-game mult but depends on what cards I have in hand, and I think it's worth it *right now* with Bootstraps +4 mult. \"The Tower\" is okay. Stone cards aren't as good for \"Four Fingers\" (but helps other hands). But Arcana Packs are usually the best value, letting me improve my deck or generate economy.\n\nI need to make a decision. I can buy an Arcana Pack ($4, leaves me with $8), buy the Tarot Merchant ($10, leaves me with $2, risky, which isn't the best play), buy \"Raised Fist\" ($5, leaves me with $7), or reroll (not worth it).\n\nLet's think. If I buy an Arcana Pack, I have $8. That means only $2 interest, but it could be worth it. If I buy both Arcana Packs, I have $4, no interest. Buying one Arcana Pack gives me $4 interest.\n\nAlright, the best move is one Arcana Pack. That's better than getting more money right now. I have to think in the long term for later hands. The Tower is okay, but I prefer the Arcana Packs.\n\nSo, I'm going with Arcana Pack 1 ($4).\n\nI need to decide the action, and I'll focus on the buy_booster command. Now that I know the plan is confirmed, I'll provide the right answer. First, I need to check the command again.\n\nLet's evaluate... `buy_booster <booster_pack_position>`. Positions are 1 or 2 (Arcana Pack).\n\nOkay, that seems logical.\n\nI'm thinking one more thing: \"Raised Fist.\" Maybe it's a better play. However, I have \"To the Moon,\" which rewards saving money. Since this is an uncommon joker, it's better to stay on track.\n\nSo, it is still the Arcana Pack.\n\nAlright, I have the final plan: `buy_booster` for Arcana Pack 1.\n\nI have $12, the cost is $4. After the purchase, I have $8. I re-check To the Moon: $1 per $5 (x 2 for $2 interest) = $2. Total interest is $4. Now I get $2 interest.\n\nAlright, I need to generate the valid JSON. The action is `buy_booster`, the position is `[1]` (Arcana Pack).\n\nI confirm the format. The current state is that I have $12, buy the booster, the interest is going to go to $2. The state is good overall. The next is `buy_booster 1`, and the JSON looks like: `{\"action\":\"buy_booster\",\"positions\":[1],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
