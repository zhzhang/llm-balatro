{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Prioritizing the Vampire Engine**\n\nOkay, we're in Ante 4, Round 10, sitting on $47. The primary goal is to feed Vampire, the scaling engine. My hand features: \"Four Fingers\" for Flush/Straights, \"To the Moon\" for interest, \"Bootstraps\" scaling with money (currently +18 Mult), and Vampire, which is a multiplier that gains power from enhanced cards. I have one Joker slot open.\n\nThe shop offers a few choices: a Gluttonous Joker (+3 Mult for Clubs, weak), \"The Sun\" (converts three cards to Hearts, potentially aiding Flushes), and a Jumbo Standard Pack. I've also got \"Clearance Sale\" as a voucher which is nice. I don't need \"Hieroglyph\".\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n*   **Gluttonous Joker:** Not great synergy. Pass.\n*   **The Sun:** Useful for Flushes given Four Fingers, but not an immediate Vampire boost. This could be bought as a consumable to \"hold\".\n*   **Jumbo Standard Pack:** This is the key. The best path to finding enhanced cards, which fuels Vampire. It's a gamble but a good one.\n\nThe money situation: $47 means interest is almost maxed, so \"To the Moon\" has kicked in to earn more ($9 on top of the base $5). Buying the Jumbo pack is a low-risk, high-reward move.\n\nAction: `buy_booster 1` is the correct action and `positions` is an array that contains the position.\n\nWait, should I buy \"The Sun\" as a consumable? Buying it now to have it ready for a flush later is a viable strategy. But the Standard Pack is my highest priority.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan. **Buy the Jumbo Pack.** Then I will consider what to do with the \"Sun\" card.\n\nAction: `buy_booster`\nPosition: `[1]`\n\nRe-verifying with the schema... `action` must be `buy_booster`, and `positions` is an array. Correct.\n\nOkay, let's open that pack! Then I'll decide if The Sun is worth grabbing.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
