{"reasoning":"**Analysis Complete: Time to Advance**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante 6, Round 17. Shop phase. I have $48, which is pretty good thanks to *To the Moon*. The core of my build is set: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, and the all-important Baseball Card. I've got a strong engine going with the Uncommons generating multipliers off Baseball Card. I've reordered the Jokers to optimize the multiplier chain – Vampire's x3.3 right before Baseball Card is key. It's the best arrangement.\n\nI reviewed my shop choices. *Madness* is definitely a hard pass. I don't want to risk destroying a Joker in this setup. Rerolling is an option, but with this solid of an engine, it's a gamble I don't need to take right now. I have *The Hanged Man*, which is great for thinning the deck in the next round. I'll need it.\n\nI did a deep dive on how *Baseball Card* specifically interacts with the other Jokers. Now, I understand it perfectly. It's five Uncommon Jokers total, so 1.5 ^ 5 = ~7.59x multiplier plus Vampire's own x3.3.\n\nI did the math on interest, too. With $48, I'm getting a nice payout thanks to *To the Moon*.\n\nI've exhausted all my options. I'm not going to buy anything from the shop, I don't want to reroll right now, and I have nothing to consume. I’m ready.\n\nTherefore, the action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
