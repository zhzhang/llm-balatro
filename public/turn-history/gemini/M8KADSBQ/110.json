{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action for Ante 4, Round 11: Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop with $36, facing The Arm boss. That means my Flush hands are going to be leveled down, which is bad news. I'm playing a Flush strategy, and I need to maximize my chip output to survive this round and the next. The Arm boss reduces hand levels, so a Level 2 Flush becomes Level 1.\n\nI have a solid Joker setup: Four Fingers for 4-card Flushes, To the Moon for economy, Bootstraps for scaling, Vampire for multiplicative scaling (at x2.8 currently), Zany Joker for +12 mult on 3-of-a-kind (which is less relevant to my Flush strategy), and Business Card, which gives a 1-in-2 chance for $2 on face cards.\n\nThe critical decision is between Crafty Joker (+80 Chips for Flush) and potentially a reroll. Rerolling is too expensive at $7 and I already rerolled the shop twice. Crafty Joker is on sale for $3. However, I have all 6 joker slots used, so I *must* sell a Joker to make space. The Zany Joker is effectively giving me the extra slot, but the game is showing that I have 6 joker slots (with Zany's +1 factored in).\n\nBusiness Card is the weakest link in my setup. While the potential for $2 is nice, the immediate need to survive The Arm boss is paramount. I can sell Business Card for $1, buy Crafty for $3.\n\nI've got Strength ($2) in the shop, but it's a Tarot card. I have one consumable slot open (The Sun), so I can buy it. Strength adds a rank, which can be useful in the long term, or to build Three of a Kind for Zany. However, it's not going to make a huge difference right now. Strength is a good Tarot pick, but not what I need now.\n\nThe *core* priority is to buy Crafty Joker to get +80 chips for Flushes to boost the base score and ensure I can meet the requirements to beat The Arm. I have to sell Business Card to get there. The risk of not being able to buy Crafty Joker outweighs all other options.\n\nTo the Moon and Bootstraps offer a good economy and multiplier boost respectively, but those pale in comparison to the +80 Chips of Crafty.\n\nThus, my plan is:\n\n1.  **`sell_joker 6`** (Business Card).\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [6]"}
