{"reasoning":"**Strategic Flush Optimization: Diamond Debuff Analysis**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 19, in the BLIND_SELECT phase, specifically the Boss round. The Boss here, aptly named \"The Window,\" has declared that all Diamond cards are debuffed. The goal is 70,000 chips, and I have a modest $78 to work with.\n\nMy Joker setup is currently: Zany Joker (negative, but +12 Mult on 3-of-a-kind), Bootstraps (+30 Mult, currently at $2/5$), Four Fingers (vital for 4-card Flushes), To the Moon (negative, extra interest), Seltzer (retrigger for 5 hands), Vampire (X3.5 Mult, gains from eating enhancements), Baseball Card (rare, Uncommon Jokers give X1.5 Mult), and Hallucination (negative, Tarot from booster).\n\nCrucially, I have five Uncommon Jokers – Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, and Vampire. The Baseball Card is going to be a huge multiplier here. It grants X1.5 Mult to each Uncommon. This brings the total X-Mult from Baseball Card to an impressive 7.59375.\n\nMy strategy hinges on Flushes, which I've got at Level 5, for 95 Chips and 12 Mult. Recent scores have been in the 120k-150k range with Flushes, so I can handle this. Since the Boss debuffs Diamonds, I can still make a Flush with non-Diamond cards and maintain the normal score. \"Four Fingers\" is my key to this: 4-card Flushes.\n\nThe order of Jokers matters for Mult calculation. Additive multipliers (like Bootstraps) come before multiplicative ones (Vampire, Baseball Card). Baseball Card gives X-Mult based on Uncommon Jokers, and the descriptions make it clear that the multiplier is embedded in the trigger of the Uncommon Joker.\n\nHere’s the current order I've landed on:\n1.  Zany Joker (+12 Mult if 3oak)\n2.  Bootstraps (+30 Mult)\n3.  Four Fingers (No mult)\n4.  To the Moon (No mult)\n5.  Seltzer (Retriggers cards - happens earlier during card scoring)\n6.  Vampire (X3.5 Mult)\n7.  Baseball Card (gives X1.5 to Uncommons)\n\nThis order is good. With Baseball Card, I can use each Uncommon Joker as X1.5 Mult source.\n\nSince the order of \"independent\" Jokers is left-to-right, the final sequence is:\n- (Card scoring)\n- Zany Joker (+12)\n- Bootstraps (+30)\n- Four Fingers (X1.5 from Baseball)\n- To the Moon (X1.5 from Baseball)\n- Seltzer (X1.5 from Baseball)\n- Vampire (X3.5 base, and X1.5 from Baseball)\n\nThe X-mults (X1.5, X1.5, X1.5, X3.5 \\* 1.5) are already after the Additive Mults (Zany, Bootstraps), and the current Joker order makes this work. We're now BLIND_SELECT.\n\nThe target is 70,000, and I’ve been hitting Flushes for 155,000. Debuffed Diamonds are a concern, but as long as I stick to Flushes of Spades, Hearts, or Clubs, I should be fine. With Seltzer, I'm extremely safe. I will `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
