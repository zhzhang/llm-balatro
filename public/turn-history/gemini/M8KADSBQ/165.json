{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment: Prioritizing Vampire's Power**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop (Ante 6, Round 16), with $73 to play with, and the ultimate goal is to maximize my score potential for the Big Blind and Boss Blind. My current build focuses on Flush, with a suite of Jokers: Crafty, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany, Vampire, and Seltzer. Vampire (x3.2) is the heart of my scaling; it relies on enhanced cards for X-Mult. I'm currently running a mostly maxed inventory, with 7/7 Jokers.\n\nMy initial thought is the Shop itself, Mercury and Sly Joker are immediate passes. The real choices are:\n\n*   **Standard Pack ($2):** Given the Liquidation/Clearance Sale, this is a steal. The high probability of enhanced cards or high-rank cards is perfect fodder for Vampire.\n*   **Magic Trick Voucher ($5):** Cheap and will open up more card options in future shops, which also feeds Vampire.\n*   **Reroll ($5):** Contingency option if the current shop offerings are dismal.\n\nMy plan is to grab that Standard Pack right away. It's low risk and has a high reward potential for Vampire. I'll open it to see what I get. That will change the game state to `STANDARD_PACK`. Then, I can decide if the Magic Trick or a Reroll becomes valuable. I've already determined that after the purchase, $71 is still at least $70, so Bootstraps will remain at its current Mult. I'm hitting `buy_booster` for the Standard Pack first in position 1. That leaves me with $71.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
