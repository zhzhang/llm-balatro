{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Celestial Pack Prioritization**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 2, Round 4. Got $9 in the bank. Four Jokers: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire with a x1.2 mult. I need to get ready for The Pillar boss blind, which is up next and will debuff the cards played in this Ante. I've been playing a lot of Flushes, and a Straight Flush to get some early points.\n\nThe shop's got Neptune (Straight Flush Planet, $3), Green Joker (+1 Mult per hand played, $4), a Celestial Pack ($4), and a Tarot Merchant ($10). Flush is currently level 1. I used The Hierophant on a K and J of Diamonds earlier.\n\nRight now, I have $9, and with \"To the Moon\" I'm earning an extra dollar in interest (so $2 total). \"Bootstraps\" is giving +2 Mult. I need to evaluate the choices to maximize my scoring and economy going forward.\n\nNeptune, while potentially useful, isn't a high priority because Straight Flushes are rare with my current set up, even with Four Fingers. The Green Joker is a reasonable common scaler. However, it's a discard conflict and my main scaler is Vampire. I'm focusing on \"To the Moon\" and \"Bootstraps\" for money, and \"Vampire\" for enhancements.\n\nThe Celestial Pack is the most intriguing. It could hold Jupiter, which would level up my Flushes, my main source of points.\n\nI can't afford the Tarot Merchant right now.\n\nNow, if I buy the Celestial Pack ($4), I'll have $5 left. If I skip the shop with $9, I can save the money. Buying Neptune would leave me with $6. But what about the Boss Blind? My previous hands have been a Flush, a Straight Flush, and a Flush. This means many of my Diamonds and potentially some Spades/Hearts/Clubs are debuffed by the Boss Blind. Since the shop is a bit weak for my build now, should I save money to hit the $10 threshold for better interest and Bootstraps? But even with $9 right now, I'm earning an extra dollar in interest and my \"Bootstraps\" are giving +2 Mult. I want to see if I can find Jupiter in the Celestial Pack.\n\nOkay, let's break it down: with the Celestial Pack, I'll have $5. With the pack, I'll have +2 Mult on Bootstraps and a total interest of $2. The same is true with $9 (no difference!). The next interest step is $10. So, spending $4 to potentially get Jupiter is very low risk.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to buy the Celestial Pack. If I get Jupiter, great! Even Mars or Saturn might be useful. Then I'll move to round select.\n\nI'm only using this one slot, so the Green Joker is not as useful right now.\n\n**Action: `buy_booster 1` (Celestial Pack).**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
