{"reasoning":"**Ante 8 Decision Time**\n\nOkay, here we are in Ante 8, the final stretch, and I need to make some crucial decisions. I've got $84, eight Jokers, and the boss blind is looming. My primary goal is to maximize my score.\n\nLooking at my Jokers, the synergy with Baseball Card is screaming at me. I've got a solid core of Uncommons, and the Vampire is my key damage dealer, scaling with enhancements. I am really banking on Flushes (level 6, 14 Mult, 110 chips).\n\nThe shop offers a few interesting cards: the Marble Joker, the Sly Joker, and a Standard Pack. My mind is immediately drawn to the Marble Joker. Adding a Stone card every blind will constantly trigger Vampire, and the Baseball Card will increase its mult. Currently, my five Uncommons (Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire) give me about 7.6x from Baseball Card. Adding Marble Joker would push that up to approximately 11.4x. Selling the Zany Joker (+12 Mult for 3-of-a-kind) feels like a no-brainer for this kind of multiplier.\n\nHere’s the thing: I’m at the Joker limit (8/8). I need to sell something. The negatives (Zany, Hallucination, and To the Moon) give me slots. But even so, I'm at 8/8. So I’m going to have to sell something.\n\nMy plan has emerged: I'll buy the Standard Pack first and hope Hallucination triggers. This gives me a chance at a Tarot, which could give an enhancement. Then, after that, I can sell the Zany Joker to free up a slot, and buy the Marble Joker. That's a good plan.\n\nThe interest calculation is interesting. To the Moon gives me a little extra, but it's not the game changer here. The primary focus is the Marble Joker and the Baseball Card.\n\nSo, first, let's buy that Standard Pack. I should get it because of Hallucination, which is a 50/50 shot at a Tarot.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
