{"reasoning":"**Strategic Review: Ante 5, Round 13 - A Flush and Vampire Predicament**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 5, Round 13, $60 in the bank. My hand is built around Flushes, with the Crafty Joker and Four Fingers as the core, and Zany as a backup, and Vampire for scaling. I've also got \"To the Moon\" for interest and Bootstraps boosting my mult. My primary focus is to get Vampire to scale, but I need Tarots for enhancements.\n\nThe shop is lackluster. Saturn is useless; I don't play Straights, and Golden Ticket is a distraction. Reroll is $6. With $60, I'm thinking about maximizing interest from \"To the Moon\" and Bootstraps, since every $5 is an extra $1 interest and +2 mult. At $60, I get an extra $12 interest. This means I want to keep my money and pass on the shop, at least for this round.\n\nThe next blind is coming. Based on my last round score of ~15k for the Small Blind, the Big Blind will be higher. I need to be ready. Given my Flush setup, I can expect a score of ~14k with one hand. Hieroglyph has reduced my hand count to 3, so I am likely to be able to overcome the blind. But the shop doesn't have anything better. Should I reroll? It would cost $6, and that's not worth it when the $60 gives me extra interest and Bootstrap mult.\n\nI've already rerolled once. The shop is bad. Buying Saturn is cheap ($1) but probably useless. Buying Golden Ticket is useless.\n\nI think the best play is to advance to the next round, get that massive interest bonus and mult. Maybe I can find a Tarot or Spectral pack in the next shop. And holding onto cash is very strong right now. Every $5 is +2 Mult and +$1 interest.\n\nLet me just check something. Yes, no vouchers or boosters. I *could* buy Saturn just to thin the shop for next time but that's marginal. The \"To the Moon\" interest is huge.\n\nThe shop contains Saturn (Level up Straight), and Golden Ticket (Gold cards).\n\nActually, let's look at the previous turn (136). I rerolled. I should just move on.\n\nThe levels on my hands: Flush is Level 3, Straight is level 1. If I buy Saturn, it becomes level 2. It's only $1, why not? But the main goal is to win. If I reroll again ($6), I might find something better.\n\nChecking the current state: $60, reroll is $6. Shop: Saturn, Golden Ticket.\n\nI think the efficient play is to move on and benefit from interest and Bootstraps, with my current Jokers.\n\nI have enough money, and am set up for the blind. I could `buy_and_use_consumable` to buy Saturn? It's a shop card, so I can use `buy_card` or `buy_and_use_consumable`. I can't. I'll just go with `round_select`. It also saves that $1 to contribute to interest and mult.\n\nActually, let me check the Joker order. Crafty, Bootstraps, Vampire. Chips first, then Mult before X-Mult: perfect.\n\nJoker order: Crafty (1), Four Fingers (2), To the Moon (3), Bootstraps (4), Zany (5), Vampire (6). This looks good.\n\nConclusion: Shop is mediocre. Proceed to round.\n\nI'll check the shop one more time...\n\nSaturn (Level up Straight). Golden Ticket (Gold cards). Nothing helpful. Let's save the money.\n\nDecision: `round_select`.\n\nOne more thought: reroll? $60 -> $54. Bootstraps goes from +24 to +20. Interest from $12 extra to $10. Total cost: $6 + 4 mult + $2 (interest). Not worth it.\n\nVampire needs Tarot packs. I haven't seen any. If I don't get them soon, Vampire will stall. Shop doesn't have packs.\n\nOkay, let's move on. Final decision: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
