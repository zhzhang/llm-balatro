{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Early Game: A Strategic Hold**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the SHOP phase of Round 1, Ante 1. Currently, I've got a measly $2. My key possession? Four Fingers, an Uncommon Joker, which, while offering $3 if sold, is crucial for early hand flexibility. I've also got a few potentially powerful cards in hand thanks to that Spectral pack, specifically holding onto Gold and Steel cards. My goal is to maximize their value.\n\nThe shop is tempting: a Green Joker for +1 Mult per hand, and a Buffoon Pack for potential upgrades, both priced at $4. I could sell Four Fingers to afford either, but that feels risky right now. Four Fingers makes flushes and straights super easy, and given the enhanced card strategy I've got going, sacrificing that early utility for a gamble doesn't seem optimal.\n\nI can't afford anything directly, and rerolling is out of the question as well.  The Telescope voucher is completely out of reach. With the Boss Blind coming up, I need that money! My hand is overflowing, and while the hand size might be exceeding limits due to Spectral packs, the game will sort itself out for now.\n\nConsidering my situation, the wisest move is to advance to the next round with `round_select`. This is the only way I can earn more money without making a short-sighted trade.\n\nHere's the JSON representing my action: `{\"action\": \"round_select\", \"positions\": null, \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`. No fancy play here; just a strategic hold for a stronger hand down the road.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
