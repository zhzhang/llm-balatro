{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization for Maximum Score**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. We're in Ante 6, Shop phase, and it's time to refine this Joker setup. My immediate focus is on maximizing multiplier potential with what I have. Given the state of the game, here's what I'm thinking:\n\nFirst, the Baseball Card is *key*. It applies an x1.5 multiplier to all Uncommon Jokers. We have a solid spread of Uncommons, each with their own functions. Zany Joker is also in play for the Three of a Kind. The game logic suggests that Common jokers won't trigger the Baseball card mult. I'm playing Flushes, so I can only trigger the Zany Joker by keeping cards in hand or playing a \"Flush House\" or \"Flush Five\".\n\nThe current Joker positions are suboptimal. To get the best results, I'm going to re-arrange. Since +Mult is most effective when it is at the very left, I need to place my +Mult Jokers at the front, with Zany and Bootstraps as top priority. I want Zany Joker (Common) to be the leftmost. Since Baseball Card has the \"Uncommon Jokers each give X1.5 Mult\" effect, that means all Uncommon multipliers must go after it.\n\nBased on this logic, I need to order them in the following sequence: Zany Joker (Common +Mult), Bootstraps (Uncommon +Mult), Four Fingers (Uncommon), To the Moon (Uncommon), Seltzer (Uncommon), Vampire (Uncommon xMult). Baseball Card is placed at the end. After the rearrangement, I'll see if a reroll is worthwhile to improve my hand.\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [4,3,1,2,6,5,7]"}
