{"reasoning":"**My Shop Phase Decision**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 4, Round 11. I've got $50, the reroll is $5, and I have a decent set of Jokers: Four Fingers for flush/straight potential, To the Moon for interest (which is currently $20, I need to keep that in mind), Bootstraps for some scaling mult, Vampire for my enhanced cards, and Zany Joker... that negative joker adds a slot.  I also have The Sun for Heart conversions. My hand levels are decent too, Straight Flush and Flush at level 2.\n\nThe shop has only one thing: Business Card for $3. It's on sale. That should be cheap. My strategy is clearly flush/straight flush, scaling Vampire and Bootstraps. The Business Card could generate some extra cash, which could be beneficial for economy, which will help me scale Vampire.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the interest. I have $50. To the Moon should give me $20 in interest per round, which should put me above $25 in interest. \n\nNow, back to the Business Card. It's cheap, just $3, and it could give me a small boost. My main consideration is whether this is the best use of my money or if I should reroll or just move on to the next round. Rerolling costs $5. My current Jokers are good and Vampire is key. I have to think about the long game.\n\nI need to quickly figure out my open joker slots. Okay, so Zany Joker is negative, but it adds a slot, so my current jokers are: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Vampire, and Zany Joker. So, Zany Joker doesn't count against my max of 6. I've used 4 regular slots, and I have 2 free slots. Buying the Business Card is completely safe.\n\nIs the card worth the $3? I could use that $3 to reroll for better Jokers or Tarot packs, but I have to think about keeping my money above $25 to maximize interest.\n\nGiven everything, I'm going to buy the Business Card and then consider my options after. That's the best approach: buy the card and then re-evaluate. I will buy the card.\n\nAction: buy_card 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
