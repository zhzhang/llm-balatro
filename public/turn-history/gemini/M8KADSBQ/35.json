{"reasoning":"**Strategic Hand Analysis and Discard Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2, Round 4 (Big Blind). The goal is 1200 chips, and I have zero. I have $5 and these Jokers: Four Fingers (4-card flushes/straights), To the Moon (Interest), Bootstraps (+2 Mult per $5, current +2), and Vampire (X0.1 Mult per enhanced card scored, removes enhancement, current X1).\n\nMy current hand has an Ace, King, and 10 of Spades, a 9 of Hearts (Gold), 6 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, a King of Diamonds, and a Stone Card. I have four hands remaining and two discards.\n\nThe priority is 1200 chips. Vampire can scale, but I need enhanced cards to score. I have a Gold card (9 of Hearts) and a Stone Card (enhancements). Four Fingers lets me make a flush with only four cards. I need to find a fourth Spade and trigger Vampire a couple of times. I must discard the \"fluff.\"\n\nI have a history of discards: `discard 6 7 8` (KC, QC, 6D) and then `discard 5 6 7` (7H, 6H, 9D). Let's review the current hand and the desired outcomes.\n\nI'm focused on a 4-card Spade Flush, aided by Four Fingers.  I've got three Spades, so the plan is to discard the non-Spades to make a 4-card flush, and then hopefully score the Stone Card (for a Vampire boost). The 9H is a tricky situation. It's gold, but in a Flush, the heart does not score unless it's *part* of the Flush. \n\nSo, I have to consider the scoring rules. The +chips values ONLY count if the card is part of the highest hand played. The Stone card *always* scores, so that's easy.\n\nIf I make a Flush of Spades (Four Cards), and include the Stone Card, the total is 35 chips + (11+10+10+Spade) = ~70-80.\nWith a multiplier of 4 + 2 = 6: 80 * 6 = 480 chips. Add the Stone: 80+50 = 130 chips. 130 * 6 = 780. And then Vampire at X1.1 (from Stone) = 858.\n\nI'll easily reach 1200 with four hands.\n\nSo the plan:  I discard the non-spades:  6 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, and King of Diamonds.\n\nThere are 11 Spades remaining in the deck and 43 total cards.  The probability of drawing a Spade is decent.\n\nI have 2 discards, so this must be right: Discard 5, 6, and 7.\n\nOkay, that seems right.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7]"}
