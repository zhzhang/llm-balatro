{"reasoning":"**Strategic Big Blind Play: A Calculated Approach**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 8, Round 21, Big Blind – the target is a manageable 75,000 chips. My last Flush hand scored almost 500k, so this should be easy. I'm sitting on a decent setup: Bootstraps for the raw mult, then a string of multipliers with To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire (which will get a nice boost from the Baseball Card), and finally Marble Joker. I have $82, a Tower consumable, and the boss is the Crimson Heart, which disables a random Joker. The current goal is to hit 75k in this round.\n\nThe core question is: Play or Skip? Skipping gives a Spectral pack, but I value shop access and Vampire scaling here much more at this ante level. Given I am sitting at the Blind Select screen, skipping is not a priority.\n\nI'm focused on maximizing my Joker setup before the boss battle. Marble Joker needs to trigger here by playing the blind. I can use the tower consumable on a Stone card to further boost Vampire. Given I'm at the Blind Select screen, Marble Joker will trigger once I press `play_round`. The current setup is near optimal for scaling: Bootstraps (+32), To the Moon (X1.5), Seltzer (X1.5), Vampire (X3.7 * X1.5), Baseball Card (global), Hallucination (nothing), and Marble Joker (X1.5).\n\nSo, `play_round` it is. It's the standard move: maximize Stone card usage, gain some money and get to the shop before that boss. The risk of skipping for a Spectral pack isn't worth it when the current goal is so attainable. I'm going to trigger that Marble Joker and get the show on the road. The current arrangement of the Jokers will trigger the Baseball card's bonus effect, and then the Stone cards will further scale the Vampire. I also have 7 jokers, which means the Crimson Heart (boss) has a lower chance of ruining my Vampire, or Baseball Card, set. Let's go.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
