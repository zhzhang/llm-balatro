{"reasoning":"**My Planet Pack Decision: A Calculated Flush**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase, and it's Planet Pack selection time. Got $65 to play with, and a decent suite of Jokers: Crafty for Flush bonuses, Four Fingers for those easy Straight Flushes and Flushes, To the Moon (ugh, extra interest), Bootstraps for the multiplier boost, and Zany for the Three of a Kind bonus, and Vampire to get even more multiplier. Let's see, what are the Vouchers? Liquidation, Clearance Sale, and Hieroglyph.\n\nMy game plan has been revolving around Flushes and 3OAKs, particularly because of Crafty and Four Fingers. My Flushes are at Level 2, so are Straight Flushes. I’ve been playing Flushes like crazy – it's my go-to.\n\nI've got three options: Saturn, Neptune, and Jupiter. Saturn levels up Straights (I barely use them). Neptune boosts Straight Flushes (which I'm leaning into with Four Fingers), but Jupiter is looking juicy because it specifically improves Flushes. Right now, Jupiter levels up Flush, which is, at level 2, worth 50 Chips and 6 Mult, to level 3, which is worth 65 Chips, and 8 mult.\n\nWhile the Straight Flush bump from Neptune (140 chips, 12 mult to 180 chips, 16 mult) seems tempting because it can be relatively easy to get because of Four Fingers, it's about reliability here. Those Flushes are my consistent earners. I've got Vampire to multiply that mult and Bootstraps to make it insane, so boosting my most frequent hand will maximize those joker effects.\n\nLet's do a quick numbers check... Yes, Jupiter. It's the most reliable play.\n\nOkay, let's see. Action: `select 3`. And the numbers. Money: $65. Bootstraps: +26 Mult ($65 / 5 * 2). Interest: (To the Moon) Base is usually $5, so, with $65, I am getting $18 per round, that's insane.\n\nBoost those Flushes. Yep. Let's select! Let me double check... Yes, `select 3`. Jupiter it is.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
