{"reasoning":"**Current Turn Analysis**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 3, $30 in the bank. The goal is to beat the game, reach Ante 8. The current build is flush-focused (Four Fingers), with scaling from money (Bootstraps, To the Moon) and card enhancements (Vampire).\n\nMy priorities are clear: feed Vampire (X2.0 Multiplier) with enhancements, source those enhancements, and maintain enough cash for interest and Bootstraps' multiplier.\n\nI have one open Joker slot and two open consumable slots. I've got \"Four Fingers,\" \"To the Moon,\" \"Bootstraps,\" and \"Vampire\" Jokers in play. My hand level is currently a Level 2 Flush (50 Chips, 6 Mult). I also have a Hieroglyph Voucher for -1 Ante, -1 hand.\n\nHere's the shop: Juggler ($4), Arcana Pack ($4), Standard Pack ($4), and Director's Cut ($10). Jupiter was bought on the previous turn.\n\nThe key decision is what to buy. Arcana Packs are the primary source of Tarot cards, so I'm thinking I'll buy an Arcana Pack ($4) and feed Vampire. That'll drop me to $26, but will still maximize the interest and Bootstraps (+10 Mult) bonuses. Currently, interest is $1 per $5, and with 'To the Moon' it's $2. Losing that $2 Multi is worth the X-Mult the Vampire will gain.\n\nLet's make sure I'm thinking clearly. Buying Arcana Pack ($4) and feeding Vampire is currently a priority. I can buy the Arcana Pack for $4. I'll have $26 remaining after this.\n\nThe Juggler is not that great in comparison. Juggler is okay for finding cards, but it takes a Joker slot. I have one slot left and will not use it this turn. Standard Pack is also not the best. Arcana packs give me the specific enhancement needed for Vampire.\n\nI'm confident in my course of action. I will buy the Arcana Pack at position 1. That should feed the Vampire, and start to build an edge. The final action: `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
