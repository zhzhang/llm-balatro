{"reasoning":"**Round 22 Shop Analysis**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 8, aiming for the final boss. I've got $63, and the goal is to secure the win with the current hand. My Jokers are pretty solid: Bootstraps (+24 Mult), To the Moon (Negative, +Interest, +1 slot), Vampire (X3.9 Mult), Baseball Card (Rare, Uncommon Jokers give X1.5), Hallucination (Negative Common, Tarot chance, +1 slot), Marble Joker (Uncommon, Stone card gen, +50 chips), and Ice Cream (+100 Chips). I'm running Flush level 8, which is good for 140 chips and 18 mult.\n\nThe shop offers a 10 of Spades and a Half Joker. Not worth it. Reroll costs $9, which could hurt Bootstraps. Considering my past performance, I can comfortably beat the boss. The current deck's potential is easily reaching the needed score. No need to fish for anything in the shop.\n\nLet's do a quick breakdown: Marble Joker and Vampire are a nice combo, with the Marble Joker generating Stone cards, and Vampire scaling nicely by consuming them.\n\nThe Joker scoring order is Chips > Card Chips > Card Mult > Joker Additive Mult > Joker Multiplicative Mult, which is critical for making sure the effects are applied correctly.\n\nI have to carefully evaluate the current Joker order based on how the unique bonuses apply. My current arrangement is:\n\n1.  Bootstraps (+24 Mult)\n2.  To the Moon (Uncommon)\n3.  Vampire (Uncommon, X3.9)\n4.  Baseball Card\n5.  Hallucination\n6.  Marble Joker (Uncommon)\n7.  Ice Cream (+100 Chips)\n\nThe Baseball Card is the lynchpin, as it's the main multiplier for the Uncommons. The X1.5 triggers from the Baseball card *for each* uncommon Joker. The core logic is to get the additive mult from Bootstraps as early as possible. That is already implemented. The Vampire Joker is the xMult, so this is good. The Stone cards from Marble Joker will keep that mult up.\n\nChecking the exact execution: The order is right! The additive mult (Bootstraps) happens before the multiplicative ones. The X1.5 multiplier will cascade in the right order. Bootstraps first, then the XMults, so the most efficient mult gain happens.\n\nThe current order ensures the bonuses stack correctly: Stone card generation, additive mult, multiplicative mult.\n\nSo, since all the bonuses are stacking in the correct order, I will skip the shop and just proceed to the round. The current hand is more than strong enough to get the win. I can win this.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
