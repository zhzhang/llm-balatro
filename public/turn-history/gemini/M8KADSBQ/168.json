{"reasoning":"**The Shop Reroll Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so I'm in round 16 of the shop phase with $66 and some killer Jokers: Crafty (Flush), Four Fingers (4-card Flush/Straight), To the Moon (extra interest and slot), Bootstraps (+2 Mult per $5, currently at +26), Zany (3OAK), Vampire (X3.2 mult scaling on enhanced), and Seltzer (retrigger). My primary goal is to maximize score for the Big Blind/Boss. My Jokers are all filled.\n\nI've got a Magic Trick voucher in my hand, meaning the shop can now display playing cards. Currently, the shop cards are Mercury (lvl Pair) and Sly Joker (Pair). Neither are particularly useful. Rerolling ($5) is an option to potentially find something better (like an enhanced card for Vampire or a Jupiter). Given the Magic Trick voucher, I'm leaning toward a reroll, since the shop could now contain playing cards that are useful for Vampire scaling. The shop is empty of boosters.\n\nI'm thinking hard about the current interest calculation. \"To the Moon\" is paying extra interest. With $66, I'm getting a massive return. At this moment, $66 divided by $5 gives 13 interest and multiplied by 2, because of To the Moon, which gives a $26 interest.\n\nI could also just select the next round, but if I reroll, I could find a card that will make Vampire more effective. I have Seltzer, which is very powerful for scaling Vampire, if I find enhanced cards.\n\nSince I have the Magic Trick voucher, there's a strong probability that a playing card or Planet/Tarot pack will appear. Rerolling is probably worth it, and I should do it now.\n\nLet's check the shop items again: Mercury, Sly Joker. Reroll cost: $5. Rerolling.\n\nThe ideal is to reroll the shop.\nThe resulting JSON is `{\"action\": \"reroll_shop\", \"positions\": null, \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
