{"reasoning":"**Current Plan for the Big Blind**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Big Blind, needing 3000 chips. My hand right now is: Jack of Spades, 3 of Spades, 2 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Queen of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, and Queen of Diamonds. I have a few Jokers – Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire – plus \"The Lovers\" consumable, which is key. My main goal is to scale up the Vampire Joker.\n\nThe strategy here is pretty straightforward: Flushes and Straights are the name of the game, thanks to Four Fingers.  Vampire gives a small bonus every time a *scoring enhanced* card is played, but then *removes* the enhancement.  I've got a good starting hand for a Flush with four Hearts (Ace, Queen, 10, 9).\n\nThe key is \"The Lovers.\" I need to use it to enhance a card *and then* play that card as part of a scoring hand, the key to scaling Vampire. So here's the thought process: I have a 4-card Flush ready to go with the Hearts. I need to make one more card Wild. Four Fingers lets me make a flush with only 4 cards, but I need to make sure I score the enhanced card.\n\nLet's use \"The Lovers\" on the Jack of Spades (position 1) to make it a Wild Card. Then, I can play the Jack of Spades (Wild) with the four Hearts in positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 for a 5-card Flush. Playing that flush will score the enhanced card (the now-Wild Jack). The Vampire Joker's multiplier will increase by X0.1, and the Wild Card status will be removed.\n\nThe final action is: `use_consumable 1 1`. This uses the \"The Lovers\" (position 1 in inventory) on the Jack of Spades (position 1 in hand). This gives us:\n\n*   Action: `use_consumable`\n*   Positions: `[1, 1]`\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,1]"}
