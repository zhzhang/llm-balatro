{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante 8 Shop**\n\nOkay, here we go, final stretch. Ante 8, round 21. Gotta maximize score potential for these last few hands. I'm sitting on $86 after that sweet Flush. Let's see what the shop has to offer.\n\nFirst, the Jokers. Got my core lineup: Zany for 3-of-a-kind, Bootstraps for that sweet money mult, Four Fingers for easy flushes, To the Moon for a little extra cash, Seltzer for those crucial retriggers, Vampire for scaling, and Baseball Card boosting all the Uncommon jokers. The Baseball Card is key here, boosting the hell out of my other Jokers. With 5 Uncommons, that's a serious multiplier. Plus, got the three negative Jokers in the lineup, all working together.\n\nNow for the shop: Marble Joker looks interesting - a Stone card on blind select. That pairs nicely with Vampire, but the Marble Joker is uncommon too, adding to Baseball Card's X1.5. However, I have 8 Jokers. Max Jokers is 8, so I can't buy Marble Joker without selling something. Do I really want to swap? Nope, nothing's worth it right now. Zany, To the Moon, and Hallucination, my negative Jokers, don't take slots, and I only have 5 spots. I am good on the Joker situation.\n\nThe booster packs are tempting. Celestial Pack to maybe level up my flush and Standard Pack for more card density or that sweet, sweet enhancement. Plus, I could trigger Hallucination for a Tarot card, which is always nice.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'm going to buy the Celestial Pack. It's only $2, and it could make my flushes even stronger. The Standard Pack is also nice to help with my Vampire scaling, but right now I need the Celestial pack for the hand I am running with.\n\nOne last check: $86 money, Hallucination is ready, max consumables are 2. Time for the Celestial Pack. Let's make it count. `buy_booster` at position 1. And that should be it.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
