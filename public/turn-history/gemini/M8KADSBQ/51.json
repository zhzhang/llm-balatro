{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Jumbo Spectral Pack**\n\nOkay, here we go. We're in Ante 3, Round 5 with $7 in the bank. Got a decent Joker setup: Four Fingers for easy Flushes, To the Moon for interest, Bootstraps for some extra Mult, and Vampire. The key here is scaling that Vampire joker; it's the engine.\n\nThe choices: Cryptid, Aura, Sigil, and Incantation. Cryptid is out because I don't have anything worth duplicating, and it does nothing for Vampire. Aura is tempting with the Editions (Foil, Holographic, Polychrome), but those *aren't* Enhancements, which is what the Vampire feeds on. Sigil is a quick play for Four Fingers, but it's a gamble for a full hand of one suit and doesn't synergize with Vampire.\n\nIncantation is the play! I need those enhanced cards. While I could lose a good card, gaining four random *enhanced* cards – specifically what Vampire consumes – is a huge boost to the Joker. Even if I lose the King of Spades, that's fine. It fuels the Vampire. Money is tight, so this is a \"free\" power spike from the pack, rather than spending money for Tarot Cards.\n\nSo, the command will be `select 4`. Just the pack position. Incantation doesn't need a target; it's random. The goal is to maximize the Vampire. I checked again, and the *Incantation* description perfectly fits the Vampire's description (\"removes card Enhancement\"). Cryptid is not good. Aura adds editions. Incantation is a perfect match. I even looked at my current hand - Jack of Spades and King of Spades - no help for this round.\n\nThe positions are: 1. Cryptid, 2. Aura, 3. Sigil, and 4. Incantation.\n\nAction: `select` Positions: `[4]`.\n\nIncantation it is.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
