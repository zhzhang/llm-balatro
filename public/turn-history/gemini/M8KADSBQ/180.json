{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Analysis and Strategy**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. It's Ante 6, Round 17, and I'm in the shop phase with $59. My core strategy revolves around Flushes, using Crafty and Four Fingers to maximize chip gain. I'm scaling with Vampire for that sweet multiplier and Bootstraps for the money-based mult, and supporting with Seltzer for the retrigger. My immediate goal is the upcoming Ante 6 boss.\n\nThe shop offers two cards: a Clever Joker (irrelevant for my Flush strategy) and The Hanged Man, a Tarot card for only $1 that destroys two cards. It's a no-brainer to buy the Hanged Man at the bargain price. I have plenty of money, and deck thinning is always valuable. It'll go into the consumable slot.\n\nI know my vampire will be hungry for upgrades later so my eyes are scanning for packs. The real question is whether to reroll the shop immediately. Reroll costs $7, and while that reduces my Bootstraps multiplier, I'm well above the interest cap. The benefit from the re-roll might present another card with higher value (like another pack), so I will consider that in my decision.\n\nNow, how about the boss fight? The last flush was around 25k, but the Ante 6 boss usually demands a much higher score, potentially 60k to 100k, depending on difficulty. With Seltzer active, I can potentially double (or more) my score. Let me estimate.\n\n*   Base Flush (Level 5): 95 Chips / 12 Mult.\n*   Crafty: +80 Chips.\n*   Four Cards: Let's assume average rank 7 (7+7+7+7 = 28 chips).\n*   Total Chips: 95 + 80 + 28 = 203 chips. Seltzer will retrigger the 28 chips: 203 + 28= 231.\n*   Bootstraps: +22 Mult.\n*   Zany: (If Four Fingers results in 3 of a kind) +12 Mult. Total: 12 + 22 + 12 = 46.\n*   Vampire: X3.3.\n*   Total Score: 231 * 46 * 3.3 = ~35,000.\n\nI need more scaling, and the best way to get it is to go fishing in the shop for booster packs. I'll buy Hanged Man first, as planned. Then I'll reroll and go for boosters.\n\nAlright, the action plan is simple: `buy_card 2`. That's it.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
