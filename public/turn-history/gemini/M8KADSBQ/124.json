{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment: Buy \"The Devil\"**\n\nOkay, I'm ready to make a move. I've got $36. My initial thought, based on my understanding of this build, is to buy \"The Devil\" from the shop. It's a Tarot card that, if I use it on a card in my hand, will turn it into a Gold card. Since I'm running the Vampire Joker, which gains multiplier based on Enhanced cards played, \"The Devil\" directly increases the Vampire's power. It only costs $1 due to the discount, leaving me with $35.\n\nI need to confirm the interest calculation. \"To the Moon\" gives me $2 interest per $5, which is what I'm currently working with. So, $35 / $5 = 7, 7 * $2 = $14 interest. Purchasing \"The Devil\" doesn't change that interest calculation.\n\nShould I consider the Green Joker? It's +1 Mult per hand, -1 per discard. I have a spare joker slot, but I'm in Ante 5, and this seems too slow for my current engine. My focus is Vampire.\n\nNow I am certain, I'll buy \"The Devil\". Since the purchase will complete, I will have the Tarot in my inventory. Then, I'll have 2 consumables (Strength and The Devil). I can proceed to the Round Select phase. I shouldn't reroll, since the cost is $5 and I'd still have $30, which still means $12 interest.\n\nJust making sure, let me check again if I need to rearrange my jokers.\n\nHere's my current setup:\n1: Crafty Joker (+80 Chips if Flush)\n2: Four Fingers (4 cards for Flush/Straight)\n3: To the Moon (Negative, +1 slot, Interest)\n4: Bootstraps (+2 Mult per $5)\n5: Zany Joker (Negative, +1 slot, +12 Mult if 3OAK)\n6: Vampire (x2.9 Mult)\n\nThe order of Jokers is correct for my strategy. I want to add chips/mult before multiplications.\n\nTherefore, the action is `buy_card 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
