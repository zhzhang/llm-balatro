{"reasoning":"**A Calculated Gambit: Facing The Arm**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 4, Boss: The Arm. The Arm’s going to mess with my hand level, so I need to make the most of what I have. I’ve got $34. My current hand is heavy on Flushes (Level 2), so that first play needs to be absolutely killer, otherwise it's just Level 1 and 4 Mult.\n\nFirst, the Jokers. I need to make sure they're in the right order. I've got a killer combination: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Vampire, Zany, and Crafty Joker. But the order… that's where the magic is. Gotta remember the rule: Chip Jokers first, then additive multipliers, then *finally* the multiplicative ones. And Zany needs to trigger *before* Vampire for maximum impact, especially if I can score a Flush House, which I think I can.\n\nCrafty Joker is a must, so it goes first. Then, Four Fingers is good to set me up, then To the Moon. Bootstraps and Zany before Vampire. So, the ideal order is Crafty, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany, Vampire.\n\nThe shop. Strength? It’s only $2. It won’t *directly* boost Vampire (no enhancements available), but it might help me get a 3-of-a-kind. Since I can get a Flush House with Four Fingers, that's crucial. I'll buy Strength for the next round. But first, let’s get my Jokers lined up. I have The Sun too, so I'm set for Flushes.\n\nMy strategy? A Flush House with Four Fingers plus Strength to stack the odds. Crafty and Zany will bring in a huge score. So I'll go for it. Then, I need to rearrange jokers and buy Strength.\n\nNow, let's execute. First, buy Strength. Then, rearrange the Jokers, and go.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
