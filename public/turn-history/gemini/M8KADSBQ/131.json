{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase: Evaluating Options for Maximum Impact**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 13, Ante 5/8. I've got $50. Time to make some critical decisions in the shop. I've got a solid Joker lineup: Crafty for Flush, Four Fingers for Flush/Straights, To the Moon for interest (though I need to double-check that extra interest calculation), Bootstraps for Multiplier, Zany, and Vampire for that crucial x3 multiplier. The current vouchers are empty.\n\nFirst thing's first, I need to maximize my immediate power. I have 6/7 Joker slots filled. The descriptions of the shop items are:\n\n*   **Joker Stencil**: Is it worth the $4 to increase multiplier based on *empty* slots? I'll have to come back to this.\n*   **Wily Joker**: $2 for a chip boost on 3 of a Kind, which I often make.\n*   **Celestial Pack**: Always a solid option for card enhancement.\n*   **Jumbo Spectral Pack**: At $3, this is the first item that piques my interest.\n\nI have to choose between getting an immediate power-up and gambling on the future. I have $50 and will want to purchase at least one item. Here's my thought process:\n\nI could buy the Jumbo Spectral Pack. These packs have a chance to add significant value (Aura, Hex, etc). For just $3, it's a steal. I may want to buy Wily Joker after to round out my build. The spectral cards can change the game, so it's the more risky-but-potentially-rewarding option.\n\nI could also buy the Wily Joker. It has good synergy with my Flush/3 of a Kind strategy. Wily is $2, which would put me at $48. But, I am leaning toward the spectral pack.\n\nI could also buy the Celestial Pack. It's only $2, and could improve my Flush or 3OAK.\n\nLet me analyze the Spectral Pack contents, just to make sure:\n*   **Aura**: Apply foil, holo, or polychrome to a card. Potentially powerful.\n*   **Hex**: Randomly add Polychrome to a Joker and destroy others. This has potential with my Vampire joker.\n*   **Ectoplasm**: Add Negative tag to a joker and -1 hand size. This has high risk as it's negative.\n*   **Immolate**: Destroy 5 cards, get $20. Nice money boost.\n*   **Grim/Incantation/Talisman**: Creates cards. Could be good.\n*   **Ankh**: Create copy of Joker. This has high risk as it will likely destroy my other Jokers.\n*   **Ouija**: All cards become one rank and -1 hand size. Potentially bad.\n\nAlright, the Jumbo Spectral Pack is a good deal at $3. It's a steal, so I need to go for this first.\n\nI have a 6/7 filled slots. I *could* buy the Wily joker, but that'll consume a slot. I have to think about my purchase options and what will give the best value now and in the future.\n\nBuying the Spectral pack first, is a no-brainer. Let's do this first.\n\n**Action**: `buy_booster 2`.\n\nJust to double check, I have $50, which gives +20 Multiplier via Bootstraps, which will drop to +18 if I buy the pack, but the pack has more value. I still like the spectral pack. My priority should be *now*.\n\nI should not buy Wily Joker until after the pack. I may get effects (like Ankh or Hex) that require specific Jokers. The Spectral pack has higher upside overall. I have no shop cards or shop boosters.\n\nI'll buy the Spectral pack.\n\nWait, I should confirm the *next* action. I played a Flush last turn.\n\nOkay, let's stick with the Spectral pack.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nAction: `buy_booster`\nPositions: `[2]` (Jumbo Spectral Pack)\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
