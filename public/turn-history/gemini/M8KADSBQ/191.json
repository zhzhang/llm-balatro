{"reasoning":"**Ante Up: Vampire's Gotta Eat**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 7/8, Round 18. I'm in the shop, staring at this Standard Pack. Got $56 in the bank, and my inventory is looking decent with a few Uncommon Jokers – Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer – plus Zany, and the all-important Baseball Card. Then there's Vampire, my current scaling engine. I also have \"The Hanged Man\" and \"Justice\" to throw into the mix.\n\nThe goal? Build score, specifically leverage Vampire. Vampire gets +0.1 Mult for each enhanced card *played*. The choices are: a Jack, an 8, a Glass King of Spades, a Gold 6 of Diamonds, and an Ace. The glass King gives 2x Mult which the vampire will happily take, and the gold 6 gives money when held, which is less useful given \"To the Moon\".\n\nOkay, focusing on Vampire. I have a X3.3 Mult and this Glass King of Spades or Gold 6 of Diamonds. The Glass Card is the clear winner for Vampire. Remember, Vampire *consumes* the enhancement, which is the point here: permanent scaling. If I play it, the Vampire gets +0.1 Mult. It doesn't matter that the glass card would break; it's getting eaten. The King of Spades has a higher rank, which is good. The Gold card only pays out money if I hold it. Holding doesn't feed Vampire, and I need to scale.\n\nThere's no point in the standard cards, so it comes down to position 3: King of Spades (Glass), or position 4: Gold 6 of Diamonds. King of Spades it is! I have \"Four Fingers\" (Flushes/Straights with 4 cards), \"Seltzer\" (Retrigger all cards for 6 hands), and \"Baseball Card\" (X1.5 for Uncommon Jokers). My Uncommon Jokers give X1.5. This means that with Baseball Card, each of the five Uncommon Jokers gives a X1.5 boost. It's a scaling combo!\n\nSo, the play is obvious. Time to `select 3`. No target is necessary, just add the card to the deck. This is the move; it's the best Vampire food. No need to overthink it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
