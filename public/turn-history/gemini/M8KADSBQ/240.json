{"reasoning":"**Mid-Game Optimization: Ante 8 Boss Prep**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 21, the end-game is almost here, and I need to really solidify my build for this Ante 8 boss. I've got $85 burning a hole in my pocket, and the shop is staring me down. My current Joker setup is pretty solid, but there's definite room for improvement. I have six Jokers out of a possible seven, with one open slot.\n\nMy core strategy is centered around this **Baseball Card** Joker, which is multiplying my Uncommon Jokers. Currently, I have **Bootstraps**, **To the Moon**, **Seltzer**, and **Vampire** Jokers in play, for a nice 5.06x multiplier from the Baseball Card.\n\nI'm eyeing that **Marble Joker** in the shop, though. It's only $3, and it's an Uncommon, which is perfect to increase the Uncommon count, pushing the Baseball Card multiplier. With the Marble Joker, I'll have five Uncommons for a total multiplier of 7.59x from the Baseball Card. Plus, the Marble Joker will add Stone cards, which will directly scale my **Vampire** Joker - it's a win-win! I've also got the **Tower** card on hand, so I can use it to create an enhancement on a card, immediately benefitting the Vampire.\n\nI just need to confirm I have enough money, and that I can buy the Marble Joker. Looks like it's within budget, and I do have space available so I am going to buy it! The action is \"buy_card\", with the positions as [1].\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
