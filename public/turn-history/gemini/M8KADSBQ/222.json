{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Final Blind: A Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 8, the final ante, with $84 left. It's `STANDARD_PACK` time, and the goal is simple: maximize that final score. Let's break this down. My Joker lineup is interesting: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination. We're running a strong Uncommon engine with the Baseball Card to boost it further. The Devil consumable adds another layer.\n\nVampire is at X3.5, which is quite nice. Now, I have to figure out the best card choice. I have to select one from three cards: a Steel 10 of Clubs, a standard King of Diamonds, or a Mult King of Hearts. The Vampire wants enhancements for +0.1 per scoring enhanced card.\n\nInitially, my instinct was to grab the Mult card for Vampire fodder. But a Steel card provides X1.5 while in hand, and Vampire doesn't eat Steel cards in hand, only if played. Since we're in the final round, keeping a powerful card in hand for a massive multiplier might be the winning play.\n\nI need to make sure I don't get the \"Failed Action\" error again, like last turn. I remember it was due to Joker limits. This is a `STANDARD_PACK`, so I select a card for my deck, not a joker. So no worries here.\n\nLooking back, I've been playing Flushes. I don't know my deck composition, but if I were building on the Flush, I'd pick a card of the same suit.\n\nOkay, let's step back for a second and look at the play. Vampire's already strong at X3.5. Getting a Steel card in hand for the final blow could be clutch. Plus, remember I have *The Devil* consumable. If I choose to play this Steel card, I should use it *on* a card to feed Vampire, which could be massive. But I'll need to double-check that \"1\" is indeed the Steel 10 of Clubs. Yes, it is.\n\nGiven I'm near the end, taking a Steel card is likely to be the highest-scoring move right now. I'll focus on getting the Steel card in hand for maximum effect.\n\nAlright, I'm confident. The plan is to select the 10 of Clubs. The command is `select 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
