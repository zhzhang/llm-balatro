{"reasoning":"**Initial Run Strategy: Uncommon Tag vs. Early Economy**\n\nOkay, here we are, just starting this run (Ante 1, Round 0). Small Blind is on, 300 chips. I've got $4 in my pocket. The interesting choice is whether to play the Small Blind, or to skip it.\n\nPlaying the Small Blind *usually* is the way to go early on, to build my economy and get a peek at the shop, but the \"Skip Reward\" is a juicy Uncommon Tag - a free Uncommon Joker in the next shop!\n\nNow, if I play the Small Blind, I get $3 as a reward (plus potential interest, if any – let me check that again. Ah, yes, \"Reward: $3\"). So I'll be at $7, plus whatever I win in the hand, which will be fairly standard to get through.\n\nBut if I skip? Well, skipping means I jump straight to the Big Blind, which I can beat as well, then I get the Uncommon Tag. A free Uncommon Joker early game can really shape the whole run.\n\nHmm. Okay, let's step back. Ignoring the specifics of this situation, skipping the first Small Blind for a strong tag like this is often a good strategy if it's a good tag.\n\nSo, let's re-evaluate. I have $4. If I play, I get $7. If I skip, I get the Uncommon Tag. To be certain, an Uncommon Joker for free in the next shop is probably the best approach.\n\nLet me think… the commands are `skip_round` and `play_round`. Easy enough.\n\nGiven the options, I think I'm leaning toward the Uncommon Tag.\n\nI'm skipping the Small Blind for the Uncommon Tag because a guaranteed Uncommon Joker can define a run much better than the $3 I'd get from playing the round. The 300 chips or the 450 chips are both very beatable. Let's go for it!\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
