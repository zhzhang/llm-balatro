{"reasoning":"**Celestial Pack Analysis - Round 14**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 5/8, and this Celestial Pack is coming up. My inventory is looking solid: Crafty Joker for those sweet Flush payouts, Four Fingers to make Straight Flushes a lot easier, To the Moon to keep the interest train rolling, Bootstraps for some solid early Multiplier scaling, Zany Joker (gotta love that 3OAK potential, even with the negative!), and Vampire, which is already a solid multiplier boost. Six Jokers out of a possible seven, not bad. Cash at $74.\n\nThe pack gives me Pluto (High Card), Earth (Full House), and Neptune (Straight Flush). Hmm. My Flush build is strong – Level 3 Flush is already at 65 chips and 8 multiplier. Straight Flush is only Level 2, Full House is Level 1, and High Card is just sad at Level 1.\n\nPluto is tempting, but a Level 2 High Card? Pass. Earth and Full House? Not quite as strong as the obvious Flush potential. However, the Straight Flush is already at a pretty solid Level 2, which gives 40 Chips and +4 Multiplier. Now, with Four Fingers, that Straight Flush is actually quite achievable. It's a riskier play, but a Straight Flush is a *major* payout upgrade. Neptune seems like the best choice, especially in the long run. Even though Flush is the consistent play, Neptune could be a game winner.\n\nNo reason to sell anything, and no reason to skip. To the Moon will be boosting my interest nicely next round. So, the play is clear: I'm selecting Neptune. Hoping for that Straight Flush!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
