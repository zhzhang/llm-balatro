{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Ante 8, Standard Pack Optimization**\n\nOkay, Ante 8, round 21. Time to really maximize this score. Currently, I have $82 and am looking at a Standard Pack. The goal is to maximize my score to beat Ante 8.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty interesting: Zany Joker (Common, but offers +1 slot and is 3 of a kind mult), Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon (+1 slot), Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination (+1 slot). I also have \"The Tower,\" a Stone card enhancement as a consumable. I also have a collection of Vouchers that are: Liquidation, Palette, Clearance Sale, Paint Brush, Magic Trick, and Hieroglyph.\n\nWith Hallucination active, I know the next round may involve a Tarot card. I see my Vampire currently sitting at X3.7 mult. Baseball Card is going to give me a big boost because I'm running five Uncommon Jokers currently.\n\nThe Standard Pack gives me three choices: Ace of Hearts, 5 of Spades, and 3 of Diamonds. The Ace of Hearts intrigues me as it says it gives $3 when played. This would suggest it's a Gold Card or has a Gold Seal. This is perfect for Vampire, and I want to see if it's enhanced. I'm going with the Ace because the money or the potential enhancement for Vampire is too good to pass up.\n\nI'm in the pack selection stage (`STANDARD_PACK`). I've got to either pick a card or skip. I'm choosing the Ace of Hearts at position 1.\n\nAfter the pack, I'll be back in the SHOP. I still want to buy the Marble Joker (Uncommon).\n\nLet's do the math on the Marble Joker. Right now, I have 8 slots from 5 Base and 3 from negative Jokers. If I sell Zany, that's only 7 slots and 7 Jokers. Then buying the Marble Joker would give me back to 8, and increase my mult. Let's see... Baseball Card gives me 1.5x Mult per uncommon Joker. Currently, that's 5 Uncommons (Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire). So, 1.5^5 = 7.59x. Now, if I buy Marble, I will get 6 Uncommons and a boost to 1.5^6 = 11.39x. That is a significant upgrade.\n\nI also have \"The Tower\" (Stone card). I can't use it now, but I could get a nice boost by feeding Vampire an enhanced card. \"The Tower\" needs a target, which I don't have here. I should be able to use that in a later round. I am currently in a booster pack selection screen (`STANDARD_PACK`).\n\nThe Ace of Hearts is +11 chips and $3. Taking the Ace is best.\n\nSo, I'm going to `select 1`.\n\nThe command is correct; I am in a Standard Pack. The prompt says \"select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1>...\". This is a Standard Pack, so no hand cards are needed.\nLet's just take the Ace and keep going.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
