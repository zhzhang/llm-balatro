{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Prioritizing the Vampire**\n\nOkay, so it's ante 6/8, round 15, and I'm in the shop phase. I have $81 to play with and a pretty solid joker lineup: Crafty Joker, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany Joker, Vampire (my main focus), and Seltzer. I'm maxed out on jokers, which is good. My hand levels are decent, Flush is at level 3. I just played a Flush which did well.\n\nMy priority is the Vampire, which provides a x3.2 multiplier when fed. That means I need to keep finding enhancements. Given the options, I think a Standard Pack for $2 is the best move. It's cheap and offers a chance at another enhanced card. \"Ride the Bus\" is useless to me. Magic Trick is low priority right now. I have to be careful with the money.\n\nI'm thinking about To the Moon and Bootstraps. To the Moon is giving me interest. Bootstraps provides a 32x multiplier based on my $81 balance. I should try to not let that go down by too much.\n\nSo, first, I will buy the Standard Pack (`buy_booster 1`). It fits my vampire-focused strategy. After I open the pack, I'll assess whether to reroll the shop for Tarot or Planet cards (for enhancements and flush leveling), or just move on to the next round. I'm choosing the standard pack because it's only $2, and the discount means I'm only losing a small bit of power from Bootstraps.\n\nSo, my action will be `buy_booster` for position 1. That should set me up nicely.\n\nI've calculated:\n*   My current money is $81.\n*   The Standard Pack cost is $2.\n*   The new balance will be $79, with Bootstraps going to +30.\n\nSo, I will now send `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
