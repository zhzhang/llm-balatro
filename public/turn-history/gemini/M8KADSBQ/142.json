{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 14, Ante 5/8, and I've got $74 to work with in the SHOP phase. My Joker situation is pretty interesting: Crafty Joker for Flushes, Four Fingers for Flushes and Straights (a potential pivot point), To the Moon (which is good), Bootstraps (my money multiplier, currently at +28), Zany Joker (for Three of a Kind, which I might use Four Fingers for), and Vampire (the real investment here, currently at 3.1x multiplier, needing enhanced cards to grow). My hand levels are Straight Flush 3 and Flush 3, with others lower.\n\nLooking at the Shop, I see Venus (increasing Three of a Kind level), Flash Card (multiplier on re-rolls, which seems bad to me), and the Jumbo Standard Pack (my primary focus). Vouchers are great, with Liquidation and Clearance Sale keeping everything cheap.\n\nMy core goal here is to maximize my chip generation for the future, especially to reach Ante 8. Vampire needs feeding, and the Jumbo Standard Pack is the best way to do that. The strategy is Flush/Four Fingers for now, but I might pivot into Three of a Kind.\n\nHere's my immediate plan:\n\n1.  **Priority: Buy the Jumbo Standard Pack**. It's the best way to find enhanced cards and feed Vampire.\n2.  **Venus:** Since I have Four Fingers, Three of a Kind is cheap and useful. It's only $1, so I will buy it.\n3.  **Flash Card:** While the +2 Mult per reroll seems nice, it directly conflicts with Bootstraps. Spending money on rerolls negates Bootstraps' multiplier benefit. A net zero gain for $5 spent. I won't buy it unless I switch to a reroll strategy.\n\nI have To the Moon, which gives me good interest on the money I hold. This is good for both Bootstraps and the extra cash.\n\nI will buy the Jumbo Standard Pack ($3). This is the active move to build the deck and feed Vampire. I'll evaluate the pack contents afterward.\n\nI can consider buying Venus first, but since it's a \"buy and use\" card, I'll go with the Jumbo Standard Pack first.\n\nSo, I will take the action, `buy_booster`, on the first position: `1 (Jumbo Standard Pack)`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
