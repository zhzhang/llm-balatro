{"reasoning":"**The Vampire's Banquet: Maximizing Multiplier for the Final Bite**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, Round 22, and I'm in the shop with a TAROT pack. Got $94, which is enough to buy this. My priority is to beef up that Vampire joker for the boss. Currently at X3.9, which will become significantly higher. The goal is to eat as many enhancements as possible. I've got a decent Joker setup: Bootstraps for base mult, To the Moon (negative) for Joker slot, Vampire is the core, Baseball Card to boost my Uncommons, Hallucination for tarot chances (though it didn't trigger this time, apparently), and Marble Joker. The Baseball Card is going to do work here. I've confirmed that I have four uncommon Jokers: Bootstraps, To the Moon, Vampire, and Marble Joker. Counting is important, and 1.5 ^4 = 5.0625x mult.\n\nNow for the pack. I've got options: The Moon, The Magician (Lucky Cards), The World, Death, and The Empress (Mult Cards).  Enhancements are what Vampire eats, so that guides my choice. The Magician and Empress both offer enhancements, so that is the decision to make. Death isn't worth it since I only have 2 enhancements in my hand already and Death would make one new one.  Empress and Magician are each a +2. The Moon and World don't help Vampire, even though Spades are good for a Flush.\n\nMy hand has a mix of Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs. Since I'm eyeing the long game, let's look at the best option for Vampire's diet.  Both are equal in Vampire scaling (0.1 x 2 = 0.2 increase), but The Empress guarantees a +4 Mult on the enhanced card, which will give a little more oomph to the hand before Vampire eats. My goal is to enhance cards that are in suits. Spades are common in my hand, so Empress it is.\n\nThe Empress is the better move, so I'll target cards 1 (Ace of Spades) and 2 (Jack of Spades) in my hand with The Empress from position 5 in the pack. It doesn't matter much whether I pick Magician or Empress, but Empress at least gives me a boost to the hand before the Vampire gets to eat the card.\n\nSo, the action will be `select 5 1 2`.  I'm focusing on Vampire scaling, so Spades don't give any advantage in this case. Also, it might be possible to duplicate an existing enhancement, but it provides less benefit. The Vampire is king.\n\nOne last check: everything is correct with the Jokers. Two negatives, so that is 7 slots. All is well, the plan will be `select 5 1 2` to maximize Vampire's growth.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [5, 1, 2],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5,1,2]"}
