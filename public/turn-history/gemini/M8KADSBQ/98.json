{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Big Blind or Skip?**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 10, Big Blind. I'm sitting on a decent hand and a few key Jokers: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire. Plus, The Sun consumable is ready if needed. The goal is to clear the 7500 chip Big Blind.\n\nI've got the Negative Tag from skipping the Small Blind, which gives me a free and negative Joker next shop. The Big Blind skip reward is the \"Skip Tag\" which gives me $5 per skipped blind - a cool $20 right now. But I'm flush enough with $41 to get both Bootstraps and To The Moon, and Vampire's potential is a priority.\n\nSkipping means I bypass the shop *before* the Boss, and the Negative Tag will trigger in the shop *after* the Boss. I don't want to do this.\n\nIf I play, I trigger the shop *before* the Boss, which is where the Negative Tag applies to the next base Joker I see. This is crucial for getting that negative joker sooner rather than later. Plus, playing gives me the chance for interest on my money.\n\nAlso, playing the round gives me a chance to find enhanced cards for Vampire to scale with.\n\nI just need to clear 7500 chips. My last hand was a level 2 Flush (Base 50 x 6). With my Jokers, even a simple flush easily clears 7500: (50 + ~20) * (6 + 16) * 2.5 = 70 * 22 * 2.5 = 3850. Two flushes would do it. \n\nI'm definitely playing. Skipping gives me cash, but the shop and Negative Joker are more valuable for the long run.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
