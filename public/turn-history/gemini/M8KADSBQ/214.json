{"reasoning":"**The Shop: A Critical Appraisal**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 7, Round 19. $78 in the bank. I've got a strong Flush build going, centered around \"Four Fingers\" for consistency. The real power is in these Uncommon Jokers: \"Bootstraps\" (essential money-to-mult), \"To the Moon\" (more interest, but already capped by my high balance), \"Seltzer\" (retriggers are clutch!), and \"Vampire\" (scaling X-Mult - currently sitting at a juicy X3.5). The \"Baseball Card\" is the glue, amplifying all the Uncommon Jokers (X7.59 currently). And let's not forget \"Zany Joker\" and \"Hallucination,\" both adding slots and helping me fit everything in, though those negative effects will be a nuisance.\n\nThe shop itself? Cloud 9 is sitting there, but it's an Uncommon, and I'm jam-packed with Jokers. Buying it means selling something, and nothing in the shop justifies that. It's a non-starter. The Ace of Hearts? Nah, not worth the dollar when I could be spending on Bootstraps or interest. Rerolling is too expensive at this point. I need to keep that cash flowing.\n\nThe current setup is already hitting hard, easily reaching the Ante 7 thresholds. The \"Cloud 9\" is tempting due to the Baseball Card synergy but I can't spare any slots. There's just no way to make room for it. I am not seeing anything that's going to make my build significantly better.\n\nI did a quick calculation: With Seltzer re-triggers, I'm easily looking at scores north of 200k+ per hand, even more if the Vampire keeps scaling. I'm safe. Rerolling a few times already, I am running a very strong setup for Ante 7. There's no value in buying Cloud 9 or Ace of Hearts.\n\nWait, I should check my slots before I finalize the build!\n\nOkay, so the negative Jokers give me a total of 8 Joker slots, which is perfect because I have 8 Jokers. I cannot swap Cloud 9 without selling one of the core Uncommons.\n\nLet's look at the Joker order: \"Zany\" then \"Bootstraps\" for the additive mult, then the utility Jokers. No need to swap the order of Jokers.\n\nOkay, everything looks optimized. Time to hit \"Round Select.\" Let's maximize that Bootstraps and interest! No need to hold the cards any longer.\n\nI'm ready to move. This deck is optimized for scoring in the next round. Rerolling again would be throwing money away.\n\nFinal Decision: **`round_select`**.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
