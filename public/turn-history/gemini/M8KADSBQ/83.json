{"reasoning":"**Current Strategic Analysis: Standard Pack Purchase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 3, Round 9. I've got $48. My build revolves around flushes thanks to \"Four Fingers,\" and I have key jokers: \"To the Moon\" (interest!), \"Bootstraps\" (Mult!), and \"Vampire\" (needs enhanced cards to scale). I also have the Hieroglyph voucher, which is cool for a future round.\n\nI'm focused on getting more food for Vampire right now. I need to keep money above $45 or $50 to keep \"Bootstraps\" and \"To the Moon\" active. I'm already past the interest cap.\n\nThe shop has \"Madness\" which is a hard no because it'll eat one of my jokers, which would mess up my current plan, \"Sly Joker\" which does not help with a flush build, and \"Director's Cut\" which rerolls boss blinds, which I can consider, but is not urgent right now.\n\nThe \"Standard Pack\" is my best bet because it *might* contain an enhanced card. If I get one, I immediately feed it to \"Vampire.\" It is a cheap, low risk buy. I was in this situation before. I was in a tarot selection before.\n\nMy thinking is: buy the Standard Pack. Even if it's not enhanced, I can still use the new card, or replace a low rank card. My goal is to maximize \"Vampire\" and maintain the existing synergy of \"Four Fingers\" and \"Bootstraps.\"\n\nI've got $48. If I buy the $4 Standard Pack, I drop to $44. That's fine for the short term, because, given \"To the Moon,\" I'll want to get my money back above $45. My other options are not good.\n\nIt's the \"Standard Pack\" or a reroll. Reroll is high risk. The Standard Pack might give me an enhanced card for Vampire, a good diamond card for flushes, or high-rank cards. That's what I am aiming for.\n\nRight, time to buy the Standard Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
