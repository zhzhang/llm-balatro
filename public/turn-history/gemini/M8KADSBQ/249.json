{"reasoning":"**My Assessment: Round 22, Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 22. I'm in the Shop phase. My immediate goal is to maximize my scoring for the upcoming Boss Blind. I'm sitting on a solid foundation with my Vampire and Baseball Card combo. The Vampire (X3.9 Mult) is my key scorer, but it's *scoring* on the enhanced cards provided by my Marble Joker, which adds Stone cards every Blind. My Baseball Card (X1.5 for Uncommons, about 5.06x) is boosting four Uncommons: Bootstraps, To the Moon, Vampire, and Marble Joker.\n\nI've got $94, and my hand is a Flush Level 6 (110/14 Base). I have Liquidation, Palette, Clearance Sale, Paint Brush, Magic Trick, and Hieroglyph Vouchers.\n\nMy shop options are: Neptune (Straight Flush Level), Strength (Rank up 2 cards), and a Celestial Pack ($2). I also have Reroll available for $5. I have Hallucination in play, which gives me a 1 in 2 chance to create a Tarot card when I open any booster.\n\nGiven my setup, here's my line of thought: I need to feed the Vampire and keep that Flush strong.\n\nI'm leaning towards the Celestial Pack. I want to try to trigger Hallucination for a free Tarot card; if it triggers, then cool! If not, I can see what planet I get. Jupiter is the ideal choice as it will help level my Flush. The Strength card might be useful but it isn't an enhancement so the Vampire doesn't feed off of it. Neptune is less immediately useful, but might be worth considering later if I want to switch to a Straight Flush focus. Rerolling is cheap, but I don't really *need* anything specific right now, so I'll prioritize the Celestial Pack.\n\nThe plan:\n\n1.  **Buy the Celestial Pack ($2).** This is a no-brainer with Hallucination in play.\n2.  **Check for Hallucination.** Fingers crossed!\n3.  **Select a planet (Jupiter preferred).**\n4.  **Consider my options after opening the pack - rerolling to find Tarot cards, or just moving on to the next round.**\n\nOkay, now to get this done. Let me get that Celestial Pack... Action: `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
