{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy: Maximize Vampire's Multiplier**\n\nOkay, I'm in the Shop phase of Ante 7, Round 19 with $67, and it's time to strategize. I've got a decent Joker setup going, but the focus is clearly on Vampire. Let's see... I'm looking at my Jokers: Zany, Bootstraps, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Seltzer, Vampire, Baseball Card, and Hallucination.\n\nThe key here is Baseball Card. I need to remember that Baseball Card makes *each* Uncommon Joker give an additional X1.5 multiplier. To the Moon, Seltzer, and Vampire are all Uncommon, so their multipliers will be significantly boosted. Currently, Vampire is at X3.5, and I need to make sure to leverage this.\n\nI just bought a Jumbo Standard Pack and have a 9 of Spades (Mult enhancement) in my hand, so I should be able to feed Vampire with that. I also have a Standard Pack left for sale in the shop.\n\nLooking at the shop, I have a Jack of Diamonds ($1) and a Standard Pack ($2). I can buy the remaining Standard Pack ($2), reroll ($5), or buy Jack of Diamonds ($1).\n\nGiven that I have plenty of money and the 50% chance for a Tarot card (via Hallucination) plus another card for Vampire to munch on, buying the Standard Pack ($2) is the obvious high-value play here. I want that Tarot card to enhance the deck. Plus, it's just cheap.\n\nThe Joker order is good for now: additive multipliers like Zany and Bootstraps, followed by the multiplicative ones like Vampire and the Baseball Card triggered multipliers.\n\nI recommend buying the Standard Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
