{"reasoning":"**Current Pack Analysis and Card Selection**\n\nOkay, so I'm in a `STANDARD_PACK` phase. The objective is clear: pick a card. Let's see what's on offer and how it synergizes with my current inventory. I've got a decent setup: a Crafty Joker for Flushes, Four Fingers for Straights/Flushes, To the Moon which provides a negative, a Bootstraps joker, a Zany Joker, the Vampire, and Seltzer.\n\nVampire is the heart of my engine here. It's all about getting enhanced cards into play to juice its multiplier. Right now, it's at X3.2 and wants that sweet X0.1 per enhanced card, though it removes the enhancement in the process. Seltzer is also interesting - it re-triggers cards, though currently, the best value is to be had through Vampire.\n\nThe pack gives me three options: a Jack of Clubs (base card), a 6 of Diamonds (base), and a 9 of Clubs, which is a *Lucky Card*. Bingo! The 9 of Clubs is enhanced, meaning when played, it will trigger Vampire. The key thing here is how the game mechanics work with the Seltzer trigger. Let's break it down:\n\nIf I choose the 9 of Clubs, the game will play the card. Vampire triggers on the first score of that card, gaining +0.1 multiplier. However, the enhancement gets removed by Vampire on that first trigger. The Seltzer then re-triggers everything - but the 9 of Clubs is *no longer* enhanced, so Vampire doesn't get another boost from it being re-triggered, as Vampire can only get the bonus on the first play of a scoring enhanced card.\n\nEven with that caveat, getting an enhanced card in my deck is still the priority to feed Vampire. The other options are base cards - not a good choice, since I want to get that multiplier going with Vampire.\n\nTherefore, the obvious action is to select the 9 of Clubs, which is in the third position of the pack. I don't need to specify any targets or anything.\n\nSo, I'm going to enter `select 3`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
