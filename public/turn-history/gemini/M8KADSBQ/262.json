{"reasoning":"**Flush It! Time to Nail This Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Crimson Heart boss, random Joker gets knocked out each hand. Target's 100,000, I'm at 65,205, so I need 34,795 more chips. Two hands left, two discards. Let's see... currently holding a 10 of Spades, 4 of Hearts, a Gold Jack of Diamonds, an 8 of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds, two 2 of Diamonds, and a Stone Card. The Jokers are Bootstraps (mult), To the Moon (negative), Vampire (current X3.9), Baseball Card (multiplies Uncommons), Hallucination (currently disabled), Marble Joker (+chips), and Ice Cream (+chips).\n\nHallucination's already disabled. A flush gets 140 base chips, 18 mult, add the Stone card for an additional 50 and the others for ~145 chips. Bootstraps add 24 mult, and Baseball Card multiplies for each Uncommon - and I've got Bootstraps, To the Moon, Vampire, and Marble Joker. The Baseball Card multiplier is X1.5 for each. The real kicker is the Vampire! Even if I get a different disabled Joker, I'm pretty set.\n\nRight now, I have six Diamonds, five are needed for a Flush. The Stone card's nice, but it's not a Diamond, so it doesn't count toward a Flush. This isn't that hard. The Jack of Diamonds is a Gold Card, which is great but the bonus is only $3. I need to keep the $3.\n\nA Flush of those five Diamonds... that's 306 chips, additive mults add up to 42, and the multiplicative mults are looking at 3.9 (Vampire) * (1.5^4) (Baseball Card for all those Uncommons). The base Flush mult is 18 + Bootstraps' 24 is 42. And the Baseball multiplier (4 Uncommons) is 5.0625. Overall, that's roughly a 250,000 chip score.\n\nOkay, let's play the cards. I'll play 4 (8D), 5 (6D), 6 (3D), 7 (2D), and 8 (2D). Keeping the Jack of Diamonds for the $3 and the Stone Card doesn't help my hand.\nIt doesn't matter if I lose Hallucination: It is a common Joker, and doesn't affect the hand score, at least not that much.\n\nSo, let's put it all together:\n*   I can play 5 Diamond cards, making a Flush, at Level 8.\n*   The cards are 8D, 6D, 3D, 2D, and 2D.\n*   140 (Flush) + 21 = 161 base chips\n*   50 (Marble Joker) + 95 (Ice Cream) = 145 chip bonus\n*   Total Chips: 306\n*   Level 8 Flush has 18 Mult.\n*   Add 24 for Bootstraps = 42\n*   Multipliers = 3.9 (Vampire) * 5.0625 (Baseball card X1.5^4)= ~20\n*   Total Mult: 42 * 3.9 * 5.0625 = 829.2\n*   Score: 306 * 829 = 253,674\n\nEven with a worst case, that's enough to win this hand. If it disables Vampire, I still win. If it disables Baseball card, I still win. If it disables Bootstraps, I still win.\n\nAll I need to do is keep the Gold Card Jack of Diamonds in my hand for the end of round $3 bonus.\n\nAnd, if it helps, the Stone card can be added to the hand, and will add chips, but not add to the Flush bonus.\n\nPlay: Cards 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Flush)\nChip Score: ~250,000\nThat's it, easy win.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
