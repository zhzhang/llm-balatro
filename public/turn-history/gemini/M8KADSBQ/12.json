{"reasoning":"**Round 1 Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at the start of Round 1, facing \"The Heart\" boss, which means heart cards are debuffed. My objective is to reach 600 chips. I have a single joker, Four Fingers, which lets me make Flushes and Straights with four cards – that's potentially useful. I have a meager $2, and no consumables or vouchers to help me right now. Flush and Straight are both level 1, so the multipliers are 35x4 and 30x4, respectively.\n\nSince I have no other options, I must start the round by playing a hand. I'll initiate the `play_round` action. I don't need to specify any card positions, or a hand type, or to estimate chips for this command, but the schema allows them to be null, so I'll set those to null. It seems a previous action included the command `round_select`, however, that was to *select* the round and is not an available action. Here's the JSON I'll use:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
