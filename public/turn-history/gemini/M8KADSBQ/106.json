{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Celestial Pack Choice**\n\nOkay, current phase: `PLANET_PACK`. I've got $50, ante 4, round 11. My Jokers are pretty good: `Four Fingers` for easy Straight Flushes, `To the Moon` for interest, `Bootstraps` for multiplying per $5, `Vampire` to scale with enhanced cards, and `Zany Joker` as a negative for 3 of a kind which I won't play. I have `The Sun` consumable and `Clearance Sale`, `Hieroglyph` vouchers. My hand stats are focused on Flush (Level 2, 17 plays) and Straight Flush (Level 1, 2 plays).\n\nNow, the pack options: Mercury (Pair), Neptune (Straight Flush), and Uranus (Two Pair).\n\nMy core strategy is Flushes, and scaling `Vampire` with enhanced cards. However, `Four Fingers` makes Straight Flushes almost as easy to hit as Flushes and Straights because I only need 4 cards. `Neptune` will level up Straight Flushes, giving me +4 Mult and +40 chips.\n\nI need to decide, with `Four Fingers` now in play, a Straight Flush is just as easy as a Flush or Straight (4 cards). A Level 1 Straight Flush already has better base stats than a Level 2 Flush (100 chips/8 Mult vs 50 chips/6 Mult). Upgrading the Straight Flush with `Neptune` to 140 chips and 12 Mult would be a significant jump and directly synergizes with `Four Fingers`.\n\nI need to select `Neptune`. The card is in position 2. I have double-checked the JSON requirements, and I've verified that Planets don't need targets. Checking the other options, Mercury (Pair) and Uranus (Two Pair) would level up hands I rarely play. **Neptune is the best option** given my Joker setup and the need to scale.\n\n*   Mercury (1): No.\n*   Neptune (2): Yes.\n*   Uranus (3): No.\n\nOkay, action is \"select\", positions \\[2], intended\\_hand\\_type is null (planet card), estimated\\_chips is null. I've double-checked all the parsing requirements and formatting: no extra text, all strings double-quoted, positions 1-indexed. The JSON structure is correct.\n\nI need to consider if there's any reason NOT to select Neptune, but given the current state of the game, Neptune is the most logical choice to increase the scoring potential of my hand.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
