{"reasoning":"**The Seltzer Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 6, round 15. Got $87 in the bank. Flushes are my main game, with Crafty Joker and Four Fingers leading the charge. Bootstraps is giving me a solid +34 Mult already, and Vampire's primed to get juicy with any enhancements I can find. Zany’s there for some bonus 3OAK action too. And of course, To the Moon's incentivizing me to keep that cash flow healthy.\n\nRight now, the shop has Seltzer! It's only $3! And it retriggers every card played for 10 hands! That's HUGE. That's practically a straight-up doubling of my flush scoring potential, especially with Vampire. This is a no-brainer. I have a voucher that might affect the cost of the Seltzer card but it doesn't. \n\nI'm thinking, \"Should I just go for Standard or Jumbo Standard booster packs immediately after, for a chance at enhancements? Or just skip the packs entirely, given that I'm flush focused\".\n\nIt's a Joker, and it's a steal. I am going to buy it. $87 - $3 is no issue, given To the Moon and Bootstraps. Then, I'll see what the booster packs offer. I'd *love* to see a Tarot pack for enhancements, but Standard will have to do if it's there.\n\nThe action is simple: `buy_card 1`. I need to ensure that the command works as expected. The schema seems to be `buy_card <position>`.\n\nJust to confirm: Seltzer will occupy a Joker slot. Currently, my Joker slots are: Crafty, Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, Zany, Vampire. The order is good. Seltzer fits *after* these, and will boost the card scores *before* any of the Jokers trigger, so it's a fantastic fit.\n\nFinal decision: I'm buying Seltzer first. Next action: `buy_card 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
