{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Maximizing Vampire**\n\nOkay, here we are in round 4 with a $13 bankroll. The big blind just completed, so it’s shop time. Currently, my economy is alright, bringing in $4 interest, thanks to \"To the Moon\". My four jokers are solid: \"Four Fingers\" is great for flush/straight potential, \"To the Moon\" fuels my interest, \"Bootstraps\" gives me a solid mult boost, and most importantly, \"Vampire\" which will scale my X-mult.\n\nThe shop is showing a few options, but my immediate focus is on feeding the Vampire. \"Neptune\" for Straight Flush is decent, but I've only played one so far. \"Green Joker\" could provide some scaling with hands played, but it's not the primary scaler.\n\n\"Tarot Merchant\" looks tempting, especially with Vampire in play. More Tarot cards translate to more enhancements, and thus, more X-mult for my Vampire. However, buying the Tarot Merchant would leave me with only $3, which really cripples \"Bootstraps\" and \"To the Moon\".\n\nThe \"Arcana Pack\" is where I think my money needs to be. It has a chance of offering Tarot cards, which can be used to enhance my cards and, in turn, fed to \"Vampire\". The \"Celestial Pack\" has its uses. If I get Jupiter (Flush) or maybe Saturn (Straight) or Mars (4-of-a-Kind), it may also be useful.\n\nConsidering the economy is key, maximizing interest is crucial. I need to balance spending with retaining interest. Spending too much can really hurt my interest and Mult. With that said, I am going to buy the \"Arcana Pack\" for $4. I'll be left with $9, which brings in $2 base interest, plus $2 from \"To the Moon\", for a total of $4 interest, as well as +2 from \"Bootstraps\". I need to prioritize finding good Tarot cards.\n\nAs for the \"Green Joker\", it costs $4. If I had to buy it, I would have $5, which gives me $1 interest, and +2 from Bootstraps. Compared to spending only on the Arcana Pack, I think it is less impactful.\n\nUltimately, getting the \"Arcana Pack\" is the best immediate step. Now, let's execute: `buy_booster 2`. Let's feed the Vampire!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
