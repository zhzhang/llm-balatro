{"reasoning":"**My analysis of this shop phase is now complete, and the next logical step is clear.**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 4, Round 10. $41 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Four Fingers, To the Moon, Bootstraps, and Vampire. My primary goal is scaling Vampire, which is currently at x2.5 Multiplier. I'm leveraging Bootstraps for additional Mult (currently +16) and \"To the Moon\" for consistent interest generation. The \"Gluttonous Joker\" is a weak option. The Sun consumable is ready to go.\n\nThe interest calculation is straightforward. At $41, I'm already maximizing my base interest ($5) and getting an additional $8 from \"To the Moon,\" totaling $13 in interest per round. Rerolling the shop ($5) would drop me to $36 and reduce interest by only $1. The main priority right now is to keep stacking money with \"To the Moon\" as the shop has nothing of value. The shop is a waste of time. I want to build towards Ante 8, so I need to get enhanced cards to boost the Vampire.\n\nI need Tarot or Spectral packs for Vampire enhancements. Given the current shop and my strong economy, the optimal move is to proceed to the round selection.\n\nI've already bought the consumable and checked the shop contents. With the shop empty except for that one bad Joker, and with my power level already decent (enough to easily clear Ante 4), it's far better to select the next round. I'm focusing on preserving my high interest income and building toward a stronger position.\n\nIt is better for the economy to do the round. Plus, the next hand offers more chances for Vampire to trigger enhanced cards. The \"Gluttonous Joker\" is not worth the $4. The best strategy is to move on.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable action is `round_select`. Let's check a few things before providing the response, however.\n\nI have already double checked the \"To the Moon\" and \"Bootstraps\" calculation. Everything checks out.\n\nI am not in a position to use \"The Sun\". I must save it for when I have cards in hand.\n\nI've checked that the available action does not take arguments.\n\nAnd I have now confirmed, that, yes, I should provide JSON.\n\nFinal decision: `round_select`.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
