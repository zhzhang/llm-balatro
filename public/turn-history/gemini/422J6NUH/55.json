{"reasoning":"**My Calculated Move for Round 7**\n\nOkay, here we go. The Big Blind is on, and I'm staring down the barrel with zero chips against a 3000 target with only four hands left. Let's see...I've got the Gros Michel for a +15 Mult and a chance to destroy itself, the Egg for a small payout later, the Droll Joker with +10 Mult on Flushes (and the Polychrome edition for x1.5), Perkeo (legendary!) and Delayed Gratification. The consumables include a Negative Moon, which is key to my thinking.\n\nMy hand? Well, it's begging for a Flush of Clubs: 9, 8, and 2, plus the Ace and 10 of Clubs. This could get interesting. I need a *Flush* for this turn.\n\nLet's do the math. The Flush gets me 80 base chips and a 10 base multiplier. The Ace is worth 41 chips with the bonus, and the others are the rank value, totaling 70 chips from the cards. That gets me 150 chips total. Multiplier-wise, I get +15 from Gros Michel, +10 from Droll (because it *is* a Flush), and the x1.5 Polychrome from Droll. It gets me a 52.5 mult, and a final score of 7875, way over the target of 3000. Perfect.\n\nNow, strategy. I'm *not* using the Moon consumable because I want Perkeo to duplicate it after the shop. I'm not discarding anything so Delayed Gratification can give me extra money at the end of the round. I simply *must* play this flush.\n\nThe current Joker order is Gros Michel, then the Egg, then Droll, then Perkeo, then Delayed Gratification. I think that's optimal because Michel's add is *before* Droll's multipliers.\n\nI'm playing the 9 of Clubs (position 1), 8 of Clubs (position 2), 2 of Clubs (position 3), Ace of Clubs (position 6), and 10 of Clubs (position 7).\n\nI really do not have a reason to rearrange. There is no reason to use the Negative Moon. I'm not discarding.\n\n**FINAL CHECK:** The `play` command will use positions `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7]` and the `intended_hand_type` is indeed \"flush\" and the `estimated_chips` is 7875. I've double checked the math and the positions. Perkeo triggers at the end of the shop. I am good.\n\nOkay, let's verify that the cards are right. Yes, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 are the Clubs. My bonus is working. Let's run it again: Base 80, cards 70. 150 total chips. 10 (base), +15 (Michel), +10 (Droll) is 35, x1.5 is 52.5. 150 * 52.5 = 7875. The math checks out. I'm double-checking the system prompt now to make sure it's not going to screw me.\n\nWait a second. I am checking the Joker order *again*. If Michel is before Droll, it's (Base + 15 + 10) * 1.5. If Droll was before Michel, it's (Base + 10) * 1.5 + 15. The first result is 52.5. This is better.\n\nI'm ready to move. Final check: `play` positions `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7]` and `intended_hand_type` as \"flush\", and the final `estimated_chips` is 7875.\n\nI already converted the Hearts to Clubs. The use_consumable command has already executed.\n\nChecking positions again: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7. Yes. Double check: 9c, 8c, 2c, Ac, 10c. Perfect.\n\nAgain: the estimated total is (80+70)*((10+15+10)*1.5) = 150 * 52.5 = 7875.\n\nNo, Droll's edition triggers *with* its +10 Mult, so Michel comes first.\n\nI am playing all five cards. The goal is 3000.\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,6,7]"}
