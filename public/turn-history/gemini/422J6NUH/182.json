{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis and Action for Ante 6**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6, $105, and a hand built around Flushes. My goal is to maximize score, and the key is Perkeo and Jupiter. The ideal scenario is to leverage Perkeo to duplicate Jupiter at the end of the shop. I need to keep the original Jupiter, and use the copies Perkeo provides.\n\n*   **Initial Assessment:** I've got a solid foundation with existing Jokers (Gros Michel, Droll, Blue, Ramen). The inventory is good. Gros Michel provides +15 Mult but has a chance to break. Droll is a good source of Mult, and Ramen is x2 Mult which is great for scaling. I have the \"Reroll Surplus\" voucher which is a critical piece of information.\n*   **The Choice:** The shop offers Flash Card (+2 Mult per reroll), Trading Card, and Odd Todd. Trading Card is good for economy, but I'm flush with cash (pun intended), so I don't need that. Odd Todd offers chip bonuses for odd-ranked cards, but I'm playing Flushes and it's too restrictive compared to Blue Joker's +94 chips. Flash Card, on the other hand, is the real game-changer here. With the Reroll Surplus voucher, its scaling potential is enormous. I must act fast. I am currently spending $5 on rerolls this turn to build up Mult.\n*   **The Gamble:** I initially hesitated on Flash Card, considering Gros Michel's +15 Mult. However, that joker might break. Now, I realize that with the \"Reroll Surplus\" voucher, Flash Card's permanent scaling is far superior. I can get it to +16 or more with the current cash in this shop. The cost is $92. It is a no brainer.\n*   **The Decision:** Sell Gros Michel, and buy Flash Card. Then start rerolling as much as possible to scale. I have to do this at the start of the turn so I can leverage the Flash Card Mult gains.\n*   **Perkeo's Role:** Perkeo's function is the most important element of the whole plan. The goal is to maximize the number of Jupiters at the end of the shop. I need the original Jupiter to survive so Perkeo makes copies.\n*   **The Action:** The action is to sell the first Joker (Gros Michel) and buy the Flash Card. That should get things moving.\n*   **Reasoning:** Flash Card is a permanent upgrade, and with the discount voucher, rerolling becomes extremely efficient. This move will significantly increase the Mult for future hands, letting me find better cards in the shop too.\n*   **Final Thoughts:** The final action is to sell Gros Michel, then buy Flash Card. This sets up a perfect shop round. Now I can build on this by getting Jupiter copies, and scaling Flash Card. This sets up a good run, and is likely a winning strategy.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
