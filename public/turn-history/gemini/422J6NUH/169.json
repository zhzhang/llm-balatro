{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Perkeo, Ramen, and the Celestial Alignment**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. We're at Ante 6, aiming to crush the next boss blind. Current cash: $77. Here's the situation:\n\nFirst, let's address the Jokers. My core team is Gros Michel (+15 Mult, with a tiny destroy chance - risky, but impactful), Egg (good for money, but useless for scoring), Droll Joker (essential - Polychrome, +10 Mult on Flush, x1.5 Mult - very valuable), Perkeo (Legendary - the key, clones consumables negatively), and Blue Joker (chips: +94).\n\nConsumables: \"The Moon\" (Negative - transforms cards, which is bad with the deck being mostly clubs anyway and not currently useful), and \"Jupiter\" (absolutely vital - levels up Flushes and gives chips). I have a Flush Level 4 (80/10).\n\nShop: Ramen (X2 Mult, solid boost), Rocket (chips, money scaling - Blue Joker and Egg make this less attractive), and 8 Ball (Tarot generation - good, but not the priority). Also have some boosters - Jumbo Celestial Pack and Celestial Pack.\n\nThe critical play here revolves around Perkeo. It clones a random consumable at the end of the shop. I *absolutely* need it to copy Jupiter, not the garbage \"The Moon\". To ensure this, I *must* remove \"The Moon\" from the equation.\n\nThe first step: Get rid of \"The Moon\". That's the priority. However, I have $77, I need Ramen. If I sell \"The Moon,\" Perkeo *must* copy \"Jupiter.\" So I'm selling \"The Moon\" and will likely need to sell \"Egg\" to buy \"Ramen.\" That leaves $120 to spend on boosters.\n\nLet's break down the implications. If I use Ramen, I'm replacing Gros Michel with Ramen: 60 mult. If I replace Egg, 105 mult. Huge.\n\nI have to sell \"The Moon\" to ensure Perkeo clones the correct consumable. I could consider the packs after that.\n\nSo, here's the immediate action: `sell_consumable` at position 1 (that's \"The Moon\"). That guarantees Perkeo gives me another \"Jupiter\" at the end of the shop. After that, I buy \"Ramen.\" Then, I look at the boosters. That's the play!\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
