{"reasoning":"**My Current Game State & Next Steps**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 7, Round 16. I've got $91, and my primary strategy is a Flush build. I'm focusing on that, with several key Jokers: Droll for base Multi, Ramen (though I need to be careful with its discard penalty), The Tribe for Flush Multi, Perkeo who copies consumables (crucial here), and Stuntman for chips. I'm holding one Jupiter consumable, which is *critical* for leveling up my Flushes.\n\nI'm aiming to beat the Ante 7 boss and push on to Ante 8. The Perkeo/Jupiter synergy is my linchpin: I need to end the shop with ONLY Jupiter so that it's the only thing Perkeo copies.\n\nI need to analyze this shop.\n\nRight now, my biggest concerns are:\n\n*   **The Devil:** Tempting, to enhance a card to Gold, but a potential risk with Perkeo, who might copy the *Devil* instead of Jupiter. Hard pass.\n*   **Golden Ticket:** Joker slots are full, so replacing a Joker with a Golden Ticket is a downgrade. Pass.\n*   **Arcana Pack:** This could offer a great card to improve my deck, or a useful consumable (that I can use immediately), but I need to be cautious about getting an extra consumable. If I *do* find another Jupiter, I can use it immediately. Otherwise, I might need to skip it.\n*   **Wasteful Voucher:** +1 Discard is always helpful, especially with Ramen, and it's quite cheap. I *need* this.\n\nSince Perkeo's ability triggers \"at the end of the shop,\" I need to carefully manage my consumables. The key is to keep only Jupiter until I'm ready to move on.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n*   I'll buy the Wasteful voucher ($7). It's a permanent upgrade, and it's a solid investment. I was going to look at the Arcana Pack first, but I need to be sure about the voucher.\n*   *Actually, I'll open the Arcana Pack first, to check what I can use right now and won't be copied. This is good to do before making the voucher purchase.*\n*   Then, I'll move on to end the shop.\n\nOkay, let me double check the numbers. Money: $91. Wasteful Voucher: $7. Arcana Pack: $3.\n\n**Action: `buy_voucher 1`.**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
