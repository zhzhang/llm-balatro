{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Endgame: Chariot for the Win**\n\nOkay, final ante, round 21, the big boss battle is here. I'm sitting on a solid Flush build, already capable of some impressive scores, easily in the 180k-210k range. My current money is $8, and the shop has a crucial item: The Chariot Tarot card for $2. It upgrades a card to Steel, which means a x1.5 multiplier for that hand, an enormous boost. I have Stuntman, but still have room in my hand to play a Steel card. This is a no-brainer.\n\nThe Chariot is the direct upgrade I need. I'm running with Tribe, Droll, Ramen, Stuntman, and Brainstorm. The Tribe, Droll and Brainstorm give the Flush a massive multiplier. Buying The Chariot is crucial. \n\nMy immediate instinct is to just go for it, but I need to think this through. I need to buy it first, using the command `buy_card 2`. I considered using `buy_and_use_consumable`, but that won't work since the Chariot requires a card from my hand, and I don't have those cards right now. I have to buy it first, and use it during the round. \n\nI've got $8 now, after buying the Chariot I'll have $6. I could also buy Strength, but it doesn't make sense with my Flush build. I could also reroll the shop for $5, but that doesn't feel optimal.\n\nWait, I have Judgement as a consumable. I can't use it right now, and I have a full set of good Jokers. Might as well sell Judgement for an extra dollar. That would be an extra dollar, and wouldn't be as good as buying the Chariot.\n\nI am getting x12 from all Jokers. The Chariot is worth a massive 50% increase to my final score.\n\nTherefore, the best action to take is `buy_card 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
