{"reasoning":"**My Celestial Pack Selection**\n\nAlright, let's analyze this Celestial Pack. The user wants me to choose a card, and the options are Uranus (Two Pair), Neptune (Straight Flush), and Saturn (Straight). Looking at my current hand levels and usage, Flush is at Level 4 and I've played it 15 times. Straight Flush is Level 2 and has not been played. Straight is also at Level 4 and played once. Two Pair is at Level 1 and has also never been played.\n\nGiven my Joker setup – Droll Joker boosting Flushes and Perkeo copying \"The Moon\" – I'm clearly focused on Flushes. \"The Moon\" effectively lets me build a single-suit deck by converting cards to Clubs. With that in mind, I need to evaluate these choices.\n\nUranus (Two Pair) is out; I *never* play that. Saturn (Straight) is decent because it already has a good level, and it *is* levelable, but I have only played it once. But it is not my focus.\n\nNeptune (Straight Flush) is the most intriguing. The +4 Mult and +40 chips are great, but the Straight Flush is hard to get, and I haven't even played it. But, with Perkeo and \"The Moon\", I'm rapidly moving towards a predominantly Clubs deck. This conversion makes Straight Flushes not only *possible* but a very viable long-term strategy and a possible game ender!\n\nMy \"Last Played Hands\" confirm the plan: it is all Flushes except for one High Card, so I should focus on that to take advantage of the Droll Joker. \n\nSince I'm not seeing Jupiter (Flush), Neptune is the best choice. While it's a Straight Flush, it *contains* a Flush. My Droll Joker will still trigger! If I happen to get a Straight Flush, it's a huge power spike. Uranus and Saturn don't really synergize with my \"The Moon\" strategy as much.\n\nThere's no reason to skip; any level up is better than none. Neptune's higher scaling (+4 Mult, +40 chips vs. +3 Mult, +30 chips for Saturn) solidifies its position as the best choice.\n\nSo, I'm selecting Neptune. The action will be to select the card at position 2.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
