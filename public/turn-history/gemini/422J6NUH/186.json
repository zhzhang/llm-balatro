{"reasoning":"**Critical Joker Evaluation - The Tribe is a Must-Buy!**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 6, Round 15, sitting on $86. I've got a solid Flush-based deck going, and I just spotted The Tribe in the shop, which is a *massive* X2 multiplier for Flushes! This is a game-changer. I need to make sure I get it.\n\nMy current Joker lineup is: Droll Joker (a solid +10 Mult and 1.5x), Perkeo (for utility, creating negative consumables, which will be essential later), Blue Joker (providing chips, a very strong value), Ramen (x2 multiplier), and a Flash Card (+4 Mult per reroll, scaling but slow).\n\nI have a maxed-out Joker capacity, so one has to go to make room for The Tribe. The question is, which one?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Flash Card:** It's the weakest. Only +4 Mult right now. Scaling is okay, but I need immediate power here, and will take multiple rerolls to be as good as the 2x on the Tribe.\n*   **Blue Joker:** I am not sure about selling this, this is a strong chip gain. However, I can generate chips from other sources (planets). A 2x multiplier is significantly better.\n*   **Droll Joker:** It's solid, giving a +10 mult and 1.5x Multi, but The Tribe provides a flat x2 on flush. I think, its the right move.\n*   **Ramen:** This is a multiplier, as well, but the Tribe is a stronger buy.\n\nI need the Tribe, now!\n\nIf I calculate the math:\n\n*   Current Multiplier: (Base 10 + Droll 10 + Flash 4) * 1.5 * 2 = 72 Mult\n*   If I sell Flash Card for The Tribe: (Base 10 + Droll 10) \\* 1.5 \\* 2 \\* 2 = 120 Mult\n\nThe Tribe gives an immediate power spike!\n\nThe plan is simple. It's an instant and huge upgrade.\n\n*   `sell_joker 5` (Flash Card)\n*   `buy_card 2` (The Tribe).\n\nI should not use Jupiter, because I can't generate a negative Jupiter.\n\nAnd I need to sell Flash Card first.\n\nSo, I will sell Flash Card. Now. Then, I will buy the Tribe. This is the optimal move.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
