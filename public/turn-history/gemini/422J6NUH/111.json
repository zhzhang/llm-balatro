{"reasoning":"**Flush Strategy Optimization - SHOP Phase**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the SHOP phase, Ante 5, Round 11. I've got $72 and a decent joker setup leaning heavily towards a flush strategy: Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker (Polychrome, great for flush), and Perkeo. Plus, Blue Joker for some chip boost. My consumables are \"The Moon\" and Saturn.\n\nMy immediate goal is to guarantee a copy of \"The Moon\" with Perkeo. Right now, to secure that \"The Moon\" copy I *must* clear out Saturn. Perkeo’s a wildcard – it randomly selects a consumable, so only having \"The Moon\" ensures I get the conversion I need to focus on clubs.\n\nI’m currently running a flush, and while Saturn levels up Straight, that won’t hurt me as a bonus. It’s also important to note that I just used Venus.\n\nAfter Saturn is gone, it's just \"The Moon\", so I'll be in a good spot to re-roll and see what the shop has to offer. The shop cards are pretty underwhelming right now: Devious Joker is useless for my strategy and Juggler is useless because I'm out of joker room.\n\nGiven this, I’m issuing the command: `use_consumable 2`. This should be as easy as sending the JSON: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
