{"reasoning":"**Ante 7 Shop Strategy: Flush Focus**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 16 and I'm targeting the next blind, likely needing around 40k-60k chips based on the current Ante. My current strategy is heavily focused on Flushes. I've got a decent Joker setup: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, and Stuntman. My most important consumable is Jupiter, which is currently in the consumable slot. I'm sitting on $81, with some useful vouchers like Clearance Sale and Wasteful.\n\nMy plan here is to *maximize* Perkeo, since I want to duplicate Jupiter every time. Given that, I *definitely* don't want to buy \"The Devil\" because Perkeo might copy it instead of my Jupiter. And \"Golden Ticket\" is out since I'm maxed on Jokers and my current ones are much better for scaling and scoring. So, my focus should be on finding either another Jupiter to hold, or useful Jokers/Vouchers.\n\nI need to keep Jupiter as the *only* consumable when I leave the shop to guarantee Perkeo copies it. With Wasteful in my back pocket, I'm thinking a reroll to see if I can find something better is the best move here, especially since rerolls are cheap ($3). Maybe I can find another Jupiter, a helpful tarot or a better Joker, but my current Jokers are highly synergistic with a Flush build.\n\nSo, first action: `reroll_shop`.\n\nBefore I actually reroll, I'm second-guessing my Joker order, as it can affect how each effect is applied in my current scoring sequence. After thinking it through, the order of scoring should be:\n1.  Stuntman: Adds +250 Chips\n2.  Droll: +10 Mult\n3.  Droll: X1.5 (Polychrome)\n4.  Ramen: X2\n5.  Tribe: X2\n\nAccording to the instructions, independent Jokers activate left-to-right (basic Joker, editions on Jokers).\nSo, in summary: (Base Mult + 10) \\* 1.5 \\* 2 \\* 2, which seems optimal.\n\nI'm ready, let's roll: `reroll_shop`.\n\nAnd before I roll, wait! Should I use Jupiter now? No, if I use it now, there are 0 consumables to copy. Perkeo does nothing. I *must* hold Jupiter.\n\nOkay, now for sure: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
