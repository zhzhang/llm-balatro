{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Play: A Flush for the Win**\n\nOkay, ante 4, round 9. Small Blind is at 5,000, and I've got $26. Four hands left, four discards. Time to assess this hand.\n\nLooking at my inventory, I have some solid Jokers: Gros Michel (+15 mult), Egg ($22 sell, +$3/round), Droll Joker (+10 mult if Flush, x1.5 Mult Polychrome), Perkeo (Legendary, negative copy of consumable), and Crafty Joker (+80 chips if Flush). My hand currently has a 9 Spades (bonus +30 chips), 8 Spades, 3 Spades, 5 Hearts, 8 Clubs, 6 Clubs, 9 Diamonds, and 8 Diamonds. Clubs are most frequent in the deck. The plan is to build a Flush (Level 4, 80 chips/10 mult).\n\nThe core of this strategy revolves around my three \"The Moon\" consumables. They convert up to three cards to Clubs. I'm aiming for a Club Flush. Converting the 9, 8, and 3 Spades to Clubs gets me there. It's a quick way to generate a big score, and it'll easily beat the target.\n\nI need 5 of the same suit. I'm going to convert 9 Spades, 8 Spades, and 3 Spades to Clubs using one \"The Moon\". This gives me a hand of 9 Clubs (bonus), 8 Clubs, 3 Clubs, 8 Clubs, and 6 Clubs, which is a Flush.\n\nMy hand calculation looks like this:\n\n*   Base Flush: 80 chips, 10 mult.\n*   Card Chips: 9 (Bonus +30) + 8 + 3 + 8 + 6 = 64 chips.\n*   Total Chips: 80 (base) + 64 (cards) + 80 (Crafty Joker) = 224 chips.\n*   Mult: 10 (base) + 15 (Gros Michel) + 10 (Droll) = 35 mult.\n*   Polychrome/XMult: 35 * 1.5 = 52.5 mult.\n*   Total Estimate: 224 * 52.5 = 11,760 chips.\n\nTarget is 5,000. Easy win. This hand should crush. Since Perkeo generates a negative consumable, I may as well use one.\n\nI'm using the first \"The Moon\" (position 1) to convert cards 1 (9 Spades), 2 (8 Spades), and 3 (3 Spades). The final hand is 9 Clubs, 8 Clubs, 3 Clubs, 8 Clubs, and 6 Clubs.\n\nUsing Perkeo means I can't be stingy with my \"The Moon\" cards, since I will get a free copy at the end of the round.\n\nI've confirmed my action: `use_consumable 1 1 2 3`.\n\nI need to confirm the consumable selection.\nConsumable positions: 1, 2, 3.\nHand positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nTargeting hand cards 1, 2, 3 with consumable 1. Correct.\n\nJoker order is fine.\n\nJSON output:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 1, 2, 3], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,1,2,3]"}
