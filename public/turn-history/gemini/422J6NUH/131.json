{"reasoning":"**A Deep Dive into Shop Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 5, Big Blind is looming in Round 12. I've got $36. Jokers are: Gros Michel (good mult, but risky), Egg (great for money, but not immediate score), Droll Joker (Flush boost, polychrome multiplier), Perkeo (legendary, consumable copier), and Blue Joker (chips). I'm maxed out at 5 Jokers and have \"The Moon\" as my consumable (which Perkeo will copy). Shop options are: Golden Joker (meh), Baseball Card (multiplies Uncommon Jokers, but I don't have any!), and Red Card (multiplies by skipping boosters – not my plan).\n\nThe Baseball Card is tempting, but it's worthless without Uncommon Jokers, and I've got none.  My current Flush score estimate is ~11,235 chips, and the Big Blind Ante is probably 14,000. Two flushes should clear it.\n\nI'm thinking: I have Perkeo to copy \"The Moon\". I should *not* use or sell it before I leave the shop.\n\nI've got a $4 reroll surplus voucher.  I'm looking for Jupiter (Flush planet), Uncommon Jokers for the Baseball Card, better chip or mult Jokers, or Tarot/Planet packs.\n\nShould I pivot to the Baseball Card strategy?  I could sell Egg for $34, giving me $70.  But then I'm down a Joker.  I'm leaning towards not pivoting.\n\nGiven my current hand, a reroll is a better spend than any of the shop cards. I'm going to reroll.\n\nReroll… and again? Yes, I have enough spare money, and I'm not seeing immediate value from the shop.  The shop is pretty mediocre. But, let's look one last time! The Baseball Card is Rare... I'll need Uncommons to make it work! I'd need to replace Michel, Droll, or Blue with uncommon cards. I'm going to reroll again.\n\nI'm starting to think about *actually* playing the round! I'm pretty satisfied with deck-thinning/suit-fixing with Perkeo/The Moon. But I have money to spare. Let's try one more reroll.\n\nDoes Baseball Card count itself? No! Okay, let's check Droll/Blue Joker - descriptions say Common.\n\nI have $36. I will reroll_shop.\n\nMy hand is strong enough for the Big Blind. I will select the round. But let's check one last time. Should I sell Egg? No, since it gives $3/round.\n\nShould I buy the Baseball Card? No. No immediate synergy.\n\nI need to look again. Big Blind could be higher than my estimate! If 20k, I might need two flushes. I'll reroll one more time to find Jupiter or a better Joker.\n\nLet me double check the Moon! Negative The Moon is great.\n\nOkay, let's reroll.\n\nWait! I need to provide JSON! Got it. `reroll_shop`.\n\n*Wait!* I see booster packs (none). Let's just move to the round to conserve money and let Perkeo work.\n\nIs Baseball worth selling Egg? No, since it has no immediate benefit.\n\nThe user wants me to make a decision, but since I have money to spend, rerolling is the tactical choice.\n\n`reroll_shop`.\n\nI have enough money ($36), and since I'm prepared for the blind, I will select `round_select`.\n\nActually, `reroll_shop` is the smarter tactical play.\n\nOne last look. Baseball card is x1 mult right now. I'd have to replace almost my entire lineup.\n\nOkay, definitely skip Baseball Card.\n\n`reroll_shop`! (Almost typed `round_select` there!)\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
