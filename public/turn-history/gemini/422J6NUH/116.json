{"reasoning":"**My Game Plan: Perkeo Optimization and Run Advancement**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm in the shop (Ante 5, Round 11), with $55 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and Blue Joker. The Moon consumable is the key here. Perkeo will duplicate \"The Moon\", so I want that to be my *only* consumable. This is a powerful Club-heavy strategy.\n\nI've got a few options in the shop: a Joker (+4 Mult, meh), Judgement (creates a random Joker, risky), and Banner (+30 Chips per discard, potentially useful). The Judgement card is tempting, but I can't buy it without selling a Joker. I'm not keen on that gamble, especially when considering Gros Michel's +15 Multi. Banner looks underwhelming compared to my Blue Joker.\n\nThe shop reroll cost is $7, which I can afford without any interest concerns. Interest cap is usually $25. Reroll Surplus voucher means I can safely max out interest.\n\nSo, here's my thought process: I really want to find a Planet Joker, ideally Jupiter (Flush level). Alternatively, a significant upgrade to Gros Michel would be welcome. I'm prioritizing the Perkeo + Moon combo. I'm already in a good position for Ante 5, with my current Flushes.\n\nI initially thought I could maximize Judgement but I already have 5 jokers.\nI've already rerolled multiple times in this shop. The shop items haven't been great, so I think I might have hit a good stopping point.\n\nSo, should I stick with the plan? The shop items are weak, and my setup is solid. I can afford another reroll.\nThe current turn is 117.\n\nRerolling again would be fine; however, I should just move on.\n\nThe main goal is to win the run.\nI'm confident in my Flushes.\nI am at Big Blind or Boss.\nAnte 5 requirement roughly 10k-20k.\nMy runs are easily ~10k-12k.\nI'm safe.\n\nUltimately, I've decided to reroll one more time to fish for a better Joker. I'll stick with that.\n\n**Final Decision: Reroll one more time.**\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
