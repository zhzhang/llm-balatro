{"reasoning":"**The Perkeo Flush Loop**\n\nOkay, so Ante 7, Round 17. Time to plan this shop phase. I have $71, and the Mega Celestial Pack is down to its last selection. I have a Droll Joker, Ramen, The Tribe, and Stuntman, all supporting my Flush strategy, and crucially, Perkeo. Perkeo is my key: I *need* to hold onto Jupiter to clone it at the end of the shop, keeping my Flush level maxed.\n\nMy hand's already a Level 6 Flush, thanks to the Jupiter I have in inventory. I already picked Saturn (Straight), so now it's Level 5. My remaining options from this pack are: Mercury (Pair, Level 2), Venus (Three of a Kind, Level 4), Pluto (High Card, Level 3), and Uranus (Two Pair, Level 1). None are Jupiter, which is what I'm looking for.\n\nSince my Flush is primary, my secondary plan is to hit Three of a Kind or High Card. Straight is also an option, but it's already at level 5. Venus (Three of a Kind) seems the best choice here, since I could play it if I fail my Flush, which also gives me a decent bonus (+2 Mult and +20 Chips). Mercury gives +1/+15, Pluto gives +1/+10, and Uranus gives +1/+20, so Venus' bonuses are the best value, and easier to achieve than Straight if the Flush fails.\n\nSo, I will select Venus from the pack. That's position 2. No, wait, I *have* to hold onto the Jupiter! Don't play it. Action: `select 2`. That's it, Three of a Kind it is. Time to move on and loop this hand!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
