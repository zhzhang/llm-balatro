{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 14, Ante 6. I've got $26 to work with in the SHOP phase. My current Joker setup is pretty decent, but always room for improvement. I have Gros Michel, which is my main multiplier, the Egg, a $40 sell value joker, Droll Joker (which is great on a Flush), Perkeo (Duplicate consumable which will copy The Moon), and Blue Joker, a +94 chip generator.  Consumable is \"The Moon\", which I will use later to help me get clubs.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Mars card for 4OAK is useless for my strategy, and the Red Card for skipped boosters is also useless since I'm not skipping boosters. Joker Stencil is also useless because all my Joker slots are full. Rerolling the shop seems like the obvious play here, especially since it only costs $3.\n\nI'm hoping to snag a better Joker, maybe a significant +Chips or xMult, or potentially a planet card like Jupiter, which would be excellent. Perkeo will clone The Moon after I leave the shop. This means I don't need to do anything with the Moon consumable for now.\n\nThe JSON format is on my mind. I need to make sure the output is correct. I am going to call reroll_shop. This is a very cheap move at $3.\n\nMy plan: I'm going to reroll the shop. This will cost me $3, so I will have $23 remaining. I will submit the following:\n\n`{\"action\": \"reroll_shop\"}`\n\nI double checked my schema, to make sure this would be valid.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
