{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Decision: Reroll for Consistency**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, Round 6, with $33 in the bank. I've got the \"Reroll Surplus\" voucher, which is handy. The main play here is centered around my Perkeo/The Moon combo for consistent Flushes. I want to make sure I don't screw this up.\n\nI have a solid Joker lineup: Gros Michel for a flat +15 mult, Egg for scaling economy, Droll Joker for a massive Flush boost (and the all-important Polychrome x1.5 multiplier!), Perkeo (my key!), and Delayed Gratification for a little extra cash. I also have \"The Moon\" consumable, which is *perfect* for Perkeo because it converts cards to clubs.\n\nThe strategy hinges on Perkeo copying the Moon to give me a negative copy. That means, after the shop, I have a powerful play that is almost guaranteed. $33 is plenty to spare, so buying anything else is probably not worth it.\n\nMy first thought was to get hanging chad, but I don't really have the cards that take advantage of that Joker. Also, I can't currently *use* The Moon in the shop (I tried to confirm this), so it's all about setting up the next round. Rerolling is only $3, so it's smart to see what else is on offer. The main goal of a reroll is to find a Jupiter, or perhaps something equally useful (another Planet, etc.).\n\nI've checked the Joker scoring order. Droll Joker (Polychrome) *must* be last in the line because its multiplier is the most important piece. The current order is fine: additive mults before multiplicative mults. So, since the economy is good, I will reroll once. I'm going to commit to this reroll and hope to find something essential.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
