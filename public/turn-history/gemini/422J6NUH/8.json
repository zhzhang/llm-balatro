{"reasoning":"**My Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the SHOP phase after snagging that \"Egg\" Joker from a Buffoon Pack. Let's break down the situation. I've got $5, and two Jokers: \"Gros Michel,\" which is a beast with +15 Mult and a chance to bust, and the \"Egg,\" which is going to be banking me cash as the rounds progress.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see a Celestial Pack for $4 and an Overstock Voucher for a whopping $10. Considering I'm about to clear the Ante 1 Big Blind requirement of 450 chips with a High Card + the Gros Michel multi (and a Pair will do the job even easier), the level-up from the Celestial Pack isn't strictly necessary right now.\n\nMy initial thought was to buy the Celestial Pack, but that would leave me with only $1 and miss out on that crucial $1 interest. At this point, the \"Egg\" is helping on economy and \"Gros Michel\" is plenty for scoring. I've got to remember to manage my resources efficiently. So, I need to evaluate the choices: Buy the Celestial Pack for $4, or re-roll for $5. I am going to keep my current $5 to generate interest, as it makes for good economy. Rerolling would be a waste of money. I’m really just trying to figure out if I can get a level-up, but it's not the end of the world if I don't.\n\nNow, wait a minute, I didn't see any other cards in the shop and there is one Celestial pack left, which is not strictly required. The voucher is out of the question.\n\nOkay, I'm sticking with my initial strategy. My action will be to move to round select, as the Celestial Pack isn't strictly necessary. No need to overthink this. Then the prompt asks for JSON to go to Blind Select.\n\nWait... looking at the previous turns, I see that I have been saving for interest. I will stick with that. Saving the $5 for the interest is better than the Celestial Pack, which may give a planet level up. My command is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
