{"reasoning":"**My Game Plan: Ante 4, Shop Phase - Flush Focused**\n\nOkay, here we are in the shop at Ante 4, Round 8, with $44 in my pocket. My primary goal is to keep my Flush build running smoothly and secure a win for future rounds. I have a solid Flush strategy centered around Clubs thanks to \"The Moon,\" and I'm looking to optimize my Joker setup. Let's see...\n\nI've got a decent lineup already: Gros Michel, Egg (worth $22 if I need the cash), Droll (a solid Flush multiplier), Perkeo (Legendary, clones consumables), and Crafty Joker (chips generator). The two Moons are a good setup for a Club-based strategy.\n\nPerkeo's ability to create a negative copy of a consumable at the shop's end is crucial here. I have two Moons, which doesn't hurt me. It'll give me a third Moon, potentially offering me more flexibility in the coming rounds.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the shop options. Earth (Planet, Full House) is irrelevant for this Flush-focused build. \"Ride the Bus\" is a no-go since my Flushes use face cards; the joker gets stronger when you don't play them. Standard and Mega Standard Packs are tempting, but I already have a Moon to get Clubs. The 'Magic Trick' voucher isn't particularly valuable right now unless I'm hunting for something very specific.\n\nI have $44 to spend. Jupiter would be the ideal Planet card to level my Flush. Or better Jokers! I can sell the Egg to get more money if needed.\n\nReroll, here I come! It's only $3, and it's my best bet to find a Jupiter or a Joker.\n\nA quick check on my Joker order: I need to maximize additive Mult, then xMult, then Chips. So: Gros Michel, Droll (with its Polychrome bonus and x1.5 multiplier), Perkeo, and Crafty. The Crafty is a Chips generator that will combine its Chips with the Multiplier Jokers to get a final score.\n\nBefore I reroll, I'm going to double-check Perkeo again. Yes, it creates a third Moon. I am solid in my planning.\n\nOkay, let's see what's on the table after a reroll...\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
