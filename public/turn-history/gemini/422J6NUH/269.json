{"reasoning":"**Analysis Paralysis in the Shop**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 8, final ante, and I'm in the shop. I've got $14, a $9 reroll, and this is the make-or-break moment. I'm flush-focused with a strong Joker setup: Tribe, Droll, Ramen, Stuntman, and Brainstorm.  I’ve got one Judgement consumable.\n\nLet's break down the shop offerings.  Greedy Joker? Useless for this build. Uranus? Nope, not a Two Pair build. Supernova? Hmmm, it's +25 Mult, but my Droll Joker already gives +10 Mult *and* a 1.5x Polychrome, so Supernova is a sidegrade, maybe even a downgrade. Math Check: Droll is better. Business Card? No scoring value here.\n\nRerolling would leave me with $5, and while I *could* get lucky with a Jupiter, the odds seem slim. I've already rerolled twice this shop. $14 isn’t enough to safely buy a good card after a reroll. \n\nThe Big Blind is typically a hefty amount, and the bosses are even bigger. My current setup gives around 200k per Flush. The Wall boss is 720k, Violet Vessel is 1.2M. I need multiple Flushes to beat those, or a serious upgrade. Stuntman’s hand size penalty makes this harder.\n\nI *could* sell Judgement for $1, but it's not worth it. I need my current synergisitic Jokers.\n\nOkay, let's step back. Rerolling is a gamble. The shop is underwhelming. The diminishing returns are hitting hard. I could find a game-changer Tarot card, but the odds are too low.\n\nLooking at the numbers: Around 480 chips, 432 Mult, that's over 200k per hand. I can handle the Big Blind, but the bosses are dicey, especially with the hand size reduction.\n\nSo, here's the final decision point: Reroll for $9, leaving me with $5, or move on to the next round with $14. I've been specifically hunting for Jupiter.\n\nWait…let's double-check. Actually, let me analyze the cards one more time. Supernova is probably strictly worse. Droll is a must-keep.\n\nOkay, I'm going to Round Select. I've spent enough time here, and I need that cash for the next shop. I can get some better Jokers next round.\n\nI *could* sell Judgement, but no.\n\nI'm checking my Joker setup one last time to confirm my Joker abilities:\nTribe: X2 on flush.\nDroll: +10 Mult if Flush.\nBrainstorm copies the leftmost Joker.\nRamen: X2.\nCurrent setup is fine, Brainstorming either the Tribe or the Ramen for maximum value.\n\nFinal Check: Could I use Judgement? I’d have to sell a Joker. No way. Tribe, Droll, Ramen, Stuntman, Brainstorm: they’re all critical. Keep Judgement in the back pocket for money later.\n\n**Action: `round_select`**\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
