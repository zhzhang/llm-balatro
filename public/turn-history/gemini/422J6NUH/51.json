{"reasoning":"**Strategic Poker Thinking**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 3, Round 6, Big Blind is next. I've got $30, a solid Flush build, and a few key Jokers. My core strategy is Flush-focused, with Perkeo to duplicate \"The Moon\" for infinite Flushes. I need to make the optimal decision this turn.\n\nFirst, let's assess my Jokers. Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and Delayed Gratification. The x1.5 multiplier on Droll Joker is important, I need to ensure that it triggers at the very end of the sequence. However, in this particular lineup, its position doesn't actually affect the scoring sequence, because the last two Jokers don't add Mult. So, current order is fine.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the shop options. I can't *use* Strength right away, because it requires targeting cards, and I am in the Shop, not the Round. Perkeo copies consumables, and I have a Moon. But *if* I buy Strength, there is a 50% chance it copies that rather than Moon. I absolutely want the Moon to be duplicated so I can ensure my Flush engine. So I need to ignore Strength.\n\nOdd Todd is tempting (+31 chips for odd cards), but I'm Joker-locked. I'd have to sell a Joker. Delayed Gratification for Odd Todd? DG gives $2 per round, which is probably more important than the flat chip boost. I think the chip boost is less valuable, right now.\n\nRerolling the shop is an option. I'm hunting for Jupiter (Flush Planet) to upgrade my hand. At $4, it's affordable, and I'm still maxing out interest, right? Reroll cost is $4, with Reroll Surplus active, which is a sweet discount. But is it the best use of my action this turn?\n\nI've already rearranged my Jokers. I know that rerolling will be the most impactful action. I need to get as many Moon copies as possible. Perkeo is the core. I can \"safely\" reroll to look for Jupiter, because I'm not dipping below the interest cap.\n\nHowever, I just had a thought. Why *not* trigger Perkeo *now*? End shop to get a copy of the Moon. This is the optimal play because I can ensure infinite Moon copies.\n\nI will `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
