{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante, Optimizing the Shop**\n\nAlright, I'm in the thick of it – Shop phase, Ante 7, Round 18. Got $74, a solid Joker suite (Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, and Stuntman), and Saturn, the Straight level-up consumable, but my build is all about Flushes. The goal? Nail \"The Flint\" boss blind with its nasty chip and mult reduction.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are, how can I maximize Perkeo's duplication power? I've got a Saturn, but I'd much rather duplicate a Jupiter for Flush leveling or a Tarot for deck manipulation. The Arcana Pack is only $3, which seems the most logical first step.\n\nThe \"Flint\" boss is the key, halving my base chip and mult. My base Flush is around 36k, but that drops to a measly 70 chips, 9 mult. My ideal situation is finding a Jupiter to pump up my Flush strength or some helpful Tarot to hold for Perkeo.\n\nI need to quickly figure out how to best find a useful card for Perkeo to duplicate.\n\nAfter assessing my options, I have to open the Arcana Pack first. I have enough money, so the $3 for the pack isn't a problem, and the value of having a strong card for Perkeo is paramount.\n\nThe plan now is: open the Arcana Pack to give my deck a boost, and then reroll the shop to hopefully find a Jupiter or a good Tarot in a card slot.\n\nMy shop strategy is now the following:\n1.  Buy the Arcana Pack, assess what's inside.\n2.  If nothing useful appears for Perkeo, reroll the shop.\n\nI'm checking if buying the Arcana pack and using it is indeed the best next move.\n\nNow I remember, the key here is I'm trying to hold a card in my inventory for Perkeo to duplicate, so I'm hoping I can find a Tarot that I can add to my current consumable, Saturn.\n\nI double-check again the Flint calculations. With my jokers and hand, two Flushes should win this round barely. Any small improvements will give me a very safe win.\n\nNow, checking the shop again. There's Supernova and Luchador in the card slots. The Arcana Pack is a good opportunity since I can hope to get a card, if I have space, to add to my current consumable, Saturn. I can also then look to reroll for Jupiter. So, `buy_booster 1`.\n\nLet me think. I just checked the shop again, it's just Supernova and Luchador, and the Arcana Pack booster, so `buy_booster 1` makes sense.\n\nNow I am going to rearrange the Jokers to ensure that I maximize their power. I need to make sure that the +mult from Droll happens before the Xmult. I can also verify that the +250 chips from Stuntman are applied before the multiplications. Finally, the best setup is to keep the original order:\n1.  Droll\n2.  Ramen\n3.  Tribe\n4.  Perkeo\n5.  Stuntman\n\nOkay, everything checks out, let's open that Arcana Pack with `buy_booster 1`!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
