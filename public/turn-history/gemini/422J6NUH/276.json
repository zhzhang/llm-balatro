{"reasoning":"**Final Ante, Time to Optimize**\n\nAlright, it's the final ante, Round 21, and I'm sitting on $15. My goal, as always, is to maximize my score for this final boss with my established Flush build. I'm currently at Level 13, with 215 chips and 28 mult. The Jokers are dialed in: The Tribe (x2 Flush), Droll Joker (Polychrome: +10 Mult Flush, x1.5), Ramen (x2, loses mult on discard), Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size), and Brainstorm (Copies Tribe -> x2 Flush).\n\nDoing the math, a quick estimate of the expected score is around 212,040, which is well above the usual boss requirements. I am confident of the build strength.\n\nI'm looking at the shop, but am now debating if it is even worth it.\n\n*   **Fortune Teller ($4):** +30 Mult seems tempting, but I have to consider replacing something. Droll is a bad choice, and swapping Ramen is too much of a hit to the base multiplier. It's probably not worth it.\n*   **Venus ($2):** Three of a Kind? No thanks, I'm Flush focused.\n*   **The Family ($6):** x4 Four of a Kind. Irrelevant.\n*   **Sock and Buskin ($4):** Retriggering face cards might be okay, but I don't have enough synergy effects to make it worth the Joker slot.\n*   **Standard Pack ($3):** It's cheap, I can afford the reroll cost ($4).\n\nI have a history of buying packs and rerolling. Should I keep doing it? I am on my way to winning.\n\nMy initial thought is to go for the Standard Pack first, as it could give me a Glass card or a Purple Seal.\n\nMy strategy is normally to enter the final round, but let's check \"Sock and Buskin\".\nBase King chip is 10. * 456 mult = 4,560 extra score. Not worth a joker slot, and I have no other retrigger benefits.\n\nSince the pack is cheap, I can buy that first.\n\nWait, since I have money, I will keep trying to improve by buying the pack.\n\nAction: `buy_booster`, position `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
