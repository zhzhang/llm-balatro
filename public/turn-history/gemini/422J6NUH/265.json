{"reasoning":"**Ante 8 Shop Analysis**\n\nOkay, here we are in the Shop phase of Ante 8, Round 20. I've got $24 to work with. My current Joker setup looks pretty solid: The Tribe (X2 Mult if Flush), Droll Joker (+10 Mult if Flush, X1.5 Mult), Ramen (X2 Mult), Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size), and Brainstorm (copying The Tribe). I also have a Judgement consumable, but my Joker slots are full.\n\nLet's do a quick calculation of the potential score. The Level 12 Flush gives me a base of 200 chips and 26 mult. Stuntman is adding 250 chips. If we assume a card value of approximately 50 chips per card, we are looking at roughly 500 chips. The base mult is 26 from the Flush plus 10 from Droll equals 36. My X mults come from Brainstorm (copying Tribe), The Tribe, Droll, and Ramen, giving a total of 12x. So, roughly, each hand should be worth around 500 chips * 36 mult * 12x = 216,000. That's well above what I need to clear an Ante 8 Boss, which is usually in the 100k-200k range.\n\nI just double-checked that Brainstorm is indeed copying The Tribe at position 1. Copying Ramen gives the same result. The current Joker arrangement is definitely optimized.\n\nLooking at the shop cards, though, they're not very appealing: Misprint is RNG, To Do List is for Two Pair, and 8 Ball for 8s. Not what I'm looking for. I need something that will improve my Flush level or provide a significant multiplier. My money situation is $24, and a reroll costs $6.\n\nThe Judgement consumable is interesting, but I can't use it because my Joker slots are full. I could sell it for $1 to free up a slot, but I am unsure if it is worth the gamble.\n\nMy setup is strong, so I have a few options. I could reroll the shop to search for a Jupiter Planet card to boost my Flush even further, or a useful Tarot or Spectre. Alternatively, I could just proceed to the next round if I feel confident enough. Actually, the last hand was only 87,552 chips, so that is not what I am looking for. My 216,000 calculation seems safe, so that's good.\n\nSo, the action is going to be `reroll_shop` to search for something better, specifically a Jupiter or maybe a useful Tarot or Spectre. Or, maybe sell Judgement to have the space.\n\n*Wait*, maybe I should sell Judgement first since I have an open consumable slot. But, if I buy a pack I might want the space. Actually, I have an open slot.\nThe player just rearranged, I wonder if they are going to search. Given the stage, rerolling to find a Jupiter is the most standard play.\n\nChecking to confirm that The Tribe at position 1 is the best copy target: (26 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 432 mult or: (26 + 10 + 10) * 1.5 * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 414. So, yes, The Tribe is the best.\n\nThe shop cards are still poor. The decision is: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
