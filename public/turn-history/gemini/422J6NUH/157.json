{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop & Making the Right Play**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, Round 14. Sitting on $37 with a solid Joker lineup: Gros Michel for Multiplier, Egg for a nice sell value, Droll Joker for Flush Multiplier, Perkeo which is key, and Blue Joker for those sweet chips. The Moon consumable is doing the heavy lifting by converting cards to Clubs.\n\nThe shop is decent. Mars is a no-go since I'm not running 4 of a Kind. Red Card isn't optimal either, because I'm using boosters, not skipping them. Joker Stencil is a waste of money, my Joker slots are full. The Blank Voucher is an interesting long-term play for Antimatter. And, of course, the Jumbo Arcana Pack is a priority to try and find some deck manipulation or consumables. I'm focusing on Flushes (Clubs) and Perkeo to duplicate \"The Moon\" for some deck fixing.\n\nWith $37, the first buy is obvious: the Jumbo Arcana Pack. That's Position 1 in the Shop Boosters and costs $4. This leaves me with $33 after the purchase. After that, I'll likely buy the Blank Voucher, and then select the next round.\n\nI need to confirm there is nothing else to do before I buy the booster pack.\n\nPerkeo triggers at the end of the shop phase, so the order of operations is fine. Buying the pack won't interfere with \"The Moon\" duplication, since I can still Perkeo.\n\nI have enough room for consumables, since Perkeo grants me a +1 slot and \"The Moon\" being negative doesn't take a slot anyway, and I have Max Consumables 3.\n\nNo other actions before the pack.\n\nSo, the action is `buy_booster` with position `1`.\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
