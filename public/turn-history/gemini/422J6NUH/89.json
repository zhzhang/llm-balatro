{"reasoning":"**My Pre-Round Thoughts**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 4, Round 9 – Big Blind time. Let's see, I've got $27. Shop phase. My strategy is centered around a Flush build, which is at level 4 – and has significant potential.\n\nThe key players in my setup are: Gros Michel, which adds +15 Mult; Egg, for money; Droll Joker, which is a monster with +10 Mult on Flushes and a 1.5x Multiplier, further enhanced by its Polychrome bonus (another 1.5x Multiplier); Perkeo, the copycat; and Blue Joker, adding a whopping +92 Chips. I'm also carrying two \"The Moon\" consumables that turn three cards into Clubs. These are vital for setting up Flushes.\n\nI grabbed that 6 of Clubs with a Blue Seal previously, so I'm guaranteed a Jupiter planet at the end of the round.\n\nLet's assess the shop. Business Card is tempting for later but not crucial. Magic Trick? Not usually worth it this early unless I'm desperate for specific cards. Money-wise, I'm sitting pretty at $27 with a $25 interest cap. The big question is: do I reroll? It costs $3, dropping me to $24 and costing me $1 in interest. I'm leaning against it. Perkeo will copy one of my \"The Moon\" cards, so I am good for consumables.\n\nLet's make sure that I am set up correctly, here is my Joker setup: The current order is: Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, Blue Joker. Scoring goes left to right. Now, let's look at the additive vs multiplicative stuff. The order matters! I have Gros Michel (+15) and Droll (+10) - but the x multipliers happen at the *end*.\n\nSo, it's just a matter of ensuring the +Mult jokers are to the left of the xMult jokers of *the same card*. Since Droll has both in one, it's fine.\n\nNow, let's see, do I need to move the Blue Joker? No, chips get applied before the mult. Perkeo or Egg? Nope. Those don't affect the score calculation. Current order is Gros Michel (1), Egg (2), Droll (3), Perkeo (4), Blue Joker (5).\n\nIf I hit a Flush, I'm calculating (172 + cards) * 35 * 2.25. Which is ~172 * 78.75, which comes out to ~13,545 chips. I easily clear the blind.\n\nSo, here's the final check. I have $27, if I reroll I'm at $24. Worth the $1 interest? No. The Perkeo copy is good.\n\nShould I sell Egg? No, I want that scaling interest.\n\nI'm happy with my consumables. I have Perkeo to trigger. The \"The Moon\" cards will be triggered by Perkeo. No point in buying Magic Trick. I should *save* my Moon cards for when I can guarantee a Flush.\n\nOkay, I think I'm done. I *will* double-check my Joker order. All good. And my consumable status. I have two \"The Moon\", so room for two more.\n\n*Self-Correction*: The Joker Order is correct.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\nTo recap: Blue Joker is bought. I have enough chips to clear. Joker order is optimized. Money is good for interest, and Perkeo is good.\n\nNo need to buy anything in the shop at $27. I have a Blue Seal card in hand, so this is good. Rerolling is not needed, so this is fine.\n\n*Final Check*: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
