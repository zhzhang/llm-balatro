{"reasoning":"**Analysis of a High-Stakes Hand**\n\nOkay, so I'm in a Spectral Pack at Ante 7, Round 16, running a Flush build – Droll Joker, The Tribe, Jupiter at level 5. This is where things get interesting. I've got Stuntman reducing my hand size to six, and I'm currently holding six cards: a Gold 10 of Spades, two Aces of Clubs, a 10 of Clubs, a 5 of Clubs, and a 2 of Clubs. My jokers are solid: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, and Perkeo for consumables. The real question is: Deja Vu or Incantation?\n\nDeja Vu adds a Red Seal. It's generally strong, especially with triggers, but Gold cards, now that I re-examined the card text, *do* benefit from retriggering the Red Seal, granting the money benefit twice. Incantation is risky. It destroys a random card but adds four enhanced numbered cards. The randomness is dangerous, considering I'm trying to hit a flush with those five Clubs.\n\nLet's break it down. Applying Deja Vu to an Ace of Clubs for a potential enhancement down the line is decent. It increases both the chips and mult. A Red Seal on the Gold 10 of Spades is attractive for the extra money, but I'm not sure if money is the bottleneck here. My money total is $91. However, I have Stuntman already for chips, and the Joker Mult is already 132. It might not be the best idea.\n\nHowever, Incantation could give me more clubs or useful enhancements, which is tempting.\n\nDeja Vu is the safer, more controlled play. Getting a Red Seal on a scoring card is powerful in the long run. Since I'm running a flush build, the Ace of Clubs would be good to score the flush with.\n\nAfter reviewing the cards again, it looks like:\n10 of Spades (Gold)\nAce of Clubs\nAce of Clubs\n10 of Clubs\n5 of Clubs\n2 of Clubs\n\nThe 10 of Spades is the only non-Club. Using Deja Vu on an Ace of Clubs helps scoring. Using Deja Vu on 10 of Spades (Gold) gives more money ($6 total).\n\nBut scoring is the key thing, at Ante 7. The Stuntman and Jokers make chips a non-issue. I think I'll stick with a *predictable* choice.\n\nGiven this, I'm going to choose Deja Vu and apply it to the Ace of Clubs in the second position in my hand. That will let me build the value of the Flush (Clubs).\n\nCommand: `select 1 2`\n`select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position>`\n`pack_card_position`: 1 (Deja Vu)\n`hand_card_position`: 2 (Ace of Clubs)\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,2]"}
