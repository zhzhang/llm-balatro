{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment and Action Plan**\n\nAlright, let's take stock of this situation. Ante 3, round 8, and the boss, The Psychic, is demanding 5 cards be played. I'm starting with zero chips, and need to score 4000. My current hand is Q♠, 8♠, 6♠, 3♠, 10♥, 5♥, 6♦, 2♦. I've got a solid foundation for a flush with 4 Spades, but need that fifth card or some Clubs, considering the deck composition has more Clubs than Spades. My jokers are Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($ value), Droll (+10 Mult on Flush, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (Legendary, clones consumables), and Crafty Joker (+80 Chips on Flush). I also have two copies of The Moon.\n\nMy primary strategy is aiming for a Flush, which is a level 4 play style worth 80 chips and 10 mult. The Crafty Joker adds 80 Chips, Gros Michel bumps the mult by 15, and Droll gives another 10 mult. The droll also multiplies by 1.5, which is huge! I estimate the chips to be around 190 and the mult to be 52.5, resulting in a score far exceeding my 4000 target.\n\nThe Psychic's constraint is key: I *must* play 5 cards. Given my current hand, the optimal move is to discard the non-Spades to fish for that elusive fifth Spade or a Club to make a flush with The Moon. The discard would be: 10♥, 5♥, 6♦, and 2♦. It’s also important to remember that I have 4 discards, so this gives me a good chance of drawing into a winning hand!\n\nI have to verify the joker placement for maximum gains. Droll Joker, with its 1.5 multiplier, *must* be positioned after any additive multipliers like Gros Michel to maximize the value. My current layout has Gros Michel at position 1 and Droll at position 3, which is optimal for the current setup. Perkeo is creating negatives of The Moon, so it might be best to save them for a later play, if it comes to that. My current deck has 15 Clubs and only 8 Spades, so the odds are also in my favor.\n\nI’m going to discard the four non-spades: 10♥, 5♥, 6♦, and 2♦, which should give me the 5th spade, or allow for a strong play with The Moon, or even a basic Flush. The negative moons I save with Perkeo could let me make even more amazing plays later.\n\nFinal Action: Discard the non-Spades at positions 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8]"}
