{"reasoning":"**Ante 8 Decision Time**\n\nOkay, Ante 8, Round 20, Blind Select phase. Big Blind at 75,000 chips, Boss coming up needing 100,000. I have $14, one Judgement consumable, and a decent joker setup: The Tribe (X2 Flush), Droll (+10 Mult for Flush, Polychrome X1.5), Ramen (X2 Mult, minus 0.01 per discard), Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size), and Brainstorm (Copies leftmost).\n\nMy Flush is at level 12, generating 200 chips and 26 mult. Last time, I scored 87,552 chips, beating the Small Blind.\n\nIf I play this round, I can easily clear the 75k and 100k thresholds. Let's ballpark the numbers: ~505 chips * ~432 mult = roughly 218,160 total, comfortably exceeding both blinds. That's assuming I pull a decent hand, of course.\n\nThe choice is simple: skip, or play. Skipping gives me a Double Tag but I miss the shop, money, and go straight to the Boss. Playing gives me money ($4 base + ~$3 hands + ~$2 interest = ~$9) and a shop visit before the Boss.\n\nThis is the *final* Ante! There is no next round. So the Double Tag is essentially worthless for this run, unless I'm shooting for Endless mode, which I'm not. The shop visit is significantly more valuable to find Jupiter (Flush leveling) or other buffs. I'm almost certain I can beat the Boss's 100,000 chip requirement. It's shockingly low for Ante 8, usually it's higher. Re-reading, yes, it's 100,000. Easy peasy.\n\nDiscarding slightly decreases Ramen's multiplier, but I have enough mult that I can avoid discarding too much.\n\nMy current joker order is optimal: The Tribe, Droll, Ramen, Stuntman, Brainstorm (copying Tribe). The X mult is: X2 * X1.5 * X2 * X2 = X12. Trying other setups, it's not possible to beat this.\n\nTherefore, the shop is critical here, and the Double Tag is inconsequential.\n\nMy action is `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
