{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment of Booster Pack - Skip Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 11, with a $77 bankroll. The ante is at 5, and it's BUFFOON_PACK time. My core strategy is a Flush deck, and it's Level 4. I'm running with Gros Michel for a solid Mult boost, Droll Joker which synergizes perfectly with my Flush with +10 Mult/x1.5 Mult, Blue Joker for solid Chip generation, and Perkeo, which is key to my strategy by copying my The Moon consumable. The Egg is just there for its sell value. I've got a full house in terms of Jokers - 5/5 slots filled.\n\nLet's dive into these pack choices:\n\n1.  **Wee Joker:** Nah, +8 Chips for every 2 isn't worth it. Blue Joker already gives me +92 Chips and it's consistent.\n2.  **Zany Joker:** No, this is for Three of a Kind, not my Flush strategy. Useless.\n3.  **Credit Card:** Going into debt is never part of my plan. Hard pass.\n4.  **Crazy Joker:** Straight mult, not Flush mult, so useless.\n\nNow, none of these options are even remotely an upgrade. I'd have to sell a perfectly useful Joker to get one of these, which isn't happening. I really should have bought that \"Red Card\" in the shop earlier - it would have given me +3 Mult for skipping a pack, but it's too late for that.\n\nI have to choose between keeping the build and selling. I could sell the Egg for $31, which is not smart for now. Selling Gros Michel would only get me a small payout.\n\nIs there any value in Wee Joker? It's Rare, so it sells for more. Gros Michel sells for $2, Wee Joker would sell for ~$4. So, there is a small profit, but selling and buying is too slow for me.\n\nMy available actions are to `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, `sell_joker`, `select`, or `skip_booster`. Given that none of these jokers are better than what I have, and I have to sell something to get them, skipping this pack is clearly the most straightforward and best decision, to avoid messing up the current build.\n\nI could see if any good items are available after the pack. The shop had Banner, Red Card, and The Sun. None are particularly exciting at this moment.\n\nTherefore, `skip_booster` is the cleanest and most efficient move. It's the best option here.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
