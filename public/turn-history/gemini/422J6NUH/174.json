{"reasoning":"**Optimization for the Next Round**\n\nAlright, let's get down to brass tacks. Round 15, Ante 6, and I'm sitting on $115. My objective is crystal clear: maximize the chip output this round. I've got a solid Joker lineup: Gros Michel, Droll Joker, Perkeo, Blue Joker, and Ramen. Plus, the Jupiter consumable is ready to go, and I have one empty consumable slot.\n\nMy immediate focus is on optimizing my current setup for maximum chip generation. The core strategy hinges on playing a Flush or Straight Flush, both already at Level 4. I need to squeeze every last bit of value out of this hand.\n\nFirst, let's break down the Jokers. Gros Michel offers +15 Mult (with a risk, though I'll manage it), Droll Joker adds +10 Mult to Flushes and a 1.5x Multiplier if it's Polychrome, Blue Joker is a chip factory at +94 Chips, Ramen dishes out a 2x Multiplier, and then there is Perkeo.\n\nI need to make sure to save Jupiter, and be sure to use it to optimize for the next round. If Perkeo creates a Negative copy of Jupiter at the shop's end, I do not want to use Jupiter.\n\nNow, the shop. The Rocket is tempting with its Foil bonus, but Blue Joker already outclasses it in chip output. The 8 Ball and Celestial Pack are less compelling this round.\n\nConsidering my current Joker order is Gros Michel, Droll Joker, Perkeo, Blue Joker, and Ramen, the plan is to buy the Celestial Pack to level up hands. The key is to arrange the Jokers so that the chip-generating and +Mult effects are applied before the xMult effects for maximum return. I see that the correct order is Blue Joker, Gros Michel, Droll Joker, Ramen, Perkeo.\n\nI'm ready to buy the Celestial Pack. Then rearrange the Jokers.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
