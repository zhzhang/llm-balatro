{"reasoning":"**Shop Dilemma: Perkeo or Brainstorm?**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the final shop before the Ante 8 boss. My goal is simple: maximize that Flush build I've got going. Currently, I've got $24 and a decent Joker setup: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, and Stuntman. My Flush level is 12, so a base of 200 chips and 26 mult.\n\nBrainstorm is staring me down from the shop, and it's a top-tier joker, because it copies my leftmost joker. My current leftmost is Droll, which gives +10 mult and x1.5 mult. I can get more from Brainstorm, I need to work out what I want it to copy. The question is, which joker do I sell to make room? Perkeo, the legendary Joker, clones the consumable, but I have Judgement now. It's not the best effect for the stage, and while it would be great to stack more copies of the same planet/tarot, the cloning won't matter here.\n\nLet's look at the numbers. Brainstorm could copy The Tribe (x2), Ramen (x2, assuming it's still at x2), or even Stuntman (+250 chips). But the optimal play here is copying The Tribe. If I sell Perkeo, buy Brainstorm, and rearrange, I can get: (26 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 432.\n\nBut, if I don't buy Brainstorm, I have: (26 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 216. That's a huge jump. It's basically doubling my score.\n\nHowever, I can only take one action per turn. So here's what I need to do: Sell Perkeo.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
