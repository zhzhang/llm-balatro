{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Execution: The Mark Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 5, round 14. I'm up against \"The Mark,\" and I need 22,000 chips. I'm currently at 19,005, meaning I need about 2,995 more, and I've only got two hands left. The Boss effect of flipping cards face down after a hand is played is annoying, but irrelevant for *this* round since we are about to win. The next action is the Shop, so I'm safe.\n\nI have some key Jokers: Gros Michel (big mult), Egg (value), Droll (more mult on a Flush), Perkeo (consumable copy), and Blue Joker (chips per card). I have two \"The Moon\" consumables that can convert cards to Clubs. Let's see what I'm working with:\n\nMy hand consists of: Jack of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs (bonus), 6 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, 8 of Diamonds, 7 of Diamonds, 2 of Diamonds. I've got a lot of Clubs already, but I need a Flush to be sure.\n\nMy initial thought was to use one \"The Moon\" to convert some cards to Clubs, get a Flush, and win. But wait, I have two \"The Moon\" cards. I'm thinking I can convert the Jack and 3 of Hearts with Moon, then convert 8 of Diamonds and then I have a club flush! I can use the consumables on positions 1, 2, and 6. Then I can play it as a flush:\n\nClubs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Jack, 3, 9, 6, 2).\n\nSo, let's calculate. A Flush Level 4 gives 80 chips. The Blue Joker adds +38, the 9 of Clubs gives +30 bonus. The card values (Jack, 3, 9, 6, 2) total 30. That's 178 chips total. Mult: Base 10 + Gros Michel 15 + Droll 10 = 35 mult, times the Polychrome 1.5 = 52.5 mult. 178 * 52.5 = 9345 chips. Okay, 9345 is more than the required 2,995 chips.\n\nThis works. \n\nI'm thinking ahead to the next round, and how Perkeo works at the end of the *shop*. Using one \"The Moon\" in this round is fine because Perkeo will copy the remaining Moon at the end of the next shop. Great, this gives me good synergy.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Action:** Use \"The Moon\" on cards at positions 1, 2, and 6 to get the flush.\n\nSo the first action is `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 1, 2, 6]}`\n\nNow I play the hand.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,1,2,6]"}
