{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop: Prioritizing Synergy and Value**\n\nOkay, Ante 5, Round 11, we're in the shop. I've got $40, and the Flush strategy is working well. My jokers are Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and Blue Joker. The Moon consumable is key for converting cards to Clubs. Time to make some smart buys.\n\nThe goal is to maintain and enhance the Flush setup, focusing on Perkeo's consumable copy ability, and improve the current scoring.\n\nI've got a few things to consider. \"The Moon\" will be copied at the end of the shop. The Jumbo Arcana Pack is only $4, that's high value, and Jumbo Buffoon pack also cheap at $4. I need to ignore The Sun since I need Clubs for the strategy, and the Red Card is not useful now. Blue Joker looks better than Banner.\n\nI'm thinking: Buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack. Buy the Jumbo Buffoon Pack. And skip the rest.\n\nI should buy the packs now. I'll need to figure out the right order, though. Should I buy the Arcana or the Buffoon pack first?\n\nI think I'll start with the Arcana pack. It's \"Jumbo,\" so immediate use. The tarot cards could either provide modifications to cards or improve my economy, and I *need* immediate utility.\n\nSo, let's go with `buy_booster 2`. That's the Jumbo Arcana Pack.\n\nRight, the current game step is SHOP, so I can buy it now.\n\n`action`: \"buy_booster\"\n`positions`: [2]\n\nThat's the Jumbo Arcana Pack. I think this is a solid move. Although if I buy the Buffoon pack, I might find a better Joker to use instead of the Gros Michel or Egg joker. But Arcana's immediate utility is more attractive right now.\nLet's stick with the Arcana pack.\n`buy_booster 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
