{"reasoning":"**Current Round Strategy: Maximize Flush Scoring**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, Round 7 with $64 and maxed-out interest. The goal is clear: utilize the Flush build to score high. I have a solid foundation with my current Jokers: Gros Michel (+15 Mult, with a chance to break), Egg (economy, +$3/round and $19 sell value), Droll Joker (Polychrome, +10 Mult on Flush, x1.5 Mult), and Perkeo (clones consumables). The Moon consumable (3 cards to Clubs) is the key, which I can clone with Perkeo at the end of the shop.\n\nThe shop offers two choices: Crafty Joker and Astronomer. Crafty Joker is the clear winner here. I'm focusing on Flushes, and +80 chips on a Flush is absolutely massive. With a Level 4 Flush (80 chips base), Crafty's bonus will double my chip output to 160, for a total of 210 with card chips factored in. That, combined with my other Jokers, puts the theoretical score at 11,025 (210 chips \\* 35 mult \\* 1.5 multiplier), which is more than enough to beat the Ante 3 boss.\n\nAstronomer is tempting for long-term scaling, but right now, I'm all about setting up the \"The Moon\" cloning strategy. I have only one Joker slot open. Buying Crafty Joker fills that slot perfectly and gives me a great setup for a massive score. Gros Michel, Egg, Droll, Perkeo and Crafty Joker make a well rounded team.\n\nTherefore, the only thing to do is to buy Crafty Joker, which is in position 1 of the shop. I'll need to remember to keep \"The Moon\" in my inventory until the shop ends. So, action: buy_card, positions: 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
