{"reasoning":"**Here's the plan, and it's a solid one.** I'm in Round 18, facing \"The Flint\" boss blind, which is going to cut my chips and mult in half. I've got $71, a strong Flush build, and a few key Jokers. My goal is to maximize my score against the boss, and Perkeo is key to this.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure Perkeo duplicates a Hanged Man. Currently, I have Saturn (useless for Flush) and The Hanged Man. I need space, so I'm selling Saturn. This will give Perkeo a 100% chance to copy the Hanged Man at the end of the shop.\n\nThe Hanged Man is brilliant for deck thinning, getting rid of non-club cards for my Flush build. Then, I'll focus on getting the 6 of Clubs in my final hand, which has the Blue Seal that guarantees a Jupiter (Flush level up) on the final played hand of the round, and after that, Perkeo will duplicate that Jupiter.\n\nI'm checking the shop, there's a Luchador card, which would disable the boss. But, I cannot sell any of my Jokers (Stuntman, Droll, Ramen, Tribe, Perkeo). My Jokers are essential for my mult and chip output. Selling any would be a disaster. I can get two Flushes, and even with halved chips/mult, it's possible. I'll need some luck, but I think I can pull it off.\n\nI have decided to **sell Saturn** to free up the consumable slot for when Perkeo duplicates The Hanged Man. This guarantees I have a powerful hand. I want to see a Jupiter appear in a shop, but the 6 of Clubs guarantees it on my final hand, so I'm not stressing about it as much.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
