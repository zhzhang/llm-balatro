{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization: Mercury, Neptune, and the Final Boss**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my current thought process. I'm at Ante 8, Round 19, and the final boss fight is looming. My goal is to crush the final Blind. Right now I'm in the shop with $42 to play with. I'm packing some decent Jokers: Droll (Polychrome), Ramen (X2), The Tribe (X2 for Flush), Perkeo (Copies a consumable), and Stuntman (+250 chips). I also have Mercury (Level 2 Pair) and Neptune (Level 6 Straight Flush) consumables. Flush is at level 10, and Straight Flush is at level 6.\n\nMy core strategy hinges on Perkeo. I *really* want Perkeo to copy Neptune (for that Straight Flush boost) or a Jupiter (Flush level up) if I can find one in the shop. I have both Mercury and Neptune now, which means Perkeo has a 50/50 chance of being what I want. Selling Mercury ensures Perkeo gets the better card, Neptune.\n\nLet's do some quick math: If I play a Flush, which is (170 + 250) * (22 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 80,640. If I play a Straight Flush, it's (300 + 250) * (28 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 125,400. Even though Straight Flush is harder to hit, it's the clear winner if I can get there. Stuntman is a solid multiplier here.\n\nSo, the play is clear: Sell Mercury to guarantee Perkeo copies Neptune. I have $42. I can reroll for $3 to hunt for Jupiter (Flush level up) or better jokers/planets. I also see the Overstock Plus voucher ($7), which is a no-brainer to get more shop slots for future rerolls.\n\nThe order of operations is key: *before* I commit to the next round, I need to maximize this shop. Selling Mercury first is the key.\n\n1.  Sell Mercury.\n2.  Check the shop: Earth, Mad Joker. Useless.\n3.  Reroll? Worth it?\n4.  Buy the Overstock Plus voucher. More shop slots.\n\nIt is clear I'm going to sell the Mercury, and it looks like a `sell_consumable` action at position 1. Selling is the cleaner action to take before rerolling the shop for more value.\n\nI can make a `sell_consumable` call with the position of `1`. I can do it!\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
