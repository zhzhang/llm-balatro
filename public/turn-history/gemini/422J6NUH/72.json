{"reasoning":"**Strategic Blind Select Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase, specifically Ante 3, facing the boss blind. My goal is to hit 4000 chips. \"The Psychic\" requires five cards to be played. I've got a strong Flush strategy already in place. I have a Gros Michel, an Egg, a Droll Joker (Polychrome, Flush bonus), Perkeo (Legendary, clones consumables), and a Crafty Joker. My consumables are two \"The Moon\" cards, which convert three cards to Clubs. I also have $31.\n\nMy initial thought is to make a Flush. This looks solid, given my hand. Level 4 Flush (80 chips base), Crafty (+80 chips) and a solid mult boost from Gros Michel and Droll. Droll's Polychrome is great, and will multiply the flush. Perkeo has already cloned a \"The Moon\" at the shop, for later.\n\nCurrently, Droll is in position 3, providing +10 Mult, then x1.5 Multiplier. Since I don't have another xMult Joker, this is the ideal setup. I want the total Mult to be as high as possible.\n\nThe order is: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($), Droll (Polychrome, +10 Mult, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (clone), Crafty (+80 Chips).\n\nMy math suggests that I'll achieve well over the target of 4000 chips with a Flush. I have 195 Chips and 52.5 Mult, for an estimated 10,237 chips. This is more than sufficient.\n\nSince I am at the Blind Select screen, the correct action to proceed is `play_round`. There is no need to make any sales or adjustments. Let's do it.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
