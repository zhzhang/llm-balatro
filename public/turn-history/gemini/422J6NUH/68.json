{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment: Flush Build Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 3, Round 7. Flush build is the name of the game, and I'm looking to fine-tune it. I've got a solid foundation with Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and Crafty Joker. My consumables are The Moon (negative) and I have $55 to spend. The vouchers are \"Reroll Surplus\" and \"Clearance Sale,\" which are irrelevant right now.\n\nMy immediate focus is *scaling* and *deck fixing* because, frankly, the hand is good enough to win, but I'm looking to win BIG.\n\nRight now, the shop is showing Rocket and Devious Joker. Rocket's economy is tempting, but Egg is already doing pretty well, scaling at $3 per round, which, even though it's not a lot, still translates to a good deal of scaling. I also already have a full joker loadout, so Rocket would require a sale. No thanks. Devious is a no-go for this Flush-centric build.\n\nI want Jupiter. Or, barring that, a power tarot to feed to Perkeo's cloning. The Moon is decent for deck fixing, but another Planet card is the *real* prize.\n\nSince I have $55, I can afford to reroll. Let's see... a reroll costs $7, and I have five Joker slots and only one consumable slot (negative). That leaves plenty of room for error.\n\nI think the best play is to reroll the shop and keep an eye out for a planet card or a better consumable (like a tarot pack) for Perkeo to duplicate. The reroll keeps me above the interest threshold, which is good. Let's do it.\n\nWait, should I sell the Egg? No, the egg scales.\n\nAnd I won't use the moon (negative), because I have Perkeo. No point until I find another consumable to clone. I'm running the math: `Perkeo + Negative Consumable = Double Negative consumable`.\n\nAha! There are no Shop Boosters available. This means that I'm rerolling only the shop cards.\n\nGiven my money ($55), my build goals, and the shop offerings, the logical move is to reroll the shop for $7, leaving me with $48. Here we go.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
