{"reasoning":"**Final Boss Showdown: Optimization Time**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, final boss. Time to maximize this score! I've got $6, a solid Joker setup, and \"The Chariot\" ready to roll with a Steel card.  The goal is a massive Flush score to blow the boss away.\n\nI'm holding: The Tribe, Droll Joker, Ramen, Stuntman, and Brainstorm. Brainstorm is copying The Tribe. Flush is at Level 13 (215 Chips, 28 Mult). The Chariot is ready. \n\nLet's check the shop. Nothing jumps out as a game-changer. I briefly consider Strength and Sly Joker, and even a reroll, but with this setup, they aren't worth the money. Selling Judgement for an extra dollar for a reroll is tempting, but with my current hand levels and multipliers, it's not worth the risk.\n\nMy initial calculation is: 215 (chips) + 55 (cards) + 250 (Stuntman) = 520 chips.  Mult: (28 + 10 (Droll)) = 38. Then (2 * 2 * 2 * 1.5) = x12. Total Mult: 38 * 12 = 456. Total Score: 520 * 456 = 237,120. With The Chariot: 355,680. That's more than enough.\n\nNow, wait... should I reroll? I have $6. I can reroll once, and I have nothing great to buy. Maybe Jupiter? No. With $6 and a reroll cost of $5, let's just go.\n\nWait, the \"To Do List\" says I can earn $4 if I play a flush. In this case, it's not applicable. Let's start the boss.\n\nAnd now I need to optimize Joker placement.\n\nCurrently: Tribe, Droll, Ramen, Stuntman, Brainstorm.  Brainstorm copies Tribe (leftmost).  Let's check those multipliers.\n\nThe order of Jokers matters. Droll Joker gives +10 mult and x1.5 mult. Plus mults happen before x mults, usually.\n\nMy Calculation:\n28 mult (base).\nTribe: * 2.\nDroll: + 10. Then * 1.5.\nRamen: * 2.\nBrainstorm: * 2.\n\nNow, let's rearrange to check the output.\n\nIf Droll is at the very beginning and Brainstorm copies it: (28 + 10) * 1.5, then multiply.\n\nWith that:\n1.  Droll: (28+10) * 1.5 = 57.\n2.  Tribe: 57 * 2 = 114.\n3.  Ramen: 114 * 2 = 228.\n4.  Stuntman: ...\n5.  Brainstorm (Droll Copy): (228 + 10) * 1.5 = 357.\n\nAnd now my previous Tribe strategy:\n(28 * 2) -> (56 + 10) * 1.5, * 2 = 396.\n\nOh. I want to have the +10 happen before all the multipliers.\n\nIf I rearrange: Droll, Tribe, Ramen, Brainstorm = the same situation.\n\n**The most efficient strategy is Droll Joker first:**\nBase 28 mult.\nDroll Joker (+10, x1.5) = (28+10) * 1.5 = 57.\nThe Tribe (x2) = 114.\nRamen (x2) = 228.\nBrainstorm (copies Droll) = (228+10) * 1.5 = 357.\n\nIf Droll Joker is at the beginning, Brainstorm copies it:\n28 + 10 = 38 mult.\n38 * 1.5 = 57.\n57 * 2 = 114.\n114 * 2 = 228.\n(228 + 10) * 1.5 = 357.\n\n(Base + 10) * x1.5 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 456.\n\nThe best order is Droll first.\n\n**Final Joker Arrangement**:\n\n1.
