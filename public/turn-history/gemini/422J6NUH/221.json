{"reasoning":"Okay, here's the plan. We're at Ante 7, heading into the Shop phase. The Boss Blind, \"The Flint,\" is looming, which halves base chips and mult, so I need to prepare for that. I've got $78, which is good. Let's see, my current hand setup... I'm rocking a Flush build. Flush is level 8, Straight is level 5. My Jokers are Droll (the +mult, x1.5), Ramen (x2 mult), The Tribe (x2 mult), Perkeo (the Legendary duplicate), and Stuntman (+chips). I've got Saturn, a Straight level-up consumable. My goal here is to optimize for the Boss. The \"Perkeo Strategy\" is in play - I'll try to get Jupiter (a Flush level up) or another great consumable with the Perkeo duplicate.\n\nThe math for the boss is that I'll need a way to build big. The Flint's Halving effect is rough; my math says around 40k if I can make 1 flush. The Boss target is 70k. With my Stuntman (250 chips), the multipliers from Droll, Ramen, and Tribe, and my base Flush, I think two hands would work.\n\nNow, I see Luchador in the shop; it disables the boss. Is this a good purchase? I could sell a Joker to buy it... I'm thinking, is the extra Joker slot worth the risk of losing a critical Joker like Perkeo or Stuntman? Not worth it. I can beat the boss without it.\n\nPerkeo duplicates a random consumable at the end of the shop. I have Saturn, a Straight level up. I'd *much* rather have a Jupiter (Flush level up) or a great Tarot card to duplicate. Right now, I'm leaning toward getting better consumables to duplicate.\n\nI see Arcana Packs in the shop. Jumbo Arcana Pack ($4) and regular Arcana Pack ($3). Should I reroll instead? Reroll cost is $3, which is cheap. I've got the funds.\n\nRight, I've got $78. Okay, I'm going to buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack. I need to keep the logic for how Perkeo works straight: \"Creates a Negative copy... at the end of the shop.\" So I want Jupiter or a good Tarot. Can't hold a Jupiter for Perkeo if I find one - I use it, it's gone. To get Jupiter I need the Arcana Pack.\n\nOkay, should I just reroll? It might give me Jupiter or another good card. But let's check the Arcana pack first. Even if it doesn't give me the perfect card for Perkeo, it will give me some help.\n\nI will open that Arcana Pack now.\n\nIt's the Jumbo one, right? \"Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards to be used immediately.\" Correct. That's a \"buy\\_booster\" action.\n\nAction: `buy_booster 1`\n\nIs Saturn the best thing for Perkeo? No, but it's something. If I find nothing, I still have Saturn. If I find something good, it improves the deck. Then I can reroll for a better consumable.\n\nThe instruction for Perkeo: \"Creates a Negative copy of 1 random consumable card in your possession at the end of the shop.\" Right. I'm currently holding Saturn. I want Jupiter. Let's see what the pack holds.\n\nOkay, `buy_booster`, position: 1. Let's double-check.\n\nHold on, let me quickly double check the JSON schema. `action`: \"buy\\_booster\", `positions`: \\[1]. Right.\n\nCheck if I need anything else right now. Boss: The Flint. I'm scaling. Saturn doesn't help with Flushes. Jupiter would. Arcana pack is a good gamble.\n\nWait, I need to make a quick check of Supernova. It's in the Shop. If I buy Supernova, it adds +22 mult. If I replace Droll with Supernova I'll lose Droll's x1.5. If I replace Ramen, the bonus is lower. Supernova isn't an upgrade. I will go with the Arcana Pack.\n\nRight, `buy_booster 1`. Action: buy\\_booster, Position: 1.\n\nDoes buy\\_booster need anything else? No. Valid? Yes. Logical? Yes. Looking for a deck improvement.\n\nIs there any reason to swap out Saturn for a better card? No, Saturn is fine for now, and the negative version can be useful.\n\nOkay\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
