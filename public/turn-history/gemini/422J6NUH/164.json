{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy: Big Blind and Flush Focus**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 6, Round 14, and I'm on the Big Blind. I've got $67, which I just received thanks to the Garbage Tag. My goal is to either beat the Big Blind with 30,000 chips or skip for a Charm Tag, giving me a Mega Arcana Pack. Looking ahead, \"The Club\" is the upcoming boss, and that means my Club-centric strategy will be somewhat debuffed. So, I'll need to figure out what that means for my run.\n\nMy current hand consists of: Gros Michel (+15 Mult, chance to destroy a card), Egg (sell value of $40 and growing), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Polychrome Mult), Perkeo (makes a negative copy of a consumable), and Blue Joker (+94 Chips). The Moon (negative consumable) is key to this build, because it converts 3 cards to Clubs. I have two of them currently. I have two consumable slots free.\n\nSince I'm playing the Big Blind, I should be able to get a shop and trigger Perkeo again, while getting a chance to shop. This is much better than the skip. This means I want to ensure I get that Jupiter card, along with other Jokers.\n\nHere's the problem: The Boss debuffs Clubs. But, I am set up to make a powerful flush with the existing Jokers, and the debuff is just reducing the cards, not the multipliers. However, a shop gives me a higher chance of removing that risk. Also, if I get debuffed, the Blue Joker, Gros Michel, and Droll Joker are not debuffed.\n\nIf I play a Flush, I'm estimating about 200 chips in raw card value plus roughly 10500 chips per hand. The flush level is at 4 with 80 chips and 10 mult. With $67 I can buy a ton in a shop and easily get Jupiter cards.\n\nShould I skip? The Charm Tag gives me a Mega Arcana Pack, which is good for manipulation and planets, but a shop is more valuable. With the shop, I can easily reroll for better Jokers and a Jupiter card. Skipping is not the right choice.\n\nMy plan is to play the Big Blind. My action is `play_round`. I'm going to use one of the \"The Moon\" cards to keep a copy of the consumable in my hand. Then I will have Perkeo trigger in the shop. I will focus on Flushes.\n\nI want to estimate my hand's value. Per hand, I estimate 10,500 chips for a Flush. I have to play the round, so I will select:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 31500\n}\n```\n\nWait, the prompt asked for the total value of chips. So, I need to provide the estimate for my intended hand type of Flush. Since there are around 3 rounds to meet the threshold, I need to estimate the total.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
