{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Cosmic Currents: Pack Selection and Perkeo's Potential**\n\nAlright, final ante, round 19, and I'm staring down the Planet Pack after buying the Celestial Pack – time to make some calculated moves. I've got a healthy $47 in the bank, and my Joker lineup is looking pretty solid: Droll Joker for Flush boosts, Ramen for that sweet multiplier, The Tribe further amplifies Flushes, Perkeo ready to copy a consumable, and Stuntman for extra chips. My primary strategy is all about Flushes, currently at Level 10, so I'm laser-focused on that. The real question is how to get more use out of my Jokers and the available Planets.\n\nThe key is Perkeo. I need to make sure I *buy* a consumable *after* selecting my pack card to trigger its copy effect. I've got three choices in this pack: Pluto (High Card Level 3), Neptune (Straight Flush Level 5), and Saturn (Straight Level 5). Because this is a Celestial Pack, whatever I pick I use it immediately.\n\nSince I am focused on my Flush strategy, and my deck has 33/36 cards as Clubs, this means I need to think about which of these cards maximizes the benefits for my current strategy. I can buy Earth or Mercury from the shop. I can then use that and have Perkeo copy it.\n\nLet's break down the choices. High Card is the safest fallback but offers the least punch. Straights are not the plan right now, but Neptune's Straight Flush is a high-level boost (+40 chips, +4 mult), which is hard to pass up. The Straight is easier to achieve, but with so many Clubs, I'm statistically much more likely to stumble into a Straight Flush. It seems like Neptune, with its Straight Flush, is the most powerful choice, even if the odds are low. With 33 Clubs in the deck, Straight Flush may be more likely than a regular Straight.\n\nThe most logical sequence is: select Neptune, exit the pack selection, buy a consumable planet (Earth or Mercury), and hold it for Perkeo to duplicate. The prompt is asking for a JSON object with `action` and `positions`.\n\nAfter carefully examining the deck's card ranks, I can see the ranks are well-distributed. Straight Flush may be more viable. I can't just pick something blindly; I need to act.\n\nSo, I'm going with **`{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2]}`**.\nI need to keep in mind, I need to buy a card in the shop after.\n\nUltimately, I'm aiming for Neptune because the potential stats are worth it. I do not have a specific hand type in mind right now; this selection should not trigger any chips calculation.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
