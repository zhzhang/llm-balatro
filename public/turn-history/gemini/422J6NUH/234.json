{"reasoning":"**Finalizing the Plan for \"The Flint\"**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. We're in Ante 7, facing \"The Flint,\" which halves our base chip and mult values. My immediate focus is on ensuring a strong Flush build. We have a solid foundation with a Level 8 Flush (140 chips, 18 mult), Droll Joker (Polychrome, +10 mult, x1.5 mult on Flush), Ramen (x2 mult), The Tribe (x2 mult on Flush), Perkeo (Legendary, clones a consumable), and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size). We also have Jupiter (Lvl 8 Flush).\n\nThe critical play is to use Perkeo to clone the Jupiter. Given the current hand, the primary goal now is the Boss Blind. The Flush build is the strategy, and Perkeo cloning Jupiter is the top priority.\n\nI could reroll the shop, chasing another consumable. But I've already rerolled a few times, and the chances are low. Plus, another consumable dilutes the Perkeo pool. The shop has nothing of value. I need to trigger Perkeo to get the negative Jupiter and then move on.\n\nNow, let's look at the numbers. \"The Flint\" halves our base values, so Flush becomes 70 chips, 9 mult. Stuntman boosts the chips by +250, so that is 320 chips, I will consider the flush. Droll adds +10 base mult, so total base mult is 19.\n\nThe X mults: 1.5 (Droll) * 2 (Ramen) * 2 (Tribe) = 6x multiplier.\nTotal Mult: 19 * 6 = 114.\nTotal Score: 320 * 114 = 36,480.\nIf the Boss Blind Threshold is 110,000, I need roughly 3 flushes.\n\nLet's look at a scenario with two Jupiters. We would be at:\nLvl 9 Flush: 77.5 chips, 10 mult.\nTotal chips = 327.5.\nTotal mult = (10 + 10) * 6 = 120.\nScore: 39,300.\nGetting more Jupiters is the way.\n\nInterest is capped at $25. Reroll cost is $9, which is affordable, but I've already rerolled. The current plan of triggering Perkeo is more valuable.\nIf I go to Round Select, Perkeo will clone Jupiter. Then I can use the new negative copy at the beginning of the next shop.\n\nI'm checking the reroll cost again. $9. Should I? No, the best play is to end the shop and move on.\n\nAfter checking the boosters and vouchers, there are none, so now I will proceed to the round select to ensure that Perkeo triggers.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. The plan is to get to 42,180.\nWith 4 hands (4 * 42,180 = 168k). This should be enough to take down \"The Flint.\"\nThe cost is 36k per hand, it's doable.\nI could reroll and chase a Jupiter, but at this point, Perkeo is the more consistent play.\n\nLet's check the Jokers again, Droll, Ramen, Tribe, Perkeo, and Stuntman.\nThe order of operations is: Chips, then Mult, and lastly xMult.\n\nWe are ready.\n\nNow the final decision: round\\_select.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
