{"reasoning":"**My Flush Build Optimization - Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, Round 7 and staring down a shop. I've got $48 and my primary focus is maximizing my Flush score. Currently, I have a solid Flush Level 4 (80 Chips, 10 Mult) and a hand full of Jokers: Gros Michel (+15 Mult, with a chance to break), Egg (Scaling sell value), Droll Joker (Polychrome, +10 Mult on Flush, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (Legendary, clones 1 consumable), and Crafty Joker (+80 Chips on Flush). I'm at max Joker capacity, so every purchase has to be strategic. The only consumable I have is \"The Moon\" (Negative edition), which isn't taking up a slot.\n\nThe shop offers the Mad Joker (Two Pair, +10 mult) and the Earth (Full House planet), neither of which are relevant to my Flush strategy. I really need something that Perkeo can clone to boost my deck. \"The Moon\" is already in my inventory. It's great for fixing my hand to all Clubs, which is perfect for Flushes, but I'm thinking I can do better. Jupiter (Flush Level) would be ideal, or a useful Tarot card like The Star, The Moon, Strength or Death for deck improvement.\n\nI can afford a few rerolls. Interest is a non-issue at my current cash, so I will prioritize finding something better. I'm going to *reroll_shop* as many times as it takes (keeping in mind the current cost is $8) to find a high-impact consumable. Even though Earth is only $2 to buy it, it does not fit my overall build and I shouldn't waste money when I can easily reroll. I'm aiming for Jupiter or a powerful Tarot card to clone and amplify my Flush output.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
