{"reasoning":"**Decisions, Decisions... Balatro Ante 5, Round 12**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Big Blind is coming up, and I need to solidify my plan. I've got $39, interest maxes at $25, so I can afford to play around with rerolls. Let's see...\n\nI've got a decent hand, currently leaning into a Flush build. Let's quickly re-evaluate:\n\n*   **Jokers:** Gros Michel (+15 Mult, a bit risky), Egg (growing value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Mult - Polychrome!), Perkeo (essential for copying \"The Moon\" tarot), and Blue Joker (+94 Chips). The joker order is currently good: Flat Mult boosters (Gros Michel), then a useful x1.5 from Droll.\n*   **Consumable:** \"The Moon\" (Negative). This is what Perkeo will copy. It turns cards into Clubs, super helpful for Flushes. No slot concerns because copies are also negative.\n\nI'm definitely keeping these jokers. I'm going to reroll. I'm fishing for better Jokers (Jupiter to level up Flushes, other good Mult or Chip providers). I'm also looking for useful Tarots.\n\nThe current shop is: Mars (useless), Joker (+4 Mult, weak), Crafty Joker (+80 Chips, worse than Blue Joker). No!\n\nOkay, time to reroll.\n\nI've got plenty of money, and I need to maximize my chances. I'm not selling Egg yet. It might be useful, but not when the shop is this weak.\n\nMy current Joker order:\n1: Gros Michel\n2: Egg\n3: Droll Joker\n4: Perkeo\n5: Blue Joker\n\nLet's do some quick score calculations.\nFor a Flush, the hand will score about:\nChips: 80 (base) + 94 (Blue Joker) + ~40 from cards = ~214 chips.\nMult: 10 (base) + 15 (Gros Michel) + 10 (Droll) = ~35 Mult.\nThen apply Droll's x1.5 mult = ~52.5 Mult.\nTotal = 214 * 52.5 = 11,235.\nFor Ante 5, Big Blind usually requires ~15,000 - 20,000. It's likely I'll need two hands.\n\nI've got $39. I'm going to reroll the shop.\nThe cost is $3. I now have $36. Still above the interest threshold.\nReroll!\n\nI will check the card order after the reroll.\n\nDo I need to rearrange Jokers? Let's quickly re-check.\n1: Gros Michel (+15 Mult)\n2: Egg\n3: Droll Joker (+10 Mult, x1.5 Mult)\nCalculation: (Base + 15 + 10) * 1.5. This is correct.\nWait, Blue Joker gives Chips. Chips are added together then multiplied by total Mult. Order of Chip-giving jokers doesn't matter unless there are xChips (which don't exist in base game except for specific mods or very rare circumstances).\nThe joker order is correct.\n\nI will reroll.\nCost is $3. Money $39 -> $36. Still above $25 interest threshold.\n\nMy action: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
