{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision Making**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, round 13, shop step. I've got $32, and my jokers are solid: Gros Michel for the flat mult, Egg for the sell value, Droll for the Flush multiplier, Perkeo which is key, and Blue Joker for the chip boost. I'm flush-focused (clubs, level 4), and my current consumables are The Moon (negative club conversion), Mars (4 of a kind level 1) and Venus (3 of a kind level 3).\n\nThe goal is to move past Ante 5. The deck strategy is centered on Flushes. I need to think about Perkeo's utility – it creates a *negative* copy of a consumable. To get the most out of Perkeo, I need to focus on which consumables I want duplicated. The Moon is the priority, since it's the core of my club strategy. Mars and Venus, are for hands I'm not focusing on.\n\nI need to decide what to do about Mars and Venus. I don't need them and the space is needed for more consumables. The shop has Superposition, Green Joker, Mr. Bones, and a Celestial Pack. I'm leaning toward the Celestial Pack for Jupiter (which is a Flush level) and other planet cards I might be able to use immediately. It might also have something I could sell. I don't really *need* the Green Joker or Mr. Bones.\n\nSince Perkeo makes a negative copy, and negative consumables don't take up space, The Moon is the only one I want copied. I can use/sell Mars and Venus before the end of the shop to maximize Perkeo's efficiency and ensure it targets The Moon.\n\nMy max consumable slots are 3 (2 base + 1 Perkeo). I currently have 3 consumables. I can't hold another non-negative consumable.\n\nSo, here's the plan: First, I will buy the Celestial Pack to open up my options. Then, I can look at the planets in the pack and see if I need to sell/use Mars and Venus to make room.\n\nI have enough money, so I'll buy the Celestial Pack first. I've double checked the schema; I'm good on that front.\n\nSo, the action is: `buy_booster`, position: 1. Now, let's see what the pack brings.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
