{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop in Ante 7**\n\nOkay, here we are in Ante 7, Round 16, with $94 in the bank. Shop phase. My hand is looking pretty solid for a Flush strategy. I've got Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Stuntman, and Perkeo as Jokers, and Jupiter as my consumable. Perkeo's going to create a negative copy of a consumable at the end of the shop. Since I have only Jupiter, I will copy it. I want to max out my score potential this round.\n\nThe shop itself offers some interesting choices. The Devil Tarot is there, and I could buy that. The Golden Ticket is tempting, but my slots are full, so it's irrelevant. Then there are two boosters: an Arcana Pack and a Spectral Pack, as well as the Wasteful voucher. I like the Spectral Pack because it has the potential for game-changing effects like Ankh, Hex, or Aura cards. The Arcana Pack would be good for deck manipulation, and Wasteful is also very useful for the free discard.\n\nI should prioritize the Spectral Pack. It only costs $3, thanks to the Clearance Sale voucher. I have to think about how to prioritize my purchases. Since I only have one consumable, Perkeo is guaranteed to copy Jupiter. So, I don't want to buy The Devil because I only want a negative Jupiter.\n\nI'm thinking I'll buy the Spectral Pack first. It's usually a high-value pick. Then I'll re-evaluate the Arcana Pack or the Wasteful Voucher. Now that my mind is clear, I think I'll select the Spectral Pack in the shop. After that, I will need to call `round_select` to trigger Perkeo.\n\nTherefore, `buy_booster` at position 2 (Spectral Pack). No, wait a minute... Let me re-evaluate the offers here. Stuntman is already bought. Golden Ticket is irrelevant. I only have one consumable. The Devil is out because Perkeo will copy Jupiter.\n\nOkay, back to the booster selection. Position 2 (Spectral Pack) is still the play here. **Action: `buy_booster`, position 2.**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
