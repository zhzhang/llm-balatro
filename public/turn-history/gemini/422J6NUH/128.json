{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current Balatro State**\n\nOkay, so the game wants me to make a move. Let's see... Ante 5, Round 12, Big Blind is next. I've got $42, which is good. I need to get ready for the Big Blind, so the immediate goal is to select the cards.\n\nMy Jokers are: Gros Michel, Egg (which I don't want to sell now), Droll Joker (Flush + Mult), Perkeo (consumable copier!), and Blue Joker. I have \"The Moon\" which turns cards into Clubs. This is good for my Flush strategy. And I have vouchers: Overstock, Clearance Sale, Reroll Surplus.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best use of my cash. I can comfortably spend down to $25 without losing any interest. Perkeo is a huge factor here. At the end of the shop, it will copy a consumable. The \"Moon\" is my best consumable right now. I definitely want to keep it.\n\nI'm looking at the shop: Mars is useless. The basic Joker is too weak. Crafty Joker is weaker than my Blue Joker, and definitely not worth the price. That leaves the Standard Pack, which is $3. It's a cheap shot to see if I can get a playable card, like a King or Ace of Clubs, or a Red Seal card, or something else helpful.\n\nSince I am focused on building a Flush strategy, this is the action for me. Before the round, I should consider the Standard Pack. I should also check if rerolling is a good strategy.\n\nLooking back, the previous shop was bad (128). I skipped the Buffoon Pack.\n\nAction Options:\n1.  Buy Standard Pack.\n2.  Reroll ($3)\n3.  Round Select.\n\nRerolling would be an option, but before spending money, let me check the Standard Pack.\n\nHere's my logic:\n*   I have \"The Moon\" (Negative).\n*   Perkeo copies at the END of the shop.\n*   \"The Moon\" is useless in the shop, but it is great for getting clubs.\n*   Let's buy that Standard Pack!\n\nThe Egg is generating $3 per round, so I don't need to sell it yet. No to the Crafty Joker, and no to the basic Joker. No to Mars.\n\nStandard Pack it is.\n\nOne more thing: I should arrange my Jokers for maximum efficiency.\nDroll Joker is \"+10 Mult on Flush, x1.5 Polychrome\".\nMy order matters. I want the flat +Mult to come before the xMult.\nI have Gros Michel (+15 Mult).\nThe correct order is Gros Michel -> Egg -> Droll Joker -> Perkeo -> Blue Joker.\nI need to put Droll Joker last, so that his Mult applies to all previous Jokers.\nIf I have a Flush:\nBase + Gros Michel (+15) + Droll (+10) \\* Polychrome (1.5).\nSo, I want: (Base Mult + 15 + 10) \\* 1.5.\n\nMy current order is:\n1: Gros Michel\n2: Egg\n3: Droll Joker\nThis is optimal.\n\nSo, I'm buying the pack. Let me double-check... Yes, it's correct.\n\nOkay, let's go! I'm buying the Standard Pack. Command: `buy_booster`. Positions: `[1]`.\n\nThe Perkeo copy will happen after I select the round. \"The Moon\" is useless in the shop. I should definitely save it for the round.\n\nFinal action: `buy_booster`. Positions: `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
