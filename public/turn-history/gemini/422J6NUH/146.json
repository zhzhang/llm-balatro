{"reasoning":"**Round 13 Shop Strategy: Perkeo Cloning Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 5, Round 13, and sitting on $29. My immediate goal is to maximize scoring this round and set myself up for the next. The strategy is clear: I'm building towards Flushes, specifically Clubs.\n\nLooking at my Jokers, I've got a solid foundation: Gros Michel for the base multiplier, Egg for some sell-value, a Droll Joker to beef up Flush multipliers, Perkeo which is Legendary (always good), and a Blue Joker for chip generation based on my deck size. I also have \"The Moon\" (a negative consumable that converts cards to Clubs), and \"Venus\" which levels up a Three of a Kind.\n\nMy primary concern right now is Perkeo. It clones a random consumable at the end of the shop, and I *need* it to clone \"The Moon\" to keep fueling my Flush strategy. To guarantee this, I must get rid of \"Venus\" before the shop closes.\n\nI could sell \"Venus\", but using it seems like the smarter move. It levels up Three of a Kind, which offers a decent backup scoring option if the Flushes don't cooperate.\n\nI've also assessed the other cards on offer: Superposition is useless in this build. Green Joker requires hands and no discards, and right now is at +0, so I will pass. Mr. Bones offers insurance, but I feel comfortable with my current score. Reroll is tempting, could find a better Joker or planet, but getting rid of Venus is more important for Perkeo's trigger.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to *use* \"Venus\".\n\nSo, that's it. Execute action `use_consumable` at position 2 (Venus), to clear it out of my inventory.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [\n    2\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
