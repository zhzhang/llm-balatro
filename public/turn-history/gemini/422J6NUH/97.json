{"reasoning":"**Strategic Blind Assault: The Big Challenge**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 4, Boss Blind: \"The Big,\" and a 20,000 chip target. Money's tight at $33, but the hand is strong, and with the Boss Blind, the only option is to play, and a *strong* play is required.\n\nI've got a killer Joker lineup: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg (for later, if needed), Droll Joker (+10 Mult if Flush, x1.5 Mult, Polychrome x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (Legendary, negative consumables), and Blue Joker (+92 Chips). The setup is built for a Flush strategy. I also have three negative \"The Moon\" consumables - no need to play those yet. Selling isn't necessary with negative consumables.\n\nMy immediate focus is on hitting that 20,000 chip target. My target is a Level 4 Flush (80 chips, 10 mult base). Blue Joker adds 92 chips per hand. Gros Michel adds 15 mult, and Droll Joker adds 10 mult and the multiplicative factors. With a basic calculation: (80 + 92) for chips, and (10 + 15 + 10) for mult. The Droll Joker adds x1.5 from both primary and secondary mult. Therefore, with two Flushes, I should easily clear the Blind.\n\nThe most important step is ensuring my Jokers are ordered correctly. Gros Michel at position 1 applies +15 mult. Droll Joker is at position 3, providing +10 mult and x1.5 multiplier. This works because Balatro applies additive mults before multiplicative mults.\n\nSo, the play is simple: `play_round`. Nothing else needs adjusting. The game is the round. All the pieces are in place. The round starts and it is time to play! The hand is `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
