{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop: Prioritizing Perkeo and Long-Term Potential**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 3, Round 5, just finished the Ante 2 boss. I have $14. The priority is Perkeo, the Legendary Joker that creates a negative copy of a consumable. To get it going, I *must* have a consumable in my inventory at the end of the shop. I'm looking at an Arcana Pack for $3. With Clearance Sale, that's the best bet right now. I have 5/5 Joker slots.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I get a consumable. I have no consumables, and the Arcana Pack has the best chance to get me one. I could also buy the Buffoon Pack for a Joker, but Perkeo is paramount. If I grab the Arcana Pack, I can see what I get. If it gives me a Tarot card I can hold (Emperor, Fool, etc.), great. That goes into the inventory, and Perkeo is ready to go. If it's a \"use immediately\" Tarot, I'll use it, but I still need *one* consumable to *have* at the end of the shop.\n\nI have some good Jokers already: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($13 sale, +$3/round), Droll Joker (+10 Mult on Flush, Polychrome x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (again, Legendary), and Delayed Gratification ($2 per unused discard at end of round). I need to sell the pack, because I also need to make sure I have the cards in order of importance.\n\nThere's a Crazy Joker in the shop for $3 (+12 Mult on Straights), and Erosion for $4 (+4 Mult for cards below 52). No, I don't need Crazy Joker because my slots are full. Erosion is bad until later. The shop also offers a Reroll Surplus Voucher ($7), but that's not the priority. I need to get Perkeo going.\n\nI'm thinking of rearranging Jokers. Droll Joker, with Polychrome, should be at the end of the additive sequence, after the other multipliers. My order now is Gros Michel (+15), Egg, Droll (x1.5), Perkeo, and Delayed Gratification. The order is fine.\n\nThe only real play is that Arcana Pack. It's the cheapest way to make the Perkeo strategy.\n\nSo, the plan is locked: Buy Arcana Pack. No, wait. Is there any reason to *sell* anything? Egg is good for scaling, Gros Michel is a key scorer. Delayed Gratification, while not a quick buck, is valuable for future rounds. The sale price is $3. I check the price. Yup, $3 for the pack. I'm good. I'm going to commit.\n\nFinal action: `buy_booster 1` (Arcana Pack).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
