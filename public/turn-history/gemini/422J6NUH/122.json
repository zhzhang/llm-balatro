{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Blind Select - Round 11**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 5, Round 11, and we're in BLIND\\_SELECT. The Small Blind is 11,000 chips. I have a solid setup, but let's make sure I play this optimally.\n\nFirst, the Jokers: Gros Michel is my primary multiplier (+15), Egg is just sitting there with a $31 sell value and scaling, Droll Joker adds another multiplier (+10 to Flushes, x1.5 Polychrome), Perkeo duplicates consumables, and Blue Joker is a straight chip boost (+92). I also have two \"The Moon\" cards (negative, so they don't take up any slots) thanks to Perkeo.\n\nMy immediate goal is clear: maximize the score and continue building my power. Perkeo just gave me a second \"The Moon\" after the shop. I need to keep \"The Moon\" in my inventory to use Perkeo effectively each round. That's crucial. I'm flush-focused. Droll Joker loves Flushes and I'm club-heavy because of The Moon.\n\nRight now, a Flush yields (80 + 92) chips = 172 base chips. My multipliers are (10 + 15 + 10) * 1.5 = 35 * 1.5 = 52.5. Total score is 172 * 52.5 = 9030. I need to hit 11,000 for the Small Blind. I can hit that in two hands.\n\nSo, do I play or skip the Small Blind? Playing gives me $3 + Interest + Hands remaining. Most importantly, it opens the shop, and Perkeo will trigger again *after* the shop. Skipping the blind gives me a Boss Tag, which would reroll the boss, \"The Mark.\" The Mark isn't that scary because I'm Flush-based, but that boss is annoying if I'm short on cards of the same suit. The tag is likely a waste. More money and more Perkeo duplicates are more valuable.\n\nWait a second… Perkeo triggers *after* the shop. That’s even more reason to *not* skip! More shops means more Perkeo triggers. I want those shops. No question about it.\n\nSo, `play_round` is the play. `skip_round` is out. I shouldn't use \"The Moon\" yet. It's meant to *convert* cards to clubs during a round. Now isn't the time. And using the Moon on no cards wouldn't make sense.\n\nLet's quickly check the Joker order. Blue Joker adds chips, then Gros Michel (mult), then Droll Joker (mult, x1.5). The current order is fine.\n\nI have 2 \"The Moon\" cards. Two consumable slots are open. Good.\n\nI'm ready: Action: `play_round`. Positions: null. Intended Hand Type: null.\n\nOkay, remembering the previous hands: Pairs were ~1836. Flushes were ~10,000. Small Blind is 11,000. I can nail this. The Boss Tag (skip reward) is weak compared to a Shop visit with Perkeo. No brainer.\n\nShould I sell Egg or Gros Michel? No. I don't need the money right now. Egg keeps growing. Gros Michel is my main mult source. Don't sell it!\n\nFinal Result: `play_round`. Let's get to the shop!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
