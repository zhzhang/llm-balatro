{"reasoning":"**Analysis of the Current Hand**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 19, Boss The Flint, which means halved base chips and mult. I'm in the SELECTING\\_HAND stage. My goal is 70,000 chips, and I'm currently at 63,441, needing 6,559 more. Three hands left, five discards.\n\nLet's look at the Jokers. Droll Joker gives +10 mult if Flush and X1.5 Polychrome. Ramen is straight X2 Mult. The Tribe is X2 mult if Flush. Perkeo is irrelevant right now. Stuntman gives +250 Chips, -2 hand size.\n\nMy hand: 8C, 7C, 5C, 5C, 5C, 2C (Steel, X1.5 Mult in hand), all clubs. So, it's a Flush. The 2C is the Steel card.\n\nCalculating... Base Flush (Level 10) is 85 chips and 11 mult (halved). Played chips are 8+7+5+5+5 = 30. Stuntman's 250 chips. Total chips: 85 + 30 + 250 = 365. Base Mult is 11. The Steel card gives 11 * 1.5 = 16.5. Droll gives 16.5 + 10 = 26.5. Droll's X1.5 gives 26.5 * 1.5 = 39.75. Ramen makes it 39.75 * 2 = 79.5. The Tribe gives 79.5 * 2 = 159. So, estimated score is 365 * 159 = 58,035.\n\nHang on. I got 63,441 last hand. Let's see if that math checks out. Last hand was Ace (11), Ace (11, Red Seal), Ace (11), King (10), 10 (10). Played chips then: 11 + 11*2 + 11 + 10 + 10 = 64. Total chips then: 85 + 64 + 250 = 399. Mult calc: (11 * 1.5 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 159. Thus 399 * 159 = 63,441. Perfectly matching.\n\nSo, for this hand, my new total chips are 365 (as calculated above, 85 base + 30 played + 250 Stuntman), and mult stays at 159. Score should be 365 * 159 = 58,035.\n\nI only need 6,559 more chips. 58,035 is way more than enough!\n\nMy play is 8C, 7C, 5C, 5C, 5C (indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). I'm keeping the 2C (index 6) for the Steel Mult. Hand type is Flush. Estimated chips: 58,035. No other hand is better with my jokers active. Discarding will only decrease the mult and lose the Steel X1.5 mult.\n\nWait, the previous turn had a Red Seal Ace of Clubs in position 2. This hand has a 7 of Clubs in position 2. No matter, the clubs all count for the flush.\n\nI will play indices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nEstimated Chips Logic:\nPrevious hand (Flush): 63,441.\nDifference in chips: Previous chips (played) = 64. Current chips (played) = 30.\nScore = (Base_Chips/2 + Played_Chips + Stuntman) * ((Base_Mult/2 * Steel_Mult + Droll_Add) * Droll_X * Ramen_X * Tribe_X)\nScore = (85 + 30 + 250) * ((11 * 1.5 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2)\nScore = 365 * 159 = 58,035.\n\nHere's the final JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
