{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop - Ante 7, Round 16**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 7, and the goal is, as always, to survive the upcoming rounds. I have $99, which is decent, but I need to make some smart purchases. My current strategy is flush-focused, given my Jokers: Droll (mult), Ramen (mult, but loses it on discard), The Tribe (flush mult), and Perkeo (copies consumables). I also have Jupiter, which is a key piece for leveling up my Flushes.\n\nI just sold Blue Joker to make room, and now I have a really strong option in the shop: Stuntman for $5. It gives +250 chips, but at the cost of a -2 hand size. Now, usually, that hand size reduction would be a real problem. But with my flush strategy, and how many clubs I've been getting, I can still find the cards I need in a six-card hand. I sold a +94 chip joker, so this is a great upgrade. I need to get it immediately.\n\nThe decision is clear: Stuntman is a better long-term choice than the other shop items. I just need to make sure I have enough money, which I do, and that there's room in my Joker slots (4/5), which there is.\n\nSo, I'm going to buy Stuntman now. Then I'll check what else is available and see if I should get any more Jokers or Consumables.\n\nI see that Perkeo is going to copy a consumable, and I already have Jupiter. The copy will be useful.\n\nI need to confirm the buy action in the code, `buy_card` and ensure I specify position 2 for Stuntman. The schema looks right and I have to act to ensure the Joker doesn't go away.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
