{"reasoning":"**Flush It Out!**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 7, Round 17. Small blind's up, I'm at zero chips and need 35,000 to clear. Got four hands left, and five discards.\n\nLet's see what we're working with. I've got a decent Joker lineup: Droll Joker (Flush Multiplier +10 and Polychrome x1.5), Ramen (x2 Mult, -0.01 per discard), The Tribe (x2 Mult for Flush), Perkeo (negative consumable end of shop), and Stuntman (+250 chips, but hurts with -2 hand size). And the Jupiter, level 6 flush gives +2 Mult and +15 chips.\n\nThe hand, it looks promising. A 10 of Spades is the gold card and gives a small value if I keep it. My other cards are all Clubs: Ace, King, Queen, and two Jacks. Bingo! That's a Flush right there.\n\nSo, the plan: play the Flush, of course, giving 110 base chips and a 14x multiplier. That's 51 chips from the card values. The Stuntman bumps me up another 250 chips. That's a total of 411 chips. Now for the multipliers, which look amazing:\n\n*   Droll Joker kicks in, boosting the Flush Multiplier by 10, bringing the Multi to 24.\n*   Then the Polychrome, so the Multi is 36.\n*   Ramen, a x2 Multi makes the Multi 72.\n*   The Tribe (another x2 for a Flush) brings us to 144.\n\nSo, 411 chips multiplied by 144. That's 59,184 chips! I need 35,000, so I'm set!\n\nI've got a hand size of 6 with Stuntman, but keeping the 10 of Spades. So it's a flush of clubs for the win!\n\nAction: play positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nHand type: Flush\nChips: 59,184. Done!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
