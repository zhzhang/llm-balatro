{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Analysis and Strategy**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 5, transitioning from the Boss of Ante 4, and it's the SHOP phase. I've got $47, which isn't bad at all. Let's see what we're working with.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup: Gros Michel for mult, Egg for a quick $31 if I sell it, Droll Joker for Flush mult and polychrome scaling, Perkeo for consumable duplication, and Blue Joker for some solid chip generation. My hand is focusing on Flush and it's already Level 4, so I'm in a good spot there. Notably, I've got \"The Moon\" negative consumable that turns cards into Clubs, perfect for maintaining that Flush strategy. I also have Reroll Surplus and Clearance Sale vouchers available. I have a full Joker slot, so I'll need to sell one if I find a better one.\n\nHere are the items in the shop: Banner and Red Card (both discounted), a Jumbo Buffoon Pack, a Jumbo Arcana Pack, and Overstock voucher.\n\nPerkeo is *key* here because it will copy \"The Moon\". I want to grab Overstock first, as it's a permanent shop improvement. Then I'll grab the Arcana pack for deck manipulation or permanent buffs, and finally the Buffoon Pack, hoping for a better Joker. I could sell the Egg for immediate cash, but I don't need it right now.\n\nThe plan is to buy Overstock first, and then spend $40 on the next things I want from the shop. I should double check what I have. Overstock will cost $7. Money is currently $47, but will be $40.\n\nCurrently, my Joker order seems optimal for how they work together, so I shouldn't need to shuffle them.\n\nAlright, so the action is `buy_voucher` for Overstock. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
