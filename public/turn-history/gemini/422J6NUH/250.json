{"reasoning":"**My Play: Ante 8, Round 19 – Blind Select**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in Ante 8, Blind Select. The goal is the Ante 8 Boss, requiring 100,000 chips. The current blind is Small Blind at 50,000, and the Big Blind is at 75,000.  My inventory is looking solid, but I need to optimize.\n\nI've got a strong hand: Flush at Level 10 and Straight Flush at Level 6, which are decent but can be improved. My Jokers are Droll Joker (Polychrome, +10 Mult, X1.5 on Flush), Ramen (X2 Mult), The Tribe (X2 on Flush), Perkeo (Duplicate consumable), and Stuntman (+250 chips, -2 hand size). Money isn't a huge issue, sitting at $33.\n\nPerkeo just triggered in the shop, creating a Negative Neptune, and I have two Neptunes, which is perfect for leveling Straight Flush. Now, I have a chance to get Straight Flush to Level 8.\n\nHere's the plan: I can easily clear the blinds with a single Straight Flush.\n\nNow, I need to choose an action.  The strategy is clear: I need to use the two Neptunes to level up my Straight Flush *before* I even think about playing a hand.  This will maximize my score in this round and any subsequent rounds. I should use them now, as the current hand is a Straight Flush. This is the optimal time to use the consumables, as Perkeo duplicates after the shop phase and this round will take me to the shop phase.\n\nThe most immediate and beneficial step is to improve the deck.\n\nThe logical order is:\n1. Use the Neptune consumable, to level up the Straight Flush to Level 7\n2. Use the Negative Neptune consumable, to level up the Straight Flush to Level 8.\n\nThe actions should be: `use_consumable` position 1 (Neptune) and `use_consumable` position 2 (Negative Neptune).\nThere's no reason to skip, as playing the round gives more money, though the focus now is to boost the hand. I should also rearrange the Jokers for optimal scoring. Droll first for its additive mult and then multiplicative mult.\n\nBefore I commit, let me double-check. The first Neptune doesn't require a target. Now, I'm ready to proceed.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
