{"reasoning":"**My Turn in Ante 8, Round 20**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 8, with the Big Blind and Boss Blind looming. I've got $41. My Joker setup is pretty solid: Droll Joker for the Flush boost, Ramen for the discard multiplier, The Tribe for Flush multiplier, Perkeo for consumable duplication, and Stuntman for chips. My Flush is already at Level 11, with decent chips and multiplier. I have a full Joker inventory and zero consumables, which is a key bottleneck right now.\n\nMy immediate goal is to maximize points for the upcoming blinds. But I also have Perkeo to consider. I *need* a consumable to make it work, and I have none.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see Saturn (Straight), Clever Joker (Chips for Two Pair, useless), Venus (Three of a Kind), Crafty Joker (Chips for Flush, inferior to Stuntman), and a Celestial Pack. I'm thinking about how to get the most out of Perkeo...\n\nThe Celestial Pack is tempting. It *could* give me a Jupiter (Flush) or Neptune (Straight Flush), and it *is* a \"level up immediately\", but I can't hold it for Perkeo.\n\nBuying Saturn or Venus, on the other hand, means I can *hold* them in the consumable slot. That's a guaranteed duplicate every round for free hand levels. Buying Crafty Joker is pointless given Stuntman. Selling Stuntman for Crafty is a downgrade.\n\nMy options boil down to: 1) Buy Saturn or Venus for the Perkeo synergy, 2) Buy the Celestial Pack anyway, hoping for a great card, or 3) Reroll the shop for a better consumable, specifically a held card or a Tarot card.\n\nGiven Perkeo's negative copy, I'd *love* a Jupiter so that I can level up my Flush, however, if I have to, I could settle for Saturn or Venus.\n\nI've got $41, and rerolling costs $3.\n\nAlright, the best move is to buy the Celestial Pack first.\n\nWait, I just bought a Celestial Pack on Turn 255/256 and there is only 1 left. Okay, so `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
