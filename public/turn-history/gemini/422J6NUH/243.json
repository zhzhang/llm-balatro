{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Perkeo Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, shop phase, $47 in the bank. Flush build, so I'm aiming for high Flush multipliers. I've got a decent Joker setup: Droll Joker for a general boost, Ramen for scaling, The Tribe for Flush synergy, Perkeo (the tricky Legendary), and Stuntman for chips. No consumables right now, which is the immediate issue. I have a few useful vouchers: Reroll Surplus, Blank, Clearance Sale, Overstock, and Wasteful.\n\nThe shop offers Earth ($2), Mad Joker ($3), Mercury ($2), an Arcana Pack ($3), and the Overstock Plus voucher ($7). The Overstock Plus voucher is tempting for future shops, but not essential right now. The Reroll cost is $3. My primary goal is to leverage Perkeo. Perkeo gives me a negative copy of a consumable *at the end of the shop*. Crucially, I have *no* consumables to copy. Therefore, I need to *buy* a consumable and *not* use it.\n\nGiven that my primary goal is getting a consumable to duplicate, the smart move is to buy a shop card immediately, I have to find a card that helps my Flush. Buying Mercury or Earth is the guaranteed method to trigger Perkeo. While Earth (Full House) or Mercury (Pair) are not ideal, any consumable is better than no consumable. I could also reroll for Jupiter (Flush), but the shop is probably not great to have many more options. The best path is the guaranteed path.\n\nSo, the first thought is to buy either Earth or Mercury (both are cheap). I previously decided that Mercury is slightly better as a fallback if I can't hit Flushes.\n\nHowever, I should be looking at the Arcana Pack first. The pack cards are used immediately. So the shop cards (Earth, Mad Joker, Mercury) are the only way to get a card to hold for Perkeo without rerolling.\n\nThe plan is this: buy a planet for Perkeo. Buying a planet will lock in the Perkeo consumable duplication. Reroll might provide me with something better, but this will work. And if the Reroll is not favorable, it is better than no duplication. Mercury costs $2, so it's a cheap insurance policy.\n\nI need the `buy_card` action, with position 3 (Mercury) to secure my consumable copy. I am going to buy the Mercury.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [3]"}
