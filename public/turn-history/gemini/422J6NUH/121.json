{"reasoning":"**Prioritizing Perkeo's Potential**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 5, Round 11. I've got $36, which is good – maxing out that interest at $5. My current Joker setup is Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg (a decent sell value at $31), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Polychrome Mult), Perkeo (crucial for duplicating consumables), and Blue Joker (+Chips based on deck size). The consumable I'm holding is \"The Moon\" (Negative). Vouchers are Overstock, Clearance Sale, and Reroll Surplus, not directly relevant right now. The shop is offering Sixth Sense ($4) and Mail-In Rebate ($3).\n\nThe main play here is to leverage Perkeo. \"The Moon\" is already in my consumable slot, and Perkeo's ability triggers *at the end of the shop*. This means I need to get out of the shop to trigger it. The command for this is `round_select`.\n\nSixth Sense is tempting, but it requires destroying a 6. My deck isn't built around that, and I need to keep the consumable and hand slots clear. Mail-In Rebate is nice for cash, but I already have $36 plus the $31 from Egg. I don't need the money boost as much as I need Perkeo to work. I'm getting max interest now. I can get max interest if I reroll as well, but the shop doesn't have anything that warrants it.\n\nSince I have 5/5 Jokers, the best move is `round_select` to move to the blind selection screen, which activates Perkeo. No need to sell anything or buy anything else. Let's see... my Flushes will be doing 80 chips with 10 mult, the Jokers combine for 172 chips. The mult is 52.5. This means I should be able to clear blinds in 2 hands.\n\nI considered a quick reroll, but I already rerolled the previous turn. It's not worth it to reroll again. I am not going to use The Moon until Perkeo duplicates it, so it's best to leave it in the inventory.\n\nThe action is clearly `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
