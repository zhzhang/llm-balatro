{"reasoning":"**Prioritizing Value and Scaling**\n\nOkay, so we're at the shop in round 7. Money's decent at $64. The immediate goal is to hit the next blind, and my Flush is at Level 4. I've got a decent Joker setup: Gros Michel, Egg (which I might need to consider selling), Droll Joker with polychrome, Perkeo (the scaling engine), and Delayed Gratification (which I have to use carefully). I also have a Negative Moon, which I want to keep for Perkeo to duplicate.\n\nThe shop offers a few options: Seltzer (retrigger), Mega Arcana Pack, and Spectral Pack. Seltzer seems strong, but I already have five jokers, so I'd need to sell one to buy it. Egg is the easy sell for its immediate money value. I can definitely make the decision later.\n\nThe Mega Arcana pack is always a safe bet, but the Spectral Pack is the real gamble. The Spectral Pack is cheap, and it could dramatically shift the run with something like Aura, Wraith, or Ectoplasm. Ankh could be problematic since it destroys Jokers.\n\nMy focus should be on things that help me win and scale. Perkeo is key. So, I'm going to start with the Spectral Pack since it's cheap and has high potential. Even with the cost, I'll still have enough money for the Mega Arcana pack.\n\nI'll execute `buy_booster 2` for the Spectral Pack. I checked the command and format as well, just to be sure. It's a risk, but it could really pay off. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but a Wraith or Ectoplasm could change things quickly!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
