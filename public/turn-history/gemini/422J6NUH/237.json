{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Flint: A Calculated Flush**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 18, and we're up against \"The Flint\" in the BLIND_SELECT phase. My immediate concern is that this Boss halves both base chips and multiplier, which is a significant handicap. I need 70,000 chips to win. Currently I only have $38, a Flush level of 9, but I have a killer hand and a plan.\n\nI have a powerful hand. My Flush is at level 9, providing 155 chips and a 20x multiplier. My Jokers are: a Droll Joker (Polychrome, +10 Mult on Flush, X1.5 Mult), Ramen (X2 Mult, loses X0.01 per discard), The Tribe (X2 Mult on Flush), Perkeo (Clones consumables, already triggered), and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size - which I can ignore since I am going for a flush). I also have a Negative Jupiter consumable (Level 9, +2 Mult and +15 chips) at position 1. I already used a Jupiter earlier to get the flush to level 9.\n\nI need to maximize my Flush before the battle starts. I had a previous Jupiter that leveled up my flush to level 9. Now I have a second Jupiter to use. Using the Jupiter will bring my flush to level 10. The plan: use the Jupiter.\n\nLevel 10 Flush would give me 170 chips and a 22x multiplier. With \"The Flint's\" effect, this gets halved. So my base stats after the Jupiter will be 85 chips and 11 mult.\n\nNow, let's factor in the Jokers: adding Stuntman's 250 chips gives me a total of 335 chips, and my total mult from all the jokers is: (11 (Base) + 10 (Droll)) * 1.5 (Droll) * 2 (Ramen) * 2 (Tribe) = 126 mult.\nA full calculation should equal: 335 * 126 = 42,210 points per hand. Since I need 70,000 to win, two hands will be enough (42,210 * 2 = 84,420).\n\nSo, the optimal play here is to immediately use the Negative Jupiter consumable (position 1) to get that Flush to Level 10 before starting the round.\n\n*   Action: `use_consumable`\n*   Position: `[1]`\n*   Intended Hand: `flush`\n*   Estimated Chips: `42210`\n\nDouble checking: Does Perkeo trigger in Blind Select? It already has, since it triggered at the end of the shop.\n\nThe plan is solid. Using the consumable makes perfect sense. I am confident in this calculated play.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
