{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Moves**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 6, round 15, and my primary goal is still to maximize my score, particularly through Flushes, and to set up my Jokers effectively for the long run. I'm leveraging the smart play from the previous turn, selling \"The Moon\" to ensure Perkeo clones Jupiter. I have a good setup, and it's time to refine it further.\n\nI have a decent haul in my Joker slots: Gros Michel for the flat mult, Egg for the cash, Droll Joker for the Flush and Poly mult, Perkeo for the legendary consumables, and a Blue Joker for chips. I've also got a Jupiter card in my inventory, which I need to level up my Flushes.\n\nMy current money is at $80, and the shop has some compelling options. Ramen (X2 Mult) is the immediate priority. I need to get that in a Joker slot. I have to think which one to drop, and since the Egg is only worth $43, and I have more than enough money right now to spend, the choice is clear. I can sell the Egg, giving me the space and resources I need.\n\nI will need to run the math for mult. Here is the breakdown:\n* Current setup: (10 + 15 + 10) * 1.5 = 52.5\n* Replacing Michel with Ramen: (10 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 = 60\n* Replacing Egg with Ramen: (10 + 15 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 = 105\n\nThe clear decision is to sell the Egg. This will give me $43.\n\nGiven that I am prioritizing the flush multiplier and have a legendary that can create negative copies of the Jupiter, I have the following actions. First, I need to make space for Ramen. Since I will get the effect of Perkeo at the end of the shop, I need to make sure Jupiter stays in my inventory until the shop is over.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Sell Joker 2** (Egg). Get me the money I need, and the Joker slot I need to open up.\n2.  **Buy Card 1** (Ramen). I'm buying the Ramen and putting it into my hand.\n3.  **Buy Booster 1** (Jumbo Celestial Pack). A quick grab to find more Jupiter/Flushes.\n4.  **Buy Booster 2** (Celestial Pack). A second grab to find more Jupiter/Flushes.\n\nI need to make sure to save the Jupiter card so that Perkeo has something to clone at the end of the shop. I will wait for Perkeo's trigger.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
