{"reasoning":"**My Current Thought Process**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 7, Round 16, and close to moving onto the next Ante. I have a solid Flush-focused build going. I have $63, and the shop is... not great. My Jokers are excellent for this Flush strategy: Droll Joker adds +10 Mult to Flushes and multiplies the total by 1.5, Ramen provides a flat X2 multiplier with a small discard penalty, The Tribe provides X2 Mult on Flushes, Perkeo is the Legendary Joker, the critical Joker here, which will create a Negative copy of the consumable I'm holding at the *end of the shop*, and Stuntman provides +250 Chips, but reduces hand size by 2, which is negligible, given current hand size. I've also got the Jupiter consumable, which is a level 5 Flush. My priority is to maximize Flush scores and I'm leveraging Perkeo for long-term scaling, by keeping Jupiter so I can generate more copies of Jupiter at the end of each shop.\n\nThe shop itself is useless; Judgement that gives a random Joker (I have no space), Sly Joker (+50 Chips, irrelevant), and Hallucination for Tarot chance (requires space, no boosters currently). I'm not buying anything. I need to leave the shop *with* Jupiter in my inventory to trigger Perkeo.\n\nI've already rerolled multiple times in this shop, and the reroll cost is now $7. With $63, it's not the end of the world, but it's becoming less efficient.\n\nThe Jokers are already strong for Flush-building with Stuntman for Chips, Droll/Ramen/Tribe all contributing high multipliers. I don't need anything in the shop. The goal is to get to the next round to keep scaling and beat the blinds. I think I've re-rolled too many times in this shop ($4, $5, $6).\n\nMy build can handle it; I'm pretty sure I could get 45,000, 20-30k for small blind, 40k for big, I'm safe.\n\nI've got $63. Should I reroll again? I could reroll one more time and still be above $50 to max interest. The description says \"you will earn an additional $1 of interest for each $5 you have at the end of the round.\" I need to start reading this more closely. I don't need anything in the shop. I'll pass on a reroll.\n\nWait, the Perkeo description says the negative copy is created at the *end of the shop*. By selecting a new round, I end the shop. I definitely want to keep that Jupiter to get its Negative copy.\n\nShould I rearrange my Jokers for optimal order? I have Droll (+10 Mult, X1.5), Ramen (X2), Tribe (X2), Perkeo, and Stuntman. Order is important, the math is (Base + Stuntman) * (Base Mult + Droll Additive) * (Droll Multiplicative) * (Ramen) * (Tribe). The order should be: Droll (+10 Mult), Droll (X1.5 Mult), Ramen, Tribe. The additive is before the multiplicative. It's Droll - (addition) - (multiplication). Perfect.\n\nJust one final detail check: Droll is a Polychrome edition. That adds x1.5 Mult. So it's +10 Mult, then x1.5 Mult. I'm ready to move to Round Select.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
