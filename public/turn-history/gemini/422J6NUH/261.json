{"reasoning":"**Current Strategic Analysis: Ante 8, Final Push**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the final ante, Round 20, and down to my last $29. I've got a solid Flush build going, level 12, with a hand that's already hitting pretty hard – roughly 97,000 per hand. I have a Droll Joker, which is key for the flush multiplier, along with Ramen and The Tribe for multipliers, and Stuntman for chips. The real wildcard here is Perkeo, the Legendary Joker, which clones a consumable. Currently, I'm holding a Judgement Tarot, but ideally, I want something better for long-term scaling, like a Planet card.\n\nMy immediate goal is to win this ante, and I need to maximize my score right now. I'm looking at this shop and trying to figure out if it offers an immediate, significant boost. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the shop cards: 8 Ball is useless, Crazy Joker is also useless. Arrowhead is decent for chips, but Stuntman already does the job. That leaves Blackboard. Blackboard offers a potential x3 multiplier if my hand is all Spades and/or Clubs, which is huge! I need to determine if it's better than Ramen or The Tribe. My deck is built for Flushes, so I likely have a suit-heavy deck. \n\nThe trouble is, I can't see my deck composition. If my flush is Hearts or Diamonds, Blackboard is dead weight.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, and considering the importance of Perkeo, I'm going to *reroll* the shop. The reroll costs $5, so I'll have $24 left. If I find a Jupiter, that's immediate, permanent scaling with Perkeo, which is far more valuable than a shot in the dark with Blackboard.\n\nSo, I will reroll once more.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
