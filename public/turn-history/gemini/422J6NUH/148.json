{"reasoning":"**Current Round Decision: Let's Get This Show on the Road**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase for the Boss Blind of Ante 5, facing \"The Mark,\" which means any cards I draw *after* a hand is played are flipped face down. I need 22,000 chips, and I have a $5 reward on the line. I'm sitting on $29, but that's not the priority right now.\n\nMy inventory is as follows: Gros Michel (a solid +15 Mult), Egg (which sells for some cash), Droll Joker (essential for Flushes, +10 Mult and x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (my consumable-duplicating friend), and Blue Joker (the chips-giver, currently +94). I also have two copies of \"The Moon,\" which can convert three cards to Clubs, courtesy of Perkeo.\n\nI'm ready to play, and the command to start the round, `play_round`, is available. The available commands are: `\"play_round\", \"use_consumable\", \"sell_consumable\", \"rearrange_jokers\", \"sell_joker\"`. Before hitting `play_round`, I need to make sure I'm positioned for success.\n\nFirst, the Joker order. Gros Michel's additive Mult should be at the top of the list, followed by Droll Joker. This ensures the calculation (Base + 15 + 10) * 1.5. Egg and Perkeo don't directly impact scoring, and Blue Joker is purely chip-based, so its position doesn't matter for the multiplicative Jokers. The current order is fine.\n\nI can't use \"The Moon\" right now as I am still in Blind Select.\n\nThe round has to start. There is no reason to sell or rearrange.\n\nI know from previous rounds that I can probably hit around 10k chips per Flush with my current build. So, I'm aiming for two Flushes to hit the 22k target for the Boss. The \"The Mark\" Boss makes things interesting. The boss text is, \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\", which affects me after each hand.\n\nConsidering the \"The Mark\" boss effect, my strategy will be as follows: use discards to find those clubs, and set up a solid first hand. The new cards drawn after the first hand *will* be face down. Since discards are safe, I should use those to set up my Flushes. I want to win in as few hands as possible.\n\nI'm checking: Gros Michel (15), Egg (37), Droll (10 + x1.5), Perkeo, Blue Joker (+ Chips).\nThe order is correct. It's time.\n\nI will `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
