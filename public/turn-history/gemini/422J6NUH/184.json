{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Prioritizing Flash Card & Joker Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for this shop phase. Ante 6, Round 15, and I have $103. The primary focus right now is to maximize the scaling of \"Flash Card\" (+2 Mult per reroll). It's currently at +0 Mult and the reroll cost is $8. I need to get this thing up.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure my Jokers are in the *right* order. I've got a Droll Joker (Polychrome, +10 Mult, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (Legendary, Negative consumable), Blue Joker (+Chips), Ramen (x2 Mult, which is amazing), and Flash Card (+ Mult). I need to make sure those multipliers are firing at the best possible time.\n\nThe general rule is additive mult first, then multiplicative. Flash Card and Droll need to go *before* Ramen. Currently, Flash Card is at the *end*. Not ideal. The ideal order is Blue Joker (Chips) in the front, followed by Flash Card, Droll (with +10 and x1.5), Perkeo (for utility, doesn't matter where it is), and Ramen (x2) at the end. I should rearrange.\n\nWait, let's confirm. I'm going to *reroll* and I'm going to start with a Flash Card reroll. I need to keep $25 for max interest, but I can afford a few rerolls here. The shop has Trading Card ($4) and Odd Todd ($3), but they're not a priority with my current build. Trading Card would be good if I needed to thin the deck. But I don't. I have 5 really good jokers and don't plan to sell any.\n\nI can't forget about Perkeo. Perkeo triggers at the *end* of the shop. I need to keep Jupiter (Level up Flush) in my consumable slots when I leave the shop so Perkeo can duplicate it.\n\nSo, the action plan: I'm going to **reroll the shop** as many times as I can afford. I'll need to keep a balance between scaling the Flash Card and keeping enough cash to generate interest and prepare for future shops. Then, I will **rearrange the Joker order** before I finish, ensuring Flash Card is at the optimal spot.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
