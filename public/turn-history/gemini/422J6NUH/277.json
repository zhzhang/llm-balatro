{"reasoning":"**Here's how I'm thinking through this Balatro hand:**\n\nOkay, Final Ante, so I'm laser-focused on maximizing my Flush build. I've got $12, which is decent, but at this stage, it's all about score. My strategy is firmly Flush-centric, with a strong Level 13 Flush and a solid Joker lineup (The Tribe, Droll Joker, Ramen, Stuntman, and Brainstorm). My deck is already heavily weighted towards Clubs from previous turns, which is key.\n\nLooking at these pack choices, things get interesting. I see a Gold 7 of Spades, a Lucky 9 of Spades, and a Holographic 7 of Hearts. The Gold card offers a bit of money if I hold it, but at this stage in the game, that's less important than immediate scoring. The Lucky card is tempting with its potential for big mult, but it's unreliable, and the small chance of a big payout isn't what I need.\n\nThen, there's the 7 of Hearts. This Holographic card immediately grabs my attention. It gives a solid +10 Mult, which is always welcome. *And*, crucially, it *creates a Tarot card when discarded*. I'm thinking, this is the key. Tarot cards can be game-changers! I'm hoping for a Tarot that can help my Flush strategy. Since the deck is skewed towards Clubs, I'm thinking of trying to obtain a Tarot to convert other suits into Clubs, as I already have a very high-powered flush build.\n\nNow, I'm second-guessing. A Heart card *could* dilute my Club-focused Flush if drawn. Stuntman has -2 hand size. Still, the +10 Mult from the Holographic card is too good to pass up, and the potential Tarot card generation makes this a high-value card. I'll need to use Tarots to assist in drawing Clubs or converting non-Club cards, since I can't guarantee a flush now.\n\nI'm now running the numbers in my head. I do a quick calculation of the score I would have if I played a flush with and without the Holo card. The Holo card adds significant value. Then I run through the Joker lineup, checking what their effects are on the chip count and mult. If I *can't* draw a flush, I can discard the Holo card for a Tarot, which could salvage the hand.\n\n**Decision:** I'm going for the 7 of Hearts (Holographic). The +10 Mult is excellent, and the Tarot card generation gives me flexibility. The command is `select 3`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
