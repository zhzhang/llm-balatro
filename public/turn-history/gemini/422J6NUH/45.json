{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Analysis and Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm in Ante 3, Round 6, with $18 in the bank. The shop is laid out, and I need to make a solid decision here. I’ve already got \"The Moon\" which is key because I have Perkeo, and I want to duplicate The Moon at the end of the shop. I'm playing a flush-heavy build, and I need to boost it.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure \"The Moon\" is secure, that's paramount. Next, I'm eyeing the other items. I'm not really considering \"Hanging Chad\" right now because I don't want to sell any of my joker slots. The \"Egg\" is potentially good for value, and Gros Michel, Droll Joker, Perkeo and Delayed Gratification are already in play.\n\nThe real questions are the packs: the Arcana Pack and the Jumbo Celestial Pack. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is looking good to level up a Flush (Jupiter is what I'm hoping for). I have two consumable slots, and Perkeo needs something to grab a copy of.\n\nMy plan: I’m thinking I’ll buy both the Celestial and Arcana packs before the voucher. That's a total cost of $7. I have $18, so that leaves me with $11 after buying those two.\n\nOkay, let's break this down further. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is used immediately, so it levels up the hand before Perkeo triggers at the end of the shop. I need to make sure to buy it before I consider anything else, because the boost is important for my build. This would be action `buy_booster 2`.\n\nNow, if I buy and use the pack, that happens during the shop, and I should be able to continue on. I'm going to grab that now.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\nOkay, now that's done.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
