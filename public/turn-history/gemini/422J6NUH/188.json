{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action - Ante 6, Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, Round 15. Got $82, and we're in the SHOP phase. My main goal here is to maximize my score with a flush build, and to prepare for the next round. Right now, I'm working with these Jokers: Droll Joker (+10 Mult if Flush, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (Negative consumable copy), Blue Joker (+94 Chips), Ramen (x2 Mult), and The Tribe (x2 Mult if Flush). My consumable is Jupiter (Flush lvl 4). I have all five Joker slots filled, and am at two consumables max, and I only have one Jupiter.\n\nThe core strategy here is to optimize the scoring order: Chips first, then additive Multiplier, then multiplicative Multiplier.\n\nI have a Blue Joker giving me a flat +94 chips, a Droll Joker with +10 Multiplier and x1.5 Multiplier (specifically if the hand has a flush), a Ramen Joker with x2 Multiplier, and The Tribe Joker with x2 Multiplier (if the hand is a flush).\n\nBased on this, I'm thinking the following Joker order: Blue Joker (chips), Droll Joker (+10, then x1.5), Ramen (x2), The Tribe (x2). Perkeo is a utility Joker that copies a consumable at the end of the shop. Its position doesn't impact score directly.\n\nI've got a couple of shop cards: Smiley Face ($3), and Pluto ($2). Smiley Face could be useful but I have no room, while Pluto is useless for my build. The current reroll cost is $10, which I can afford. However, the flash card scaling strategy is over since I sold it for The Tribe.\n\nNow, because I have Perkeo, I need to keep the Jupiter. Perkeo triggers *after* the shop, so my order is somewhat flexible.\n\nI think I should rearrange my Jokers for that optimal scoring. The most efficient order right now is: Blue Joker (3), Droll Joker (1), Ramen (4), The Tribe (5), and Perkeo (2).\n\nHowever, before I leave, there is an important detail. Since I have $82, I can reroll to look for more Jupiters. I am using a flush build. I have the option to buy Smiley Face but I currently have no room for it. I will keep the consumables I have.\n\nSo, let's rearrange Jokers based on what I have and how to make this work best. I currently have Droll as my first joker, Perkeo as second, Blue Joker as third, Ramen as fourth, and Tribe as fifth.\n\nTo be most effective, the best order is Blue (3, chips), then Droll (1, +mult), then Ramen (4, x mult), and The Tribe (5, x mult), and Perkeo (2, utility). This gives an output: `rearrange_jokers 3 1 4 5 2`.\nI will confirm I don't need to reroll. I only have one Jupiter, so let's keep it.\n\nI will `rearrange_jokers` to 3, 1, 4, 5, 2.\n\nLet's double check.\n\n*   Blue Joker (3): Chips.\n*   Droll Joker (1): +10 and X1.5.\n*   Ramen (4): X2.\n*   The Tribe (5): X2.\n*   Perkeo (2): N/A.\n\nThis is the order I want.\n\nFinal action: `rearrange_jokers 3 1 4 5 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [3,1,4,5,2]"}
