{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Strategy: Maximize Flash Card Scaling**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante is 6, we're in Round 15, and it's SHOP time. I've got $107, which is a decent starting point. My current inventory is:\n\n*   **Jokers:** Droll Joker (Flush Mult, Polychrome Mult), Perkeo (Consumable Duplication), Blue Joker (+Chips per Card), and Ramen (Mult, but loses per discard).\n*   **Consumables:** Jupiter (Levels Flush)\n\nI'm sitting at 4/5 Joker slots and 1/2 Consumable slots. The game is setting me up to be a late-game juggernaut, so I need to make the most of what I have. My core engine is *definitely* Perkeo + Jupiter to level up my Flushes.\n\nIn this shop, I have the following cards:\n\n1.  Flash Card (+2 Mult per reroll)\n2.  Trading Card\n3.  Odd Todd\n\nI'm lucky enough to have these vouchers as well: Blank, Overstock (+1 shop slot), Clearance Sale (25% off), and Reroll Surplus ($2 less). The \"Reroll Surplus\" voucher is crucial here, as it directly synergizes with my goal of scaling up the \"Flash Card\" as it gets stronger with each reroll.\n\nI've got the strategic vision: sell the Gros Michel (which is done - **previous action was `sell_joker 1`**), and now my immediate next step is to grab that \"Flash Card\" from the shop! I need that sweet, sweet Mult scaling. This card needs to be in my deck for future rerolls. I am not going to use Jupiter yet, I need it to stay so Perkeo can duplicate it at the end of the round.\n\nAlright, time to execute. I need to:\n\n1.  **Buy \"Flash Card\".** That's my top priority. Then, and only then, do I start burning money on rerolls, hoping to find more useful cards (Tarot or Planet packs, mainly). Buying Flash Card ensures that the more I reroll, the better this card gets.\n\nThe action is pretty clear here: `buy_card 1`. Cost is $4, which I can absolutely afford ($107 - $4 = $103 remaining). Joker slots are fine, I'm at 4/5. There's no reason *not* to do it. It's the strategically sound move, given my current setup and the synergies available.\n\nSo, the action is `buy_card 1`. Let's get to it!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
