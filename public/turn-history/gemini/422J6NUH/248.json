{"reasoning":"**Reroll for Victory**\n\nOkay, here we go. Final Ante, Round 19, money is at $36, and it's time to make this count. My goal is simple: maximize that final boss score. I've got a decent hand setup already, leaning towards a Flush (level 10) or Straight Flush (level 6), but I need to make sure this is the best it can be. Right now, the plan is to use that Perkeo to duplicate Neptune and level that Straight Flush, which looks like the winning ticket.\n\nThe current shop cards are a bit lackluster – Earth, Mad Joker, Sly Joker, and Popcorn. Not ideal, and definitely not worth buying. I've got a solid Joker lineup: Droll Joker for a mult boost, Ramen and The Tribe for multipliers, Perkeo to duplicate a consumable, and Stuntman for chip generation. Popcorn could add some immediate mult, but I'm not swapping anything out. My Joker slots are full and those jokers are key.\n\nNow, I've got $36 and rerolls cost $3. Overstock Plus gave me a fourth shop slot. Perkeo works at the *end* of the shop. I should *not* use Neptune yet because Perkeo will copy the single Neptune. I need to keep that in mind.\n\nSo, the play is to reroll and hunt for a better Joker or, ideally, a Neptune planet to build that Straight Flush further. I've got the Overstock Plus voucher to give me an extra reroll.\n\nLet's double-check the rules. Perkeo gives me a negative copy of one consumable at the *end* of the shop. So, any new consumables I find in the re-roll before I move on will be duplicated. This is the start of Ante 8. I have at least two more shops (Small and Big Blinds) before the final Boss.\n\nGiven that this is the final ante, spending to improve is the right play.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\n\nI just need to focus. Is there any reason to rearrange Jokers? My current arrangement seems optimal, with multipliers activating in a way that should maximize the final score. + chips from Stuntman don't matter (I think), as they are added at the end. I re-checked my calculations, and there is no reason to rearrange Jokers.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\n\nJust double-checking - are any of the shop cards worth buying? Nope.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\n\nNeed to find those Neptunes or Jupiter, and I'm ready to roll.\n\nFinally, just a quick sanity check to be sure: If I pick up a Neptune, I should make sure I only have one, because Perkeo only duplicates one.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
