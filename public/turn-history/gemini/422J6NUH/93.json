{"reasoning":"**Round 10 Shop Analysis**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 10 with an ante of 4. My goal is to be prepped for that nasty 20,000 chip Boss Blind - the \"Extra large blind.\" I have $39 to work with, which is pretty comfortable. My current Jokers are looking decent: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($28 value), Droll Joker (Flush +10 Mult, x1.5 Mult, Polychrome x1.5), Perkeo (Legendary, negative copy of consumable) and Blue Joker (+92 Chips). I also have two \"The Moon\" consumables - both negative.\n\nMy build is centered around Flushes, which, at level 4, get me 80 chips and 10 multiplier, and Droll Joker gets a bonus from the hand type. Given my Perkeo Joker, I will also have a negative \"The Moon\" consumable, as I have at least one consumable in my possession.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see Space Joker ($4), which is too unreliable, Fortune Teller (+11 Mult), which is inferior to Gros Michel, Standard Pack ($3) which is not my priority, a Celestial Pack ($3), and a Magic Trick voucher ($7). The Magic Trick voucher is also not my priority.\n\nThe *Celestial Pack* is the clear winner here. It's the best value for $3 to improve my core scoring mechanism by leveling up my flush. I'll get that first. I'm leaving the buy_booster at position 2 (Celestial Pack), and that leaves me with $36. I will then have to evaluate other purchases. I will also have to check if I can sell anything, but I have space in my pack opening. Perkeo only triggers when I leave the shop. Buying the Celestial Pack first maximizes the available options.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
