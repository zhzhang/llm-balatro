{"reasoning":"**Rerolling the Shop: A Calculated Gamble**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 4, Round 10. The ultimate goal here is Boss Blind, which requires 20,000 chips. I have $36, but I keep remembering that the current state says $39... let's stick with $36 for now, for the sake of caution. My Joker lineup is solid: Gros Michel is great for Mult, the Egg is a cash cow, Droll Joker offers Mult and xMult scaling, Perkeo is a utility, and Blue Joker adds chips.\n\nThe shop is... underwhelming. Space Joker is too risky, Fortune Teller is only +11 and I've got Gros Michel at +15. No need to buy cards. Magic Trick is not optimal. The Reroll Surplus voucher means rerolling the shop costs only $3.\n\nI need to balance money for interest (I'll cap at $25 to earn $5), with searching for powerful Jokers. I also want to keep the Egg in the mix; it's currently worth $28. It's a gold mine.\n\nPerkeo is going to make a negative copy of one of \"The Moon\" cards, which is great for suit consistency. I don't need to buy anything specifically for Perkeo to have this effect.\n\nThe current shop options are weak, but with Clearance Sale, a reroll is a viable option to find better Jokers or Planets (especially Jupiter).\n\nDo I reroll or go to round select? Reroll cost is $3 and money is $36, so I can afford a few rerolls while staying above $25. Finding a better scaling joker or Jupiter is worth it.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange my jokers to make sure the order is optimal: Chips (Blue Joker) -> +Mult (Gros Michel, Droll) -> xMult (Droll, Polychrome). Gros Michel (15 Mult), Droll Joker (+10, x1.5, x1.5). This is correct.\n\nI'm thinking about the shop. I could check the Standard Pack, but \"The Moon\" handles suits. I'll take a single reroll to look for a Jupiter or a better Joker. I can afford it.\n\nSo, I reroll. Current money $36 to $33. Still above $25 interest cap.\n\nWait, should I buy the Standard Pack? No. Fortune Teller is +11 Mult. If I use more Tarots, it scales. But I'm flush-heavy and Gros Michel is +15. If Michel breaks, Fortune Teller is a backup. Space is full. Reroll is the play.\n\nLet's double-check the previous turn: Turn 94, shop info was the same. Did I not reroll yet? Yes, rerolling is logical now. I'm flush level 4, and straight level 2.\n\nIs there any reason to go to round select? Saving money? But finding Jupiter or a better Joker is more valuable than $1 interest.\n\nOkay, let's provide the JSON.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, I need to make sure I cannot use \"The Moon\" now. I'm in the shop. I do not have poker cards in my hand (only in the select stage or in packs). So `use_consumable` won't work for a suit-converter.\n\nLet's stick with reroll\\_shop. I just remembered that Perkeo creates a Negative copy of a random consumable in possession *at the end of the shop*. I have two Moons. This is good.\n\n\"Space Joker\" and \"Fortune Teller\" are available. Space Joker is okay if I have a free slot, but I don't. Reroll it is.\n\nWait, if I'm satisfied, the user might want me to just `round_select`. But the shop has 1 Standard Pack and 2 mediocre Jokers. Rerolling to look for a Planet (Jupiter) or a better Joker (since Gros Michel might break) is better.\n\nI have 5/5 Jokers. To buy a new one, I'd have to sell one.\nCurrent Jokers:\n1. Gros Michel (+15)\n2. Egg ($28)\n3. Droll (+10, x1.5, x1.5)\n4. Perkeo (Legendary)\n5. Blue Joker (+Chips)\n\nIf I find a better Joker, I'd probably sell Gros Michel or Blue Joker (if the deck gets small) or eventually the Egg.\nActually, selling the Egg for $28 is a huge influx\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
