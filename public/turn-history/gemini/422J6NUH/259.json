{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante 8 Shop**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 8, Round 20, the shop phase. My goal is clear: beat this boss and win the game, focusing on a Flush build, which I've got at Level 12. I've got a decent set of Jokers: Droll Joker (which is great), Ramen (which is good), The Tribe (which helps my Flush, important for this build), Perkeo (my consumable copier), and Stuntman (for chip generation, super useful). Money is at $35.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see The Order (a polychrome joker, but doesn't synergize with my jokers right now, and would require selling one), Egg (late game useless), Raised Fist (meh), and Judgement, a Tarot card (a consumable, which is *key* right now).\n\nPerkeo needs a consumable to function. Currently, I have none. Judgement would fix that. If I buy Judgement, Perkeo will create a negative copy of it at the end of the shop. I could use the Judgement card to get a joker (not good, since I'm full on joker slots), so the goal is to *not* use it and let Perkeo copy it. This is useful because negative consumables don't take up a slot. A negative judgement every round is okay, but not the best outcome. A planet card (like Jupiter) would be ideal.\n\nI have $35. Judgement costs $2. Rerolling the shop costs $4. So I could buy Judgement, which leaves me with $33 and a Perkeo-copying consumable, or reroll the shop at $31, hoping for a Jupiter or another Planet card. I need to win Ante 8, so I need as much power as I can get. Since I'm on the boss level, I'm thinking the best move is to make sure Perkeo gets *something* to copy.\n\nI need to quickly assess my Jokers. Droll: great. Ramen: good. The Tribe: good. Perkeo: essential utility. Stuntman: Good for Chips. The shop has nothing that can currently replace any of those jokers (The Order would be ok in a multi-joker build). So, it's Judgement and Perkeo for now. \n\nBuying Judgement guarantees that Perkeo triggers. I can always reroll *after* buying Judgement if I want to seek out a Jupiter, but Judgement's already there for only $2. It's a solid, safe, smart play.\n\nSo the action is: `buy_card 4`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [4]"}
