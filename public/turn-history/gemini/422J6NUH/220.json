{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop: Perkeo Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 18, and it's shop time. I've got $80, and my Jokers are pretty solid: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo (Legendary, duplicates consumables, the key player here!), and Stuntman. The Flush is leveled up to Level 8, with a base of 140 chips and an 18 multiplier. The goal is to maximize my score and prepare for this upcoming Boss blind, The Flint, which halves my base chips and mult. My hand strength has to be higher than ever.\n\nThe critical thing is Perkeo. Right now, Perkeo is useless because I have no consumables. I need to *buy* a consumable card and *hold* it in my inventory until the end of the shop phase for Perkeo to duplicate it. So I need to secure a consumable first.\n\nLet's see what's on offer. There's Supernova, Saturn, and Luchador. Supernova would give a +22 mult, but that's not worth swapping one of my already great Jokers. Luchador might be good for the boss, but my Flush is very strong, and I can probably use two of them.\n\nSaturn is the most immediate choice here. It levels up straights. It's not my ideal hand, but it *is* a consumable. I can buy it for $2, and it will go right into my inventory.\n\nI also see Jumbo and regular Arcana packs. Those *should* contain Tarot cards that I can hold, maybe something like The Fool or The Star. If I buy either pack, I *must* use it immediately. The Saturn is a guarenteed consumable trigger for Perkeo.\n\nI'm thinking: buy Saturn first, then reroll the shop for something better if I still have the funds.\n\nBut wait. My first priority is Perkeo. I can get a consumable for $2, which is cheap insurance. My thinking:\n\n1.  `buy_card` position 2 (Saturn). This puts Saturn in my inventory.\n2.  I can always sell or use it later if something better turns up. But $2 is a small price to pay for Perkeo.\n3.  I need to ensure I can beat this Boss. Since the boss halves my chip and mult, I need a very large score to win. I only have to beat it once.\n4.  Re-checking my work - yes, buying Saturn *first* is the right move. I need a consumable in my inventory at the *end* of the shop. I'll get that with Saturn.\n\nSo the plan: `{\"action\": \"buy_card\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
