{"reasoning":"**Shop Reroll Analysis**\n\nOkay, Ante 6, Round 15. I've got $112. The goal is to beat Ante 8. Flushes (Level 4) is the current strategic focus. I need to keep the Jupiter consumable for the Perkeo synergy, which creates a negative copy at the end of the shop, this is key for scaling up. My current Jokers are Gros Michel (+15 mult), Droll Joker (+10 mult on Flushes/x1.5 mult), Perkeo (Crucial for the Jupiter), Blue Joker (+94 chips), and Ramen (x2 mult). I'm currently in the shop phase, and have Rocket (Foil) and 8 Ball available.\n\nGiven the Joker effects and the game's scoring order (Boss Blinds -> \"On Played\" Jokers -> Card Scoring (Chips, then Card Enhancements, then Card-based Multipliers, then 'On Scored' Jokers) -> Held-in-hand Jokers -> Independent Jokers (left-to-right)), I've worked out the optimal Joker ordering. Since I want +Mult applied before xMult, and since Droll Joker has both, the right order is Gros Michel (1), Droll Joker (2), Perkeo (3), Blue Joker (4), and Ramen (5). This ensures Gros Michel's +15 mult is applied first, then Droll Joker's +10 mult and x1.5 mult, and finally Ramen's x2 mult. The Blue Joker's chip bonus doesn't depend on its position in the list, since it's applied during the card scoring.\n\nRegarding the shop cards, Rocket (Foil) seems tempting for the +50 chips, but Blue Joker already provides a larger chip bonus, and selling another Joker to take Rocket wouldn't be as efficient. 8 Ball, with its chance for a Tarot card, isn't compelling enough to replace any of my current Jokers.\n\nGiven my money ($112) and the cheap reroll cost ($3 due to the Reroll Surplus), rerolling the shop is the most logical move to hunt for better Jokers, Planet packs, or Tarot cards. I'm going to run through all other options first, though. No vouchers or boosters, I'll hold the Jupiter, and I won't sell anything. The Joker order is ideal. So, it's time to `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
