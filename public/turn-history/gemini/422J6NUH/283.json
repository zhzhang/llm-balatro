{"reasoning":"**Flush Optimization - Final Boss Showdown**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan: Ante 8, Round 22, and the goal is a cool 100,000 chips. The boss, Cerulean Bell, forces us to select a specific card. Right now, I've got a killer Flush: Ace, Queen, two 10s, and an 8 of Clubs, all Clubs.  We've got the forced 10 of Clubs at index 4, which has to be used.\n\nMy hand calculation is: 215k base from the Flush plus the multipliers, Joker bonuses from Tribe, Droll, Ramen, Brainstorm, and Stuntman.\n\nMy jokers are: Tribe (x2 Flush), Droll Joker (+10 Mult, x1.5 Edition), Ramen (x2 Mult), Stuntman (+250 Chips), and Brainstorm (Copies leftmost). I also have two consumables: Judgement and The Chariot (Steel Card).\n\nFirst, let's optimize that Joker order.  The goal is to maximize the mult. After thinking it through, I’ve decided the optimal Joker order:  Droll Joker (at index 1), Brainstorm (at index 2), The Tribe (at index 3), Ramen (at index 4), and Stuntman (at index 5).\n\nI've recalculated the score: chips are 544. The key is to get that mult as high as possible. The calculated mult with the new order is 402. That gives us a score of 218,688 chips.\n\nNow, that's already well over the 100,000 target. However, The Chariot gives me x1.5 mult if I turn a card into steel and keep it in hand.  So, if I use Chariot on the 5 of Clubs, mult would increase to 603 giving me a whopping 328,032.\n\nGiven the optimization and the win conditions, that's the best score.\n\nThe question is, do I need to rearrange Jokers, use a consumable (Chariot), or just play? Given the \"forced card\" logic and my high estimated score, it's best to take the action that ensures winning the round. I'll take a look at the forced card and play the flush.\n\n*   Hand: Ace, Queen, 10, 10, 8 (all clubs).\n*   Forced card index: 4 (10 of Clubs).\n*   Hand type: Flush.\n*   Estimated score with the multipliers: ~328,032.\n\nFinal Decision: Since I've already figured out the Joker order, let's play the hand!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
