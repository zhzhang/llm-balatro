{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop. Ante 3, Round 7. I've got $31, and a $10 reroll cost, which I think is a bit steep given the current state of the game. My goal is to maximize a Flush score, and Perkeo is my key asset here. Let's see, I've got Gros Michel (+15 Mult - risky!), Egg (scaling sell value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult on Flush, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (clones a consumable), and Crafty Joker (+80 Chips on Flush). I also have \"The Moon\" (Negative - converts cards to Clubs).\n\nRerolling would leave me with $21, which drops me below the interest cap. Keeping the money gives me interest, but the shop cards, Runner and Wily Joker, are useless for my Flush strategy. Plus, since \"The Moon\" is already in play, and it's negative, Perkeo will clone it, giving me another copy. Having multiple \"The Moon\" cards is a huge boon for deck fixing.\n\nRerolling seems too inefficient right now given that I already have \"The Moon\" for the Perkeo strategy. The current Jokers are solid enough for Ante 3. Time to move on.\n\nWait, I was rerolling for Jupiter. Is it worth it for $10 to see two more cards? Probably not. I'll save the money for later.\n\nLet's order the Jokers. Gros Michel (1), Egg (2), Droll (3), Perkeo (4), Crafty (5). Wait, actually, Chips (Crafty) doesn't care about the position, so the order doesn't matter much... or does it? I should move Droll to position 5, to make sure its x1.5 triggers last. Now, it's Gros (1), Egg (2), Perkeo (3), Crafty (4), Droll (5). Wait, maybe I should just select \"round_select\".\n\nThe shop is not worth rerolling. \"The Moon\" for Perkeo is the play. I'll stick with what I have.\n\nWait a second, did I miss anything? Wait! Negative \"The Moon\" is key to the Perkeo engine!\n\nOkay, I'm checking previous actions. In Turn 71, I had $40 and then I rerolled.\n\nI just went from $40 to $31. If I reroll again, I go to $21, which is below the interest cap, and I've got nothing in the shop anyway. The shop still has nothing. I'll choose to proceed.\n\nWait, no vouchers or boosters. I've got everything I've got.\n\nDroll Joker at position 3 is fine, or at the end is fine. Actually, it's optimal.\n\nNo, I'm not going to buy any consumables.\n\nOh, and I just noticed the secondary description of both \"The Moon\" and Perkeo have \"+1 consumable slot\"! Max consumables is 3 and I have 1. Plenty of room.\n\nI have a plan: Perkeo engine. Negative copy of \"The Moon\" and accumulate \"The Moon\" cards. I'm definitely *not* using this card yet. This is the optimal strategy.\n\nOkay, here we go, Final decision: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
