{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization: Flush Build Finale**\n\nOkay, here we are, Round 21, the final ante. Shop phase. I've got $21, and the target is the final boss with 100,000 chips. My current build is flush-focused – Flush Level 13, yielding 215 chips and a 28x multiplier. My Joker lineup is solid: The Tribe (x2 Flush), Droll (Polychrome, +10 mult, x1.5), Ramen (x2), Stuntman (+250 chips), and Brainstorm (copying Tribe).\n\nCurrently, my multiplier sits at (28 + 10) * 2 * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 38 * 12 = 456. My chip count, including the Flush and Stuntman, is roughly 490. This puts my expected score at around 490 * 456 ≈ 223,440. I'm already well past the required 100k, which is great.\n\nIn the shop, I see Venus, Mercury, and Pluto, but those are irrelevant to this build. I'm also presented with a Standard Pack and a Celestial Pack, both priced at $3, along with a $3 reroll. Given my build's focus, the Celestial Pack is the clear priority. I just used Jupiter to level up my Flush, so another Jupiter is the absolute best-case scenario. The Standard Pack might refine the deck but is less important, and the reroll is a distant third.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to buy the Celestial Pack. The action is `buy_booster` and the Celestial Pack is in position `[2]`.\n\nThe action I'll take is `buy_booster 2`.\n\nNow, let's craft the correct JSON. I just need a valid JSON, no extra text.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON follows the schema, is a single block, uses double quotes for strings, and is parseable. I'm confident in this and ready to submit the command.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
