{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Boss Blind: A Calculated Risk**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 1, Round 2. I've got $6, a Gros Michel joker which is my current carry piece, and an Egg that's steadily increasing in value. I also have The Chariot consumable, ready to enhance a card. The shop has a Standard Pack and that's it that I can afford (the Wee Joker is tempting but too expensive). My goal is to beat The Pillar boss blind, which debuffs hand types I played in the prior round. Last round I played a Three of a Kind and a Flush, so those are out.\n\nI need to decide how to spend my money. I could buy the Standard Pack, but I'm hesitant. It'll cost me a dollar in interest, and I am not really sure if it's worth it in the long run. I'd rather save up for interest.\n\nThe Chariot is tempting, but I should hold onto it for a potentially stronger hand down the road, maybe an Ace later in a round.\n\nSo, how do I beat The Pillar? The debuffs mean I have to think carefully. A High Card with the Gros Michel could do the trick, but it's risky since it's only 80 chips. A Pair of high cards (with the Hierophant card I made last turn) would probably get me more than enough. Two Pair is a sure thing (680 chips) with my multipliers.\n\nMy best move is to save my money for interest. No need to buy the pack. I can go to the Blind now.\n\nAction: `round_select`\nReasoning: I have enough scoring potential with Gros Michel and the bonus cards created last turn to beat the Boss Blind (600 chips). Two Pair or a Pair of high cards (with the bonus chips from the Hierophant) should be sufficient. Saving money to hit interest thresholds is the priority.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
