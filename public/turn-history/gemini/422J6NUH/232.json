{"reasoning":"**My Assessment of the Pre-Boss Shop**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7, Round 18, and The Flint awaits – the boss that halves my base chips and multiplier. I have $53 and a solid Joker setup: Droll (x1.5), Ramen (x2, degrading), The Tribe (x2 on Flush), Perkeo (Legendary, clones a random consumable), and Stuntman (+250 chips, -2 hand size). My immediate priority is beating The Flint. I'm holding a Jupiter consumable (Lvl 8 Flush). My max Jokers and Consumables are 5/5 and 2/2, respectively (Perkeo adds 1).\n\nThe current shop shows Campfire (x1), The Sun (Heart conversion), and Neptune (Straight Flush). I'm not interested in Neptune right now. Campfire has potential, scaling by selling cards, but I already have a full Joker board, and I need to be cautious with my existing strategy. The Sun is tempting for thinning the deck and making Flushes easier, but I also need to think about Perkeo's effect.\n\nPerkeo is going to copy a consumable at the end of the shop. I *must* keep my Jupiter to guarantee the copy. If I find another Jupiter in the shop, I need to buy it immediately. My primary goal is to scale my Flush level, and Jupiters are key. The Campfire seems like a risky gamble at this point, requiring card selling to scale.\n\nLet's do the math: the shop reroll costs $7. I'm keeping my eyes peeled for Jupiter or useful vouchers. I can reroll, and I still have plenty of money.\n\nI'm focused on Jupiters. If I buy The Sun for $2, and Perkeo clones it, then I won't get the Jupiter copy. No, I need to stay disciplined and avoid buying *anything* else.\n\nI'm starting to think about The Flint: 140 base chips / 2 = 70 chips, and 18 base mult / 2 = 9 mult. My Stuntman gives 250 chips, so I'm looking at 320 chips with my existing setup. My multipliers from the Jokers will be 9 + 10 * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 19 * 6 = 114 mult. With my hand score with my current setup, it will be 320 * 114 = 36,480.\n\nA typical Ante 7 Blind is ~50k-60k. The Flint is going to be 100k+, and I won't get there with 36k. A previous Ante 7 Blind gives me 71k, and the last big blind gives me 59k. The Flint is going to half both.\n\nI need scaling! I could try Campfire, but it requires selling. I could level my hand, and each Jupiter adds +15 chips and +2 mult, which is strong. The Jupiter + Perkeo strategy is a long-term play.\n\nI need Jupiters! Reroll.\n\nOne final check. Should I use Jupiter? NO! Perkeo triggers at the end of the shop; I must have it in inventory for the copy.\n\nFinal decision: Reroll the shop to find more Jupiters.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"reroll_shop\"}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
