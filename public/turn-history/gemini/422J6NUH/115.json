{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Maximizing My Club Flush Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: it's SHOP phase (Ante 5, Round 11). I've got $61, five Jokers in play, and a very specific Club Flush-focused strategy. My primary goal is to leverage that \"The Moon\" consumable with Perkeo to consistently get Clubs.\n\nMy current Jokers are: Gros Michel (+15 Mult, with a chance to break), Egg ($31 sell value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Polychrome), Perkeo (duplicates a consumable), and Blue Joker (+92 Chips). I have one consumable, \"The Moon\" which converts three cards to Clubs. I have a Loyalty Card ($4) and The Star ($2) in the shop, as well as several vouchers (Overstock, Clearance Sale, Reroll Surplus) I can use. The reroll cost is $6, which I can absolutely afford.\n\nThe key is Perkeo. I need \"The Moon\" to be the *only* consumable when I leave the shop so I'm guaranteed to duplicate it. So, I need to be careful.\n\nLet's look at the options. The Loyalty Card is tempting with its x4 Mult, every 6 hands but requires me to sell one of my strong Jokers (Gros Michel or Blue Joker). The Star is a definite no-go; it's Diamonds, which goes against my Club build. Rerolling the shop seems the best option at this stage and I am not seeing any good plays so far. I have plenty of money.\n\nI want to keep \"The Moon\". I *need* to keep \"The Moon\" because that is the entire strategy here.\n\nTherefore: Reroll.\n\nRight, `reroll_shop` it is. The reroll cost is $6, leaving me with $55. Valid move. No other actions are clearly better at this point. I've already used Pluto.\n\nWait, looking at the previous turns:\nTurn 113: Reroll ($4)\nTurn 114: Reroll ($5)\nTurn 115: Buy/Use Pluto ($2)\nCurrent (Turn 116): Money is $61. Reroll is $6.\n\nLet's do one more reroll to look for Jupiter or a better Joker.\n\nWait, I should check if there are any Booster Packs. There are none listed (\"Shop Boosters: None\").\n\nSo, given all of this analysis, I'm going to commit to `reroll_shop` again, hoping for a better Joker or a Planet card to supercharge my Club Flush synergy.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
