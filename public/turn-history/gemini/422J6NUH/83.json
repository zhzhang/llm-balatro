{"reasoning":"**My Plan for This Round**\n\nOkay, Ante 4, Round 9. I'm in the Shop phase after the Small Blind with $37. My build is Flush-focused, so that's what I want to maximize. I have some good Jokers already: Gros Michel (+15 mult), Egg ($25 sell value), Droll Joker (+10 mult on Flush, x1.5 Polychrome), Perkeo (negative consumable copy), and Crafty Joker (+80 chips on Flush). I also have two \"The Moon\" consumables.\n\nIn the shop, I see Business Card, Blue Joker, Jumbo Standard Pack, Celestial Pack, and Magic Trick. I'm not prioritizing Business Card or Magic Trick right now. My Flush is level 4 (80 chips, 10 mult), and the next Blind is a big jump at 7500 chips, so I need to build up.\n\nThe Celestial Pack is the priority, aiming for Jupiter to level up my Flush. I'll buy that first. Then, I will buy the Jumbo Standard Pack to look for Clubs or useful enhancements. I have enough money to shop effectively.\n\nPerkeo will generate a negative copy of a consumable at the end of the shop. I need to keep at least one \"The Moon\" so that Perkeo can copy it.\n\nSelling Egg would give me $25, but I don't need the money urgently unless a very good Joker shows up.\n\nThe Blue Joker looks tempting at +90 chips, and it would give a lot of value immediately. But I already have Crafty Joker, which gives +80 chips on Flushes, and my deck is getting thinner? Wait, +2 chips for each remaining card in deck (currently 45?). It seems that 45 * 2 = 90. It's a decent chip joker, but I already have Crafty Joker. My Flush build gives me a more consistent approach. Blue Joker's value will decline as I play cards, so I think Crafty is better overall.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1.  Buy the Celestial Pack ($3) - Hoping for Jupiter.\n2.  Buy the Jumbo Standard Pack ($4).\n3.  I'll skip rerolling and not replace Crafty Joker with Blue Joker.\n\nSo the plan is to `buy_booster` at position `2`. I'll double check the positions, as it should be an array `[2]`.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
