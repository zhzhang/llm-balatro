{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 9, Ante 4, and I'm in the SHOP phase. My primary objective is to maximize my Flush strategy. I have $34 in the bank. My inventory looks like this: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($25 sell value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult/x1.5 Mult on Flush), Perkeo (Legendary, copies consumables), and Crafty Joker (+80 Chips on Flush). I'm also holding two copies of \"The Moon\" (Negative). I just picked up Neptune from the Celestial Pack last turn.\n\nIn the shop right now, I see a Business Card ($3), Blue Joker ($4, +90 chips), a Jumbo Standard Pack ($4), and a Magic Trick Voucher ($7). I have a Flush at Level 4 (80/10) and a Straight Flush at Level 2 (140/12).\n\nThe last turn involved a Celestial Pack followed by a Jumbo Standard Pack buy, for $4. My immediate thought is to evaluate the Blue Joker. It's +90 chips, while Crafty Joker only gives +80 on Flush, but I have Perkeo and \"The Moon\", and Flushes are my focus. Blue Joker is a bit better generically, but I'm almost *always* playing Flushes. If I buy Blue Joker I need to sell something. Egg gives $25. Gros Michel may break soon.\n\nWait. The Jumbo Standard Pack is still there.\n\nThe smart move here is to buy that Jumbo Standard Pack. It costs $4, leaving me with $30. I want to hold onto \"The Moon\" to let Perkeo copy them during shop phase. Blue Joker is generically a little better at +90 chips, vs. Crafty at +80, but I don't want to sell Egg unless I have to. The Jumbo Standard Pack is the better buy for now.\n\nSo, the action is `buy_booster 1`, and the command to buy the booster pack is `buy_booster 1`. No need to buy Blue Joker first since the booster *could* contain something better, even if it's unlikely for immediate scoring, it might be a key card enhancement. Specifically, this is a \"Jumbo Standard Pack\", which means I choose 1 of up to 5 cards.\n\nThe full Shop setup is: Shop Cards: 1 (Business Card), 2 (Blue Joker), Shop Boosters: 1 (Jumbo Standard Pack), Shop Vouchers: 1 (Magic Trick).\n\nSo the decision is: `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
