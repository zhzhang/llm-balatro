{"reasoning":"**Flush Analysis and Play Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante of 7, round 18, and I'm on the big blind. I need a whopping 52,500 chips to advance, and I'm currently at zero. I have 4 hands left, 5 discards, and $68. My hand is: King of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, and 3 of Clubs. Looks like a flush is on the table, and it's looking promising!\n\nI've got some good Jokers in play: Droll Joker adds +10 Multiplier if I get a flush and also gives x1.5 Mult, Ramen, a straight x2 Multiplier (no discards, so that's the full effect), The Tribe, also x2 Mult if flush, Perkeo which is a shop consumable duplicator, and Stuntman for a flat +250 chips at the cost of -2 hand size.\n\nI'm aiming for a Flush, which is at level 8, giving me a base of 140 chips and an 18 multiplier. The clubs are in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Calculating the card chips: 9 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 34. Adding Stuntman's bonus: 140 + 34 + 250 = 424 chips. The base multiplier is 18. Droll Joker gives me an additional +10, bringing the multiplier to 28. Then, I have the multiplicative modifiers: Droll's x1.5, Ramen's x2, and The Tribe's x2, resulting in 28 * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 168. So, the total score would be 424 * 168 = 71,232.\n\nMy target is 52,500, and my estimated score from this hand is 71,232. Looks like a guaranteed win for this round with a single hand! I can also buy a consumable with Perkeo to duplicate it in the shop to add some long term value.\n\nSo, I'm going to *play* the flush with the five clubs in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Estimated chips: 71,232.\n\nI triple-checked the calculations, everything seems spot on. The Joker order is optimal: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe. My money situation is good for the upcoming shop. Perkeo can be triggered after the shop. So, there's a play!\n\nNow, just to be absolutely sure, I'll confirm:\n\n`{\"action\": \"play\", \"positions\": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\", \"estimated_chips\": 71232}`\n\nIt's all good. Now, let's win this round!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
