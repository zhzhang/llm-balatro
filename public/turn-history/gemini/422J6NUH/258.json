{"reasoning":"**My Shop Strategy: Maximizing Perkeo for Flush Dominance**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, Round 20, Shop phase. I've got $38 and a pretty solid joker lineup: Droll, Ramen x2, The Tribe, and Stuntman. My hand strength is centered on Flushes, level 12 currently. The key to this round, and honestly my overall strategy, revolves around Perkeo, the Legendary joker.\n\nThe problem? Perkeo needs a consumable to duplicate at the end of the shop, and I have none. I *need* to acquire one this shop. The shop has Saturn (Straight), Clever Joker, Venus (Three of a Kind), and Crafty Joker.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are, should I just buy a planet card and be done with it? Saturn or Venus would give me something for Perkeo to target every round, even if they aren't ideal for a Flush build. These are essentially \"consumable-type\" cards since I can *buy_card* to put them in my consumables inventory. But ideally, I want a Jupiter, because that would be huge for the Flush strategy.\n\nRerolling is an option, thanks to my vouchers. I've got \"Reroll Surplus\" so I pay $3, not too bad. Given my $38, I can comfortably reroll a few times. Option A: Buy Saturn. Option B: Reroll for Jupiter. Option C: Sell a joker, but I don't think it's necessary. I don't think I'll sell a joker.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'm going to commit to this Perkeo strategy. I'm going to prioritize getting *any* consumable card. I'll spend the $3 to reroll. If Jupiter shows up, I buy it. Otherwise, I'll take whatever planet card is offered. I'm going to reroll the shop once. Then, I'll re-evaluate the shop contents. Let's see what the shop gods offer. Action: Reroll.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
