{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop: Immolate is the Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 7, $61 in the bank, Spectral Pack in the shop. I'm running a Flush strategy, specifically focusing on Clubs, and I've got a strong engine brewing with The Moon and Perkeo. Thinning the deck is key here, and Immolate seems perfectly positioned to help.\n\nThe first option, Familiar, is decent. Three enhanced face cards are okay, but I'm not running any joker synergies that key off face cards, and it risks hitting important cards. My hand size is already 8.\n\nImmolate, however, is a clear winner. Destroying 5 random cards *directly* supports my Club strategy by increasing the likelihood of drawing Clubs. Plus, the immediate $20 boost (taking me to $81) is invaluable for maintaining interest and buying the Mega Arcana pack in the next shop. I also have the Seltzer to consider. The Egg is also growing.\n\nI'm checking the command syntax for pack selections. The description says Immolate chooses \"random\" cards to be destroyed, and this command doesn't require card selection: `select <pack_card_position>`. This is just to confirm my expectation for the UI.\n\nI'm confident in Immolate. It’s better than the random face cards of Familiar. The $20 is also far more valuable.\n\nMy final thought is: **Select Immolate (position 2).**\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
