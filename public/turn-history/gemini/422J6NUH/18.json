{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy for Ante 2**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop phase of Ante 2 with $15. I've got a solid base going with Gros Michel, Egg, and The Chariot already in play. The goal is to optimize the build for the long run. I'm presented with a few interesting options here. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the shop. There's 'The Fool', which looks like it will give me another 'The Hierophant', which is excellent for Bonus card enhancement. Then, a 'Greedy Joker', which isn't essential for my current build and is conditional. I also see two 'Jumbo Celestial Packs', which is tempting for hand scaling and will further improve my hands. The critical item, though, is 'Clearance Sale' voucher. It reduces shop costs, and that's an incredible long-term investment.\n\nLet's break down the options. Option A is buying 'Clearance Sale' immediately. That leaves $5, meaning I can't buy anything else. Option B, buying 'The Fool' and using it is a good play, getting me the bonus cards. That leaves $12. Option C is the Celestial Pack. Then, Option D, buying 'Greedy Joker'.\n\nOkay, 'Clearance Sale' is the best long-term play, but I'm going to have to make the most of what's available. Buying the voucher immediately is the first move. If I do that, the cost of 'The Fool' will drop, so I can also get that.\n\nLet's check the schema. Ah, the \"buy_voucher\" command takes a voucher position as a single parameter. So it's \"buy_voucher <voucher_position>\". The voucher is in position 1. And that action is the one that sets the wheels in motion.\n\nSo, the play is clear. Buy the voucher. It reduces all shop costs, and then I can leverage that to improve my current board, now and into the future. That makes the most of my current cash on hand. I'm going to commit to this play: Buy the 'Clearance Sale' voucher. Now, with the voucher in hand, I can focus on scaling up the hands. Let's execute the order: `buy_voucher 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
