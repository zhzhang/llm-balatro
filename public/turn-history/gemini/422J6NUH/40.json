{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment and Resource Management**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 3, Round 5. Just finished off the Ante 2 boss, feeling good. I have $6, which isn’t ideal, but I've got a solid Joker lineup: Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and Delayed Gratification. No consumables, which is the immediate problem, as I *really* want to activate Perkeo. I just rerolled once, no luck. Currently, the shop has Throwback, Ride the Bus, Buffoon Pack, Reroll Surplus, and Reroll Cost.\n\nMy goal is to get a consumable in the shop to Perkeo's effect, but I have no consumables in my inventory. Right now, I'm at a crossroads. I’m thinking through my options very carefully.\n\nOption 1: Reroll. Reroll might give me a consumable to buy for Perkeo, but it will cost $6, leaving me with nothing. Clearance Sale makes things cheaper but I'd still be broke. Selling Egg is an option if I find something good, but that’s a big sacrifice.\n\nOption 2: Buy the Buffoon Pack. The Buffoon Pack for $3. A Buffoon Pack *might* get me a better Joker, but that doesn't solve the Perkeo problem. I'm already pretty happy with my Jokers.\n\nOption 3: Buy Throwback or Ride the Bus. Neither is a consumable, and the Joker slots are full. Not really worth it.\n\nOption 4: Exit the shop. This is the least risky. It saves $6 for interest and future shops, and I can play this next round to build my money, especially given the \"Delayed Gratification\".\n\nPerkeo is my key card. A single trigger of Perkeo with a good card is huge. But the shop is empty. The shop has zero consumables currently. I need a consumable, and the shop isn't offering.\n\nIf I reroll, I'm broke. I could sell Egg ($13), but that's a lot to pay for a gamble. So many thoughts are running through my head. Should I spend it all? Is there another way to get a consumable? No. It's not worth spending $6 on a reroll when I have $6.\n\nLet's re-assess my Jokers: Gros Michel is crucial (+15 Mult), Egg generates value, Droll Joker is strong (x1.5 and +10 for Flush), Perkeo is the core strategy, and Delayed Gratification generates money. I think I'm overthinking this.\n\nIf I reroll and find nothing, I'm broke. The Buffoon Pack isn't an immediate solution. The immediate move would be to *not* reroll. If I `round_select` and save my money, then I miss one chance for Perkeo to trigger. Given that I have a Flush and Droll, I think I'm relatively safe for now.\n\nWait, if I just play the round, I can win some money. With winning the round + interest + Delayed Gratification discards I could get around $15. That is more money. At $15, I can afford to reroll and buy things in the next shop.\n\nThrowback and Ride the Bus aren't strong enough. Not worth it.\n\nSo, here’s the conclusion: Trying to force Perkeo right now with only $6 and a $6 reroll cost is too risky. I'm just going to save the money, get the interest and discard bonus, and try again next shop with a better economy.\n\nOne thing to note: Perkeo activates at the *end* of the shop, when I start the round. Any reason to rearrange Jokers? Let's check: Yes, the order is:\n1: Gros Michel\n2: Egg\n3: Droll\n4: Perkeo\n5: Delayed Gratification.\n\nI should put the additive effects of Gros Michel and Droll before the multiplier. The current Joker arrangement is correct. It will result in (Base + 15 + 10) * 1.5. This will maximize the multiplier.\n\nCheck for any other action. No, just `buy_booster 1`. But my joker slots are full and I do not want to sell anything.\n\nDecision time: I am going to proceed to `round_select` to build my economy.\n\nDouble-checking the \"Clearance Sale\" voucher again. All shop cards and packs are 25% off. I am going to *not* reroll and be patient.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have no consumables. I cannot buy the voucher. I can't be impatient and force a bad\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
