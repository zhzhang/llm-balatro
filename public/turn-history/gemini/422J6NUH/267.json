{"reasoning":"**Shop Reroll Strategy: Final Ante Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 20, the shop phase. I've got $29 and the reroll cost is $7. My goal is simple: maximize my score for the final Boss Blind.\n\nMy current hand is heavily focused on a Flush build, currently level 12 with 200 chips and 26 multiplier. I’m running:\n\n1.  **The Tribe:** (X2 Multiplier for Flush)\n2.  **Droll Joker:** (+10 Multiplier for Flush, X1.5 Polychrome Multiplier)\n3.  **Ramen:** (X2 Multiplier, decreasing)\n4.  **Stuntman:** (+250 Chips, -2 hand size - which is a current downside.)\n5.  **Brainstorm:** (Copies the leftmost: The Tribe)\n\nMy *rough* Flush calculation is: ~500 Chips (200 Base + Stuntman + Cards) and a 36 Multiplier (26 Base + 10 Droll). The X Multiplier is: Tribe (X2) * Brainstorm (X2) * Droll (X1.5) * Ramen (X2) = X12. So the total is ~500 * 36 * 12 = 216,000. Not bad. Previously, a similar hand went for 87,552 chips, but this has the potential for more. It looks like the same calculation, the *Correction* in Turn 265 shows this (26+10)*1.5*2*2*2 = 432 Multiplier. 500 * 432 = 216,000.\n\nLooking at the current shop cards, Merry Andy is out – the -1 hand size is terrible with Stuntman's -2. Shoot the Moon is irrelevant for a flush build. Wily Joker, same story.\n\n**Therefore, I need to reroll.** I'm going to spend the $7 to get a new shop. I'm searching for:\n\n*   **Jupiter:** The Planet card would level up my Flush.\n*   **Good Tarot Cards:** The Hermit, Death, The Hanged Man, any of those would be very useful.\n*   **Spectral Cards:** Any Spectral card is welcome for the scaling potential\n\nSelling Judgment isn’t even a consideration right now, this build is very powerful. I'll reroll the shop to search for what I need to make the boss blind simple.\n\nSo, the action is: `reroll_shop`, and then proceed to the next round. Rerolling is the most proactive way to get the best score.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
