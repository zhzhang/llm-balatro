{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Selection After Jumbo Celestial Pack**\n\nOkay, here we are in the `PLANET_PACK` game step. I've just bought a Jumbo Celestial Pack and it's time to make a decision. Five planet cards are on the table: Pluto, Mars, Neptune, Mercury, and Jupiter. Time to analyze.\n\nLet's break down the options. Pluto's a simple +10 chips and +1 mult – it's alright. Mercury offers a Pair for +15 chips, +1 Mult. I know from experience that Flushes are relatively consistent with a standard deck. The real standouts here are Mars (Four of a Kind) and Neptune (Straight Flush), but those are rare hands, so they're probably not the best choice now. I've played a Flush before and the scaling is pretty good at its current level. Three-of-a-Kind, my most played hand, isn't on the table.\n\nNow, considering the Jokers I have: Gros Michel adds +15 Mult and Egg which I can sell for $7. Gros Michel is the key. Since it provides a lot of flat mult, I need to focus on a hand that has a decent base chips/mult.\n\nComparing the available options, Jupiter (Flush) stands out. Let's compare Mercury (Pair) vs Jupiter (Flush): With Mercury, the Pair goes to 25 chips, 3 Mult. With Jupiter, a Flush hits 50 chips, 6 Mult. Given that I have a flat Mult booster in play, I'm thinking a high base hand is optimal. The math is clear: the Flush is the better target for scaling.\n\nSo, I'm going with Jupiter. It’s the most consistent scoring boost and fits my strategy perfectly.\n\nAction: select 5\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
