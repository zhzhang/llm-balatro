{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Final Ante Shop**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. It's Ante 8, the final one, and I need to squeeze every last point out of this run. I've got $45, a solid Flush build at level 10, and a Perkeo Joker that copies a consumable *at the end of the shop*. Mercury is my current consumable. My objective is to get the highest score possible.\n\nI'm thinking step-by-step. First, that Arcana Pack at $3 is a no-brainer. It could give me a better consumable or maybe even a game-changing Tarot card. I've got to maximize my chances now.\n\nThe main objective is to use Perkeo's power effectively. Mercury is okay, but if I can get a more powerful consumable from the Arcana pack, then Perkeo can copy it. Plus, even if I get a bad Tarot, Perkeo gives me a consumable slot so I can discard.\n\nLet's break it down: Buy the Arcana Pack. If it gives a Tarot, use it immediately because I don't have space to keep it. *Then*, consider whether to buy Overstock Plus to get more cards on future rerolls. *Then*, reroll the shop, aiming for Jupiter (for a flush build).\n\nSo, first command: `buy_booster 1` (Arcana Pack).\n\nBefore I commit, I need to make sure my jokers are properly optimized. Droll gives +10 mult and 1.5x mult, Ramen is a 2x mult, The Tribe is 2x mult, Perkeo is a consumable slot holder, and Stuntman gives +250 chips. Chips and Mult are separate. Stuntman's position in the lineup doesn't affect its calculation timing. +Mult happens before all xMult, and xMult happens in the order they are in. I need to keep in mind Joker triggers and the correct order of operations. Droll's +10 is additive, so if I got another additive joker I'd need to change position. This is a very optimal setup, at this stage of the game.\n\nWith the Arcana pack bought I need to make sure I am doing the correct action.\n\nAction: `buy_booster`\nPosition: `1`\n\nThe goal is still to get a great consumable for Perkeo. No time to waste. Arcana pack, here I come!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
