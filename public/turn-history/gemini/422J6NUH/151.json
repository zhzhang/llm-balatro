{"reasoning":"**My Strategy for \"The Mark\" Boss Blind: Flush and Discard**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, Round 14, and I need to get 22,000 chips. I'm currently at 10,080, so I need 11,920 more with only 3 hands left. The \"Mark\" boss flips cards face down *after* each hand, but crucially, discards don't flip cards.\n\nI have some powerful Jokers: Gros Michel for Mult, Egg (sell value), Droll (more Mult for Flush), Perkeo (negative consumables), and a Blue Joker for chips. I have two \"Moon\" consumables, good for turning cards into clubs, and Flush is at level 4. The current hand is a possible Club Flush (King, Queen, 6, 3, 3) which is worth a solid 8,925 chips, with the Droll Joker's Polychrome edition giving a x1.5 modifier.\n\nOriginally, I thought of using \"The Moon\" to improve the Flush further, converting the Diamonds to Clubs. But then I realized, this first hand with the Flush has to be played. The next hand is going to be partially face-down. So, the right strategy is to play the flush hand (for 8,925 chips), discard to fish for good cards on the next hand, then play the next hand, and so on.\n\nHowever, I have 3 discards and 3 hands. I can't win in 1 hand (need 11.9k, max is ~10k), and the second hand will likely have face-down cards. The strategy is now clear: Play a Flush now to take advantage of the current cards. Then, for the next hand, if cards are face down, use \"The Moon\" or discards to find the next Flush. The Blue Joker is going to get weaker as the deck gets smaller, so it's a priority to use it now.\n\nCalculating: Playing the Club Flush (King, Queen, 6, 3, 3), that's 80 (Flush Lvl 4) + 58 (Blue) + 32 (card total) = 170 chips, multiplied by (10 + 15 + 10) * 1.5 = 52.5 mult, for a total of 8,925 chips. That's a solid start.\n\nThe real key here is maximizing what I can do with discards, given the face-down card mechanic. So, I will play the Flush, bank those chips, then focus on improving the second hand using my remaining discards and \"The Moon\" consumable, if needed. Then I can make sure I have enough chips to get through the boss.\n\nSo, the play is to use my current Flush hand.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
