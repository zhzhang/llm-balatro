{"reasoning":"**Action Summary: Sell Blue Joker for Stuntman**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thought process. The user wants me to choose the *next* move in Balatro. Currently, I'm staring at the shop, Ante 7, Round 16, with $97 in the bank. I've got a decent setup with my Jokers (Blue, Droll, Ramen, Tribe, Perkeo) and a Jupiter consumable ready to go. The most immediate concern is maximizing the value of Perkeo for future rounds by ensuring it has a consumable to copy.\n\nLooking at the shop, the obvious play is **Stuntman**, which gives a hefty +250 Chips, replacing my current +94 chip joker (Blue). I need to sell the Blue Joker to buy it. This seems like an easy call with my heavily club-dominated deck. I also need to keep Jupiter, so Perkeo has something to copy.\n\nI'm also considering the other shop items: The Devil (meh for now), Golden Ticket (not a priority), Arcana Pack, Spectral Pack, and Wasteful Voucher. The packs are tempting for deck improvement, and the Wasteful Voucher could provide some flexibility. But Stuntman is the immediate, game-changing move. There's plenty of money, and I could buy everything, but I'll focus on the high-impact plays first.\n\nI need to decide the action to take. The prompt says I must only do one thing per turn.\n\nThe key action is to replace Blue Joker.\n\nLet's do this: Sell Blue Joker and buy Stuntman. Sell Blue Joker.\n\nAction: `sell_joker`, `positions`: `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
