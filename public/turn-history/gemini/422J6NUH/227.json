{"reasoning":"**Prioritizing Flush Scaling Against The Flint**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 7, facing The Flint, which halves my base chips and multiplier. My immediate goal is to scale up my Flush to compensate. I've got $69, and my key Jokers are Droll (Flush mult and polychrome bonus), Ramen (mult), The Tribe (Flush mult), Perkeo (legendary, copy consumable - essential for scaling), and Stuntman (base chips - also essential). My current Flush is level 8, giving 140 chips and 18 mult.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see Hanging Chad ($3), Jupiter ($2), and Earth ($2). Jupiter is the immediate priority. I need to get Perkeo to copy Jupiter to get those Flush levels. The Hanged Man, my only consumable currently, is good for deck thinning, but scaling Flush is *much* more important right now.\n\nI realize I'm in the SHOP step, so I *can't* use The Hanged Man immediately, even if I wanted to. I need to *buy* something. Now, if I buy Jupiter, Perkeo has a 50/50 chance to copy either that, or the Hanged Man. It's a risk. I need that Jupiter to be copied. The best way to guarantee a Jupiter copy is to sell the Hanged Man *first*, then buy Jupiter. However, I have enough money that I can *buy* Jupiter first, then decide. Let's do that! Then I can sell the Hanged Man, if I want to guarantee the copy.\n\nHanging Chad is tempting for retriggering with Stuntman, but I don't need it. I have solid base chip and mult multipliers via the jokers I already have. No need to sell a joker for Hanging Chad.\n\nSo, the plan: `buy_card 2` (Jupiter). I need to level up that Flush *now*. My current action is to buy Jupiter, and then make a decision about selling the Hanged Man to guarantee the Jupiter copy from Perkeo. That ensures consistent scaling.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
