{"reasoning":"**Current Evaluation: Ante 2, Round 3 - Shop Phase**\n\nAlright, let's take stock of the situation. Ante 2, Round 3. I've got nothing in the bank – $0, but I have a level 3 Flush (65 chips, 8 mult) and Gros Michel (+15 mult, with that risky break chance) and a scaling Egg ($7 sell value, increasing each round by $3). There's nothing in my inventory, which is a pity.\n\nThe shop itself isn't *terrible*. I'm presented with Greedy Joker for $4 and a Jumbo Celestial Pack also for $4.  I also have a Clearance Sale Voucher. This round is really not the place for that, as I have nothing to spend it on. I can sell the Egg for $7 or Gros Michel for $2.\n\nI can't afford anything directly, obviously, given my zero dollar balance. My first impulse is to think about cashing in that Egg. If I sold it I could get the Jumbo Celestial Pack. It's tempting, but then I remember the Egg is a solid investment. It's only Ante 2, and the Egg's value is going to continue to grow, gaining $3 each round.  I don't *need* the extra power right now.\n\nGreedy Joker is not worth it, even if I could afford it after selling the Egg. My deck isn't optimized for Diamonds, so the Gros Michel is better. With a level 3 Flush and Gros Michel, I'm confident I can handle the coming round.  No point in selling the Egg just to get a Joker that won't scale with me, given the present conditions.\n\nMy analysis boils down to this: *Don't change a winning hand*. I'll hold onto the Egg, advance to the next round, and hope I find something better next time. The logical action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
