{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Reroll the Shop**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 5, Round 11. I'm sitting on $77, which is plenty – interest isn't a concern. My inventory is looking pretty solid: Gros Michel (+15 Mult, potential downside), Egg (cash generator), Droll Joker (a solid multiplier), Perkeo (Legendary consumable duplicator!), and a Blue Joker (+92 Chips). I've got \"The Moon\" which will allow me to convert cards to clubs. Flush is my hand of choice, level 4, and I need to optimize for score/survival.\n\nI've already analyzed the shop items. Banner isn't going to cut it; Blue Joker already covers the chip generation. Red Card is useless, since I already skipped the booster. My Perkeo will trigger *after* the shop ends. The Moon is the right pick.\n\nMy current Mult: 10 (base) + 15 (Gros Michel) + 10 (Droll) = 35, times 1.5 (Droll) = 52.5. Times another 1.5 (Polychrome) = 78.75. My Chips: 80 (base) + 92 (Blue Joker) = 172. My approximate score per Flush is 13,545. Two Flushes would comfortably clear Ante 5.\n\nSo, the play is to use my funds to my advantage: I have plenty of money. I can afford a few rerolls to look for Jupiter or better Jokers. I *should* keep \"The Moon\" so Perkeo copies it. Selling cards won't help, so I'll go for the reroll.\n\n**Therefore, the action is `reroll_shop`.**\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
