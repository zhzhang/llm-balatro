{"reasoning":"**The Optimization Dance: Blind Select, Round 21, and the Quest for Multiplier Supremacy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 8/8, Blind Select (Boss), needing 100,000 chips. I have $6 and five Jokers: The Tribe, Droll Joker (Polychrome), Ramen, Stuntman, and Brainstorm. The goal is to maximize the Flush multiplier. Flush is at Level 13, giving 215 base chips and 28 mult. The ideal is to play a Flush and get the highest possible multiplier.\n\nInitially, I had Tribe in the first position, Droll second, Ramen third, Stuntman fourth, and Brainstorm fifth. Brainstorm copies the leftmost Joker, which was Tribe, giving a x2. I calculated a total score of 205,920.\n\nThen, I started to play with it, pondering if Droll Joker was leftmost or if I put Droll first, then Brainstorm. This didn't seem better. Then, there was a point where I realized that Brainstorm *copies the ability* not the edition. And there was a bunch of re-evaluation of putting Droll in a better place for multiplier. Then, I realized the order of operations for Jokers is left-to-right. I realized I was missing the \" + \" then \" x \" effect of Droll.\n\nI keep coming back to the question: How to best arrange these Jokers? I need to get the \" +10\" from Droll Joker to apply *before* the other multipliers. Should Brainstorm copy Tribe (x2) or Droll (+10) since I want the +10 before the x-multipliers? I want Droll to be in an early position, to get its \"+10\" before the other multipliers trigger. Brainstorm should copy the most effective multiplier.\n\nAfter some trial and error, a key realization struck: I need to prioritize the \"+10\" from Droll before the x2 multipliers. The ideal scenario: Droll's \"+10\" triggers, then the x2 multipliers kick in. This could lead to a very large multiplier.\n\nI reconsidered whether the previous command, *play\\_round*, actually went through. I'm stuck at `BLIND_SELECT`, which is making me double-check the command was received.\n\nLet me think this through once more: Tribe copies from left to right. I think the absolute best setup is: **Tribe, Droll, Ramen, Brainstorm (copying Tribe), Stuntman**.\n\nNow, should I use the consumable The Chariot? Yes! I am in the round and can use it. I'll enter the round with the final lineup of Jokers.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
