{"reasoning":"**Flush Build Optimization - Ante 7, Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm on Ante 7, Round 18, and staring down \"The Flint\" boss, which halves base chips and multipliers. My primary strategy is a Flush build, and I've got a decent foundation: a Level 8 Flush, the Droll Joker (Polychrome, Flush mult), Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, and Stuntman. I also have a Jupiter consumable (Lvl 8 Flush) that is key to my strategy.\n\nMy initial thought is that I need to maximize that Flush level *before* the boss hits, because those halved base values are going to kill my score. My current $59 bankroll gives me enough wiggle room, especially since the interest cap is $25, so I can comfortably reroll the shop without hurting myself too much.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Scholar, Hallucination, and Mercury cards are useless. I have to find a better shop. I'm going to **reroll the shop** immediately. The ideal scenario is another Jupiter. But I have to be smart about it: I must keep one Jupiter in my inventory to have it copied by Perkeo at the shop's end. This is absolutely critical; getting an extra free Jupiter for my flush is perfect. If I *do* find another Jupiter, I should buy and use it immediately so that I can keep the original one for Perkeo.\n\nI'm focused on the long game here: Increasing the Flush level as much as possible before the boss, which means focusing on Jupiter and nothing else right now. I'm confident I have a good amount of money to get what I need.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
