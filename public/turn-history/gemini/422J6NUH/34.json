{"reasoning":"**Balatro Round Analysis: Ante 2, Round 4 (Boss Blind Incoming)**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in a tight spot. Money is incredibly low at just $1, and the Boss Blind is looming. My immediate goal is to maximize scoring and maintain a healthy economy, but I'm currently hamstrung.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup: Gros Michel, Egg (growing value), Droll Joker, Perkeo (the key to a *massive* power spike, if I can just get it going), and Delayed Gratification. Perkeo's ability to create a Negative copy of a consumable is what I'm *really* after. But the trigger is at the end of the shop, I *must* have a consumable.\n\nThe shop offers a Standard Pack, and a reroll. With my current cash, neither are within reach. I have two obvious options to secure cash: Sell the Gros Michel or sell the Egg.\n\nMy first thought was to sell the Gros Michel ($2), grab a Standard Pack. Doesn't trigger Perkeo though. Doesn't offer a path to a consumable. Nope.\n\nThat leaves the Egg. Selling the Egg would give me $11. I could reroll the shop ($5), potentially finding a Planet or Tarot consumable ($3 with clearance), giving Perkeo something to copy. It's high-risk, high-reward. However, the Egg grows by $3 per shop, so selling it means forfeiting its natural growth for an uncertain outcome.\n\nOr I could just leave. Taking the blind, and hoping that I can find a consumable in the next shop. My last hand was a Flush that put up 3197. The blinds usually require 2200-3000 to win, so it's a good bet. Plus, I don't discard, to take advantage of Delayed Gratification.\n\n*What if I reroll?* If I reroll, it's a gamble. I could find a consumable, but I might *not* find anything. Is the payoff from Perkeo *guaranteed* to be better than the Egg's passive growth?\n\nI've got a Voucher. Clearance Sale. 25% off everything. Still useless. Money's too tight.\n\nI could have a shot at $15-20 in the next shop if I win this Blind.\n\n*Wait!* I did buy Delayed Gratification last round. My immediate actions are limited. I only have $1. I cannot buy anything in the shop.\n\nThe optimal Joker order: Gros Michel, Droll, Egg, Perkeo, Delayed Gratification. The scoring math checks out, too. Gros Michel and Droll synergize perfectly.\n\nI'm playing it safe. Moving to the round.\n\n**Decision: Proceed to round_select.** I'll face the Boss Blind without the consumable gamble. I'll maintain my economic base with the Egg. I'll check the shop in the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
