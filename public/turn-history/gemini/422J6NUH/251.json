{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization for Final Ante**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for this final ante, Round 19. I'm currently the small blind, which is 50,000 chips. My hand setup is geared towards Flushes and Straight Flushes, and I'm sitting on a solid foundation. I have a Droll Joker (+10 Mult if Flush, X1.5 Mult), Ramen (X2 Mult, loses X0.01 per discard), The Tribe (X2 Mult if Flush), Perkeo (Duplicate consumable at end of shop), and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size).\n\nThe key here is maximizing my score for the final stretch. My flush level is 10, and straight flush is already at level 7. My current goal is to use the Neptune to bring the Straight Flush to level 8. I have one Neptune consumable left.\n\nFirst, I need to execute my final Neptune use. This gets my Straight Flush to level 8.\n\nNext, I need to decide between playing the round or skipping the round. Skipping grants a \"Charm Tag\" (Mega Arcana Pack), while playing gives me a $3 reward, interest, and hand money. The Small Blind is 50,000. Considering my Jokers (Droll, Ramen, The Tribe) and current levels, especially after the Straight Flush upgrade, hitting 50,000 is trivial.\n\nHowever, since I have Perkeo, going to the shop is key. Skipping keeps me in the Blind Select, no shop! But beating the round moves me to the shop and allows me to duplicate consumables with Perkeo, and the duplicated Neptune is an excellent boon.\n\nTherefore, the optimized play is to use my final Neptune, then *play* this round. Let's get to the shop!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
