{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Blind and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 17, Blind Select phase. The Big Blind is up, requiring 52,500 chips, and I have $68. My hand is a Flush at level 6, currently at 110 chips and 14 multiplier. I have two Jupiter cards, which I should use now to get the best value from the hand. The next blind is \"The Flint\", a Boss Blind where base chips and multiplier are halved, and the Ethereal tag is tempting, but skipping means I miss out on shop, which is very important.\n\nMy Jokers are: Droll (+10 Mult if Flush, x1.5 Mult), Ramen (x2 Mult, decaying), The Tribe (x2 Mult if Flush), Perkeo (Negative copy), and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size).\n\nThe key is to leverage the Jupiter cards. Using both will boost my Flush to Level 8 (140 chips, 18 Mult).\n\nIf I play the Big Blind with current level 6:\n*   I have a base score of 110 chips and 14 mult.\n*   I can add 250 chips via Stuntman, and 10 mult via Droll.\n*   My Multipliers are x1.5 (Droll) * x2 (Ramen) * x2 (Tribe) = x6.\n*   The total is 360 * (24 * 6) = 51,840.\n\nIf I play the Big Blind with level 8:\n*   Boss Blind (The Flint): 70 Chips / 9 Mult.\n*   With Stuntman: 320 Chips.\n*   With Droll: 19 Mult.\n*   Total Mult: 19 * 6 = 114.\n*   Score: 320 * 114 = 36,480.\n    The level 8 Flush will have a score of about 36,480.\n\nI need the shop visit *before* The Flint to have the best chance. I should use both Jupiter cards now. I am in the blind, so Perkeo has already triggered at the end of the last shop. Since I only have one action per turn, I can only use a single consumable.\n\nPlan: Use the Jupiter card now in position 1. Since I can only perform one action this round, I should use only a single consumable. After that I have to think about the order of jokers. I need to get the multiplier as high as possible.\n\nOkay, let's verify if Droll's +10 and X1.5 trigger in the correct sequence.\nRule: \"Independent' Jokers activate left-to-right\".\nDroll is Polychrome.\nUsually, a card's base effect triggers, then its edition.\nIf Droll is in slot 1:\nMult = (Base + 10) * 1.5 * Ramen * Tribe.\nIf Droll is in slot 3:\nMult = (Base * Ramen * Tribe + 10) * 1.5.\nClearly slot 1 is better for the +10 mult.\n\nWait, what about Stuntman? Stuntman provides chips. Chip calculation happens before Mult.\nSo Joker order for chips vs mult doesn't matter unless a Joker does both or depends on the other.\nThe order 1, 2, 3 is correct for the mult scaling.\nPlan: Use Jupiter (pos 1).\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
