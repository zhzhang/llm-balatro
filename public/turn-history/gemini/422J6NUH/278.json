{"reasoning":"**Final Boss Optimization**\n\nOkay, this is it, the final Ante and Round 21. It's SHOP, and I'm at the point where I want to squeeze out every last point for the final score. I've got a Flush build, Level 13, and currently sitting at $12. The goal here is simple: maximize that final boss score.\n\nLooking at my Jokers, I'm in a good spot. The Tribe (x2 Flush mult), Droll Joker (+10 mult, x1.5 Polychrome), Ramen (x2 mult, decreasing), Stuntman (+250 chips), and Brainstorm (copying The Tribe) are all working well together. I have a Judgement consumable, but it's useless unless I sell a Joker.\n\nThe shop has Fortune Teller (+30 Mult), Venus (Three of a Kind level up), The Family (x4 Four of a Kind), and Sock and Buskin (retrigger face cards). Nothing here is a perfect fit for my Flush, although Fortune Teller is tempting. Is it a good replacement for the Droll Joker? Hmm. Let's do the calculation: 28 base + 10 Droll (38 mult) x 12. If I swap it for Fortune Teller, it's 28 + 30 (58 mult) x8... a marginal upgrade, but I have Judgement... \n\nOh wait, I don't need to optimize. It is the final boss round!\n\nI've already hit about 178k-212k, and since I'm at the end of the run, I'm heading directly into the final boss round. This means, the most logical step is to spend all my remaining money on the shop. I've got $12. Reroll costs $4. So I will have $8 left.\n\nSo the plan is, since this is the final boss, I need to spend it to optimize it. Rerolling is the play. I'm looking for Jupiter (Flush Planet) or a good Tarot (The Hierophant, The Empress, or suit converters, but nothing I have will really help me here), or anything to improve my score for the last blind.\n\nI'm definitely not using Judgement since I have all Rare/Uncommon/Polychrome Jokers. I won't risk selling one of them.\n\nSo, reroll it is. Let's do it.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
