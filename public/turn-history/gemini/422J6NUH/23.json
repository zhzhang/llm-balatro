{"reasoning":"**Current Balatro Turn Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We're at Ante 2, Round 3, in the SHOP phase, and I have zero dollars. My immediate goal, as established previously, is to level up my Flush. I have a Jupiter consumable card in my inventory – that's the key here.\n\nThe shop has two things: A Greedy Joker for $4 and a Jumbo Celestial Pack also for $4.  I can't buy either, I need to focus on what I *can* do.\n\nI want to use the Jupiter card to boost my Flush. The command for that is `use_consumable <consumable_position>`.  Jupiter is in position 1. So, the action should be `use_consumable 1`. I need to execute `use_consumable 1`.\n\nThe earlier reasoning was also to use Jupiter to level my flush, which is still the case. So, the action again is `use_consumable` position `1`.\n\nI'm confident in that, and let me double-check the schema to ensure I am formatting correctly. Looks like the `action` is \"use_consumable,\" `positions` is `[1]`, `intended_hand_type` is correctly set to `null` because this is a consumable and not a hand play, and `estimated_chips` is `null`.  Perfect.\n\nNow, should I sell anything to make a purchase? The Egg Joker's sell value is $7 right now. Selling it would net me enough to buy a Jumbo Celestial Pack for $4, leaving me with $3. I probably don't need this, because I am starting the ante with a flush level 2 and this should be manageable. My Gros Michel gives me +15 mult, which will help me clear the next round. I don't need the pack just yet.\n\nTherefore, the only correct action is to play the Jupiter card.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
