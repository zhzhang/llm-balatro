{"reasoning":"**Shop Reroll Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: Ante 8 is looming, and it's time to gear up for the Big Blind. I'm in the shop, with $33 and a Flush build already in place, but I can make it better. I've got a Level 12 Flush and a solid set of Jokers: Droll (Polychrome synergy), Ramen (X2 Mult), The Tribe (X2 Mult for Flush), Perkeo (Legendary, cloning consumables), and Stuntman. My goal is to maximize my winnings with the Flush.\n\nThe key here is Perkeo. Right now, it's set to clone my \"Judgement\" consumable, which creates a random Joker. It's not the *worst* thing, but a negative Judgement would be disappointing. What I really want is a Jupiter (Flush level up Planet card).\n\nMy initial options are The Order (Straight X3 Mult, not useful here), Egg (scaling sell value, not useful), and Raised Fist (Mult based on low card, again, not useful). Nope. These don't fit my Flush build at all. The Reroll cost is only $4, so I have plenty of cash to spare.\n\nI'm thinking: I should reroll and try to find a better consumable. Specifically, I want a Jupiter, or even a good Tarot card like The Hierophant or The Empress.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Do NOT use Judgement right now**. I have all Joker slots filled.\n2.  I can either sell Judgement now for $1. Then reroll.\n3.  Or I can just reroll.\n4.  Reroll the shop. This seems like the best course of action. I'm willing to spend to make sure my final hands are as powerful as possible.\n\nOkay, let's break down the reroll costs. I have $33. Reroll 1 will cost $4 ($29 left). Reroll 2 is $5 ($24 left), and Reroll 3 will be $6 ($18 left). With the Overstock Plus and voucher, the odds of a good Planet card appearing is decent.\n\nSo, I'm going to reroll the shop. The current shop cards are useless, and I need a better consumable. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
