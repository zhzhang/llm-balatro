{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy Review and Optimization**\n\nOkay, let's take stock of the situation. Ante 6, Round 15. The immediate goal is clear: maximize that Flush level using Perkeo to clone Jupiter. Money's not the primary concern right now; score scaling is. I have $119, so let's see what we can do.\n\nFirst, the Joker order. Additive multipliers before multiplicative ones.  And then, within those independent Jokers, left to right.  So, Blue Joker for chips, then Gros Michel, then Droll Joker. Droll Joker's Polychrome comes into effect during the independent check, which will be triggered after the other addititive components.  Ramen's x2 will go last, and Perkeo can go at the end since it's utility only. Specifically:\n\n1.  Blue Joker (chips)\n2.  Gros Michel (+15 mult)\n3.  Droll Joker (+10 mult, x1.5 mult)\n4.  Ramen (x2 mult)\n5.  Perkeo (clone consumable).\n\nChecking my notes, I need to rearrange Jokers. My current order is: Gros Michel, Droll, Perkeo, Blue, Ramen. So the optimal arrangement is:\n\n1.  Blue Joker\n2.  Gros Michel\n3.  Droll Joker\n4.  Ramen\n5.  Perkeo\n\nNow, on to the shop. Jumbo Celestial Pack and a regular Celestial Pack are available. High probability of getting more Jupiter cards. Those packs are my priority. I'll need to buy at least one to level up that Flush. I'll wait on actually *using* Jupiter until Perkeo can copy it at the end of the shop phase. Specifically, if I open packs and get a Jupiter, use it immediately (unless Perkeo can clone it), unless I have two Jupiters. Perkeo will copy one of them.\n\nNow, I have $119. The immediate action is to buy a booster. The Jumbo Celestial Pack offers the best chance at a Jupiter.\n\n*   `action`: \"buy\\_booster\"\n*   `positions`: \\[1]\n\nHold on, Rocket (Foil) is available in the shop, but that's not worth considering. The priority is score scaling. My current Jokers are stronger than that Rocket, so I'll stay the course. So I'll stick to buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack (Position 1).\n\n*   `action`: \"buy\\_booster\"\n*   `positions`: \\[1]\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
