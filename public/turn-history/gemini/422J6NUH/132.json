{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy Assessment: Flush Build**\n\nOkay, so Ante 5, Round 12. Big Blind is coming up, and I need to be ready to clear about 15,000 to 20,000 chips. I have $32 in the bank, which is good. I need to make sure I’m using my money efficiently.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid right now: I've got Gros Michel (risky, but potentially huge), Egg (passive income), Droll Joker (essential for the Flush build), Perkeo (Legendary, which is *vital*), and Blue Joker (chip booster). I also have \"The Moon\" consumable, which is *critical* for this build and should be copied by Perkeo.\n\nThe shop is currently offering some cards that are completely useless for me: Crazy Joker (Straight boost, not relevant), Superposition (Straight synergy, also irrelevant), and Misprint (Too unreliable for my taste).\n\nI have to think about interest. I want to stay above $25 to maximize interest. With $32, I’m earning the maximum $5 interest. The reroll cost is $5. So, if I reroll, I'll be at $27.\n\nSo, here's the plan: I’m going for a Flush strategy. My initial math is: 80 (Flush base) + 94 (Blue Joker) + ~30-40 (played cards) = ~210 Chips. Multiplier is 10 (base) + 15 (Gros Michel) + 10 (Droll) = 35. The Droll's Polychrome bonus is 35 * 1.5 = 52.5. Total score per hand should be around 210 * 52.5 = 11,025. I think I will need to play the Flush hand twice. So, I need to clear around 22,050 total.\n\nGiven this, I should be looking to maximize a powerful scoring hand. I need to reroll. I have $32, and $5 is the reroll cost. So, this puts me at $27. I can keep max interest. I don’t see anything I want to buy. I am not selling the Egg.\n\nSo, I’m going to **`reroll_shop`**.\n\nHold on, I did a reroll on the previous turn as well. If the shop is still garbage, should I just leave it? I'll re-assess this.\n\nOkay, let's re-think this. The Moon consumable is the key here. Perkeo copies *a random* consumable. I only have one, so Perkeo will copy “The Moon”. This is *incredibly* strong for building a Club-heavy hand. Now, my plan is to reroll to see if I can get a better Joker (Jupiter is a *massive* prize), or if I find something else powerful. I'm going to stay above $25 as much as possible. Even if I dip, I have the Egg ($34) which can be my emergency fund.\n\nOkay. **`reroll_shop`**.\n\nBefore I roll, let me double-check the order of my Jokers. It is: Gros Michel (+15), Egg (Income), Droll (Add Mult, Polychrome Mult), Perkeo (Utility), Blue Joker (Chips). The scoring calculation is (Base Multi + 15 + 10) * 1.5. This is correct.\n\n**`reroll_shop`**!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
