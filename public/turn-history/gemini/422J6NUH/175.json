{"reasoning":"**My Decision: Selecting Neptune**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thought process. I'm at Ante 6, Round 15, staring down a `PLANET_PACK` choice. My immediate goal is to maximize my score scaling, specifically focusing on boosting my Flush level.\n\nLooking at the options, I have: Neptune, which levels up Straight Flush (currently at level 4), Uranus, which levels up Two Pair, and Earth, which boosts Full House. My strategy has been centered around Flushes. While none of these options directly say \"Flush\", Neptune offers the largest stat boost. Since Straight Flushes are rare and impactful, leveling it makes the most sense.\n\nI have $112. Considering my Jokers—Gros Michel, Droll Joker, Perkeo, Blue Joker, and Ramen—I need to leverage them well. I'm also holding Jupiter, which, as I recall from Turn 174, I want to keep it to clone with Perkeo.\n\nTherefore, the choice is clear. I’m going to select Neptune to immediately level up Straight Flush. This action is a `select` with `[1]` as its position. The planet card will be immediately used from the booster pack, without going to the consumable inventory. This choice aligns with my overarching strategy of focusing on the highest-value card for that specific pack, which will boost my high score.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
