{"reasoning":"**Balatro Strategy: Ante 8 Optimization**\n\nOkay, so it's the final ante, Round 19, and the SHOP phase. I've got $50. My goal is clear: dominate Ante 8. My current hand is a Flush at Level 10, that's my main scoring strategy. I have a decent Joker setup: Droll Joker (+10 Mult), Ramen (X2 Mult), The Tribe (X2 Mult on Flush), Perkeo (Legendary – copy consumable), and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size). My Jokers are all set, and I have no consumables, but I have Reroll Surplus, Blank, Clearance Sale, Overstock, and Wasteful vouchers.\n\nThe key here is Perkeo. I need to trigger its ability by *having* a consumable at the end of the shop. I need to focus on getting a consumable. I have some options: Celestial Pack ($3), Arcana Pack ($3), and Overstock Plus Voucher ($7), along with Earth, Mad Joker, and Mercury in the shop.\n\nMy initial thought was to buy the Celestial Pack hoping for Jupiter (which boosts Flush level), and keep it for Perkeo. However, that wouldn't work; Celestial packs have to be used immediately. Ideally, I'd get Jupiter, *keep* it, and Perkeo would create a negative copy. The Arcana pack could give me something like Strength or Death to improve the deck. I could buy Earth or Mercury to use as a consumable, but I don't want to use those cards in the game.\n\nSo, let's step back and look at the strategy here. If I can get a Planet card directly from the shop (other than the full-house and pair cards), I can buy it and *hold* it to be copied by Perkeo. That's the ideal situation.\n\nBefore anything else, I should check the Overstock Plus Voucher. But, I need to check the packs first! I have $50, so I can buy it now.\n\nThe *most* logical first action is to see what's in the packs first.\n\nTherefore, the action I should take is to \"buy_booster\" at Position 1 (Celestial Pack).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
