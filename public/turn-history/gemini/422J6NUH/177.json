{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Making Strategic Decisions**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6, Round 15, and I'm in the SHOP phase with $109. My current setup is looking pretty solid, but there's always room for improvement. I've got a decent hand strategy going with Flush (Level 4) and some key Jokers: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Droll Joker (+10 Mult on Flush, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (Clones consumables, which is great with Jupiter), Blue Joker (+94 Chips), and Ramen (x2 Mult). I have 5/5 Joker slots and 2/2 Consumable slots. The Jupiter consumable is the main one.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Mail-In Rebate (Holo) is tempting with its +10 Mult, but Gros Michel already gives me +15. The Joker Stencil is useless with all my slots filled. Gluttonous Joker isn't relevant to my clubs-heavy strategy.\n\nConsidering the Jokers, I need to ensure they're in the right order for maximum effect. I've got Gros Michel, Droll, Blue Joker, Perkeo, and Ramen. Scoring order is key here, making sure +Mult Jokers are applied before xMult. Currently, the order is Gros Michel -> Droll -> Blue Joker -> Ramen. This appears to be correct, with the +Mult Jokers grouped together, followed by the xMult Jokers.\n\nMy initial thoughts are to:\n1.  **Reroll:** I have plenty of cash and need to hunt for better options, Tarot cards to improve the deck, Planet cards or vouchers. My previous action was a reroll.\n2.  **Proceed:** Move on, though I should consider some rerolls.\n\nNow, let's look at the actual decisions.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I don't use Jupiter so that Perkeo can copy it. I think I haven't done that, so that's good. I don't see any reason to `round_select` right now, as I'm in a good position to shop. I'll stick with rerolling, given my large bankroll. The reroll cost is only $4.\n\nGiven that I have a ton of money, and since I need to maximize value in the shop, I'll `reroll_shop`.\n\nI just have to make sure to review the store again.\nMail-In Rebate is nice, but I want to keep Gros Michel.\n\nI need to make sure the Joker order is the best, where the +Mult jokers go first, followed by the xMult jokers.\n\nI should also make sure to check all of the options in the shop before finishing.\nLet's make sure the order is Gros Michel, Droll Joker, Ramen. The Blue Joker's position doesn't matter, as its chips are added to the \"Chips\" side, and the other Jokers are added to the \"Mult\" side.\nThe + and x Jokers should be in order: (+15), (+10), (x1.5), (x2)\n\nThe correct order is to reroll.\nSo that's what I'll do.\n\nI'll check the Voucher and Booster slots.\n\nThen I will `reroll_shop`.\nI have so much money that it is trivial to do this.\n\nRerolling again!\n\nAnd one more time...I still have so much money it doesn't matter.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
