{"reasoning":"**My Current Strategy: Flush Focus, Time to Reroll**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 6, Round 15. I've got a decent amount of cash, $112, and my Joker setup is pretty solid: Gros Michel for the flat +15 Mult, Droll for the Flush synergy (+10 Mult and Polychrome boost), Perkeo to copy consumables, Blue Joker for the flat +94 Chips, and Ramen for that sweet x2 Mult multiplier. I also have Jupiter ready to boost my Flush levels to 4.\n\nMy current focus is Flushes, so I am fishing for good consumables. Perkeo is key here, copying the Jupiter. The current shop doesn't really have anything appealing: Sixth Sense is unreliable, The Empress isn't critical for my build at the moment. Riff-Raff gives common jokers, but I have a full Joker board.\n\nI've already rerolled twice this turn, so I need to make the shop count. I've thought about it, and the Empress may be useful later, but for now I want to find something better. I've already realized that I want to keep Jupiter as the only consumable to ensure Perkeo copies it. So I really should avoid buying anything that will mess with this, for now.\n\nI could save the money and hit round select, but with $112 in the bank, I should take another look. I am fishing for:\n\n1.  Planet Packs (Celestial Packs) to find more Jupiter/Mars/etc.\n2.  Tarot Packs (Arcana Packs) to get more money or deck manipulation.\n3.  Better Jokers (replacing Gros Michel or Blue Joker eventually).\n\nI don't see any boosters or vouchers in this shop, only cards. So, I will do one more reroll, as the current cards don't particularly help me.\n\nFinally, I just need to make sure my Joker order is optimal: it looks fine as it is. Action: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
