{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Final Stretch: Ante 8, Round 20**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: we're deep into Ante 8, Round 20, and it's PLANET_PACK time. The goal is straightforward: beat the Big Blind and Boss Blind. The core strategy is locked on Flushes, currently at Level 11, and that's the key to victory.\n\nI've got a solid Joker lineup: Droll Joker (essential flush multiplier), Ramen (decreasing multiplier, but still useful), The Tribe (flush synergy), Perkeo (Legendary, for consumable shenanigans), and Stuntman (chip boost, but the hand size reduction is a downside). I have a maximum of 5 Jokers equipped, and no consumables at the moment. Money is at $38.\n\nThe choices in the Planet Pack are: Mercury (Pair), Earth (Full House), and Jupiter (Flush). Given the flush focus, Jupiter is the clear winner to level up the Flush to Level 12. No question there.\n\nNow, Perkeo is the tricky element. Perkeo creates a Negative copy of a consumable at the end of the shop. Since this is a Celestial Pack, Jupiter will be used immediately. It won't stick around in my inventory for Perkeo. So, I need to get a consumable *before* leaving the shop to leverage Perkeo.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to select Jupiter (Position 3) from the Planet Pack. That'll bump the Flush level. Then, I'll return to the shop and see if any useful consumables pop up (Saturn or Venus are possibilities). If the shop options are weak, I might even consider a reroll to find a more powerful consumable to hold for Perkeo to duplicate. Hopefully, I can find another Jupiter or a useful Tarot card.\n\nEssentially, I'm choosing Jupiter from the pack now, and will select it with the command \"select 3\". My target will be none. The schema is happy with just the `action` and `positions`. Jupiter is absolutely the right play here, since my flush is my main score. There's zero reason to skip this choice.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
