{"reasoning":"**The Plan: Flush for the Win (and Hopefully, Perfection)**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm staring down The Mark, need a hefty 11,920 more chips to hit the 22,000 target, and I've only got three hands left. This means I need to maximize my scoring potential. My mind immediately gravitates towards Flushes – they're my bread and butter. I've got a decent setup with the Gros Michel and Droll Joker bonuses, so a good Flush could get me close.\n\nThe Boss effect, though, that's the kicker – face-down cards after a hand. But wait, after a discard? That's the real question. Let's see... *re-reads boss* \"Cards drawn face down after *each hand played*.\" Aha! The phrasing is key. It doesn't mention discards. That gives me an idea.\n\nI've got a hand with a 3 of Clubs and five face-down cards. And *two* \"The Moon\" cards. I've also got the Blue Joker (chips) and the other Jokers (Mult). I want to play to the strength of the deck, which is heavily skewed towards Clubs (24/34 cards).\n\nMy initial instinct was to burn the \"The Moons\" to *guarantee* a Flush by turning non-Clubs into Clubs. But then I have an epiphany: I've got 4 discards. I should discard the face-down cards. Wait... no, I should discard the *non-Clubs* first. That should give me a better chance of drawing face-up Clubs. *Double checks the rules* Yes, the Boss' effect only triggers on hands played.\n\nWhy didn't I think of this sooner? Instead of locking into the \"The Moon\" strategy immediately, I have a more elegant option. If I discard the two non-Clubs (the 8 of Diamonds and 2 of Diamonds), the replacement cards will be FACE UP! Then I can either use the \"The Moon\", or play the hand as is (discarding the faces if need be).\n\nActually... why not discard ALL the face-down cards? If I discard *all* face-down cards, I get a whole new hand, *completely* face-up, and can pick and choose the best Clubs to go for a Flush. This is it. Discard all the face-down cards.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,7]"}
