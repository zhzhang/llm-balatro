{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Shop: A Strategic Dance with Perkeo**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop, Round 20, with the final stretch – the Big and Boss Blinds – looming. My primary objective is to maximize my score. I've got a solid Flush going, Level 10, but I need to make the most of my Jokers and consumables.\n\nRight now, I'm fixated on Perkeo. This Joker's duplication ability is a game-changer, and I need to ensure I have a consumable to duplicate before leaving. My consumables are currently empty. I've got $44, so money isn't an immediate issue, but I don't want to waste it.\n\nMy initial thought was to grab Saturn or Venus, since they are immediately available. However, a key realization hit me: the Celestial Packs are \"use immediately.\" I can't hold those for Perkeo's duplication, so those are out of the equation for now. Then I thought I should grab a Crafty Joker and ditch it for the Stuntman. However, I have all 5 Joker slots full.\n\nThe shop offers a few choices: Saturn, Venus, Crafty Joker, and two Celestial Packs. Rerolling is an option, but it costs $3.\n\nI need a consumable. I can buy Saturn or Venus, but I need to decide what to do first. Let me buy something and *then* reroll.\n\nWait... Perkeo's ability! It duplicates a *random* consumable. Hmm. If I want a specific planet card, I should only hold that card.\n\nSo, here's the plan, I am going to buy the Celestial packs first, in the hope of finding a Jupiter or Neptune (for my Flush or Straight Flush). That would be great for leveling my hands. Then, I'll reroll to find something good for Perkeo to duplicate.\n\nOkay, I've got it. I have plenty of money, and I need to select only one command. So let's execute it: `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
