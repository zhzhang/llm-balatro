{"reasoning":"**Tarot Pack Decision Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's get down to business. Ante is 3, Round 7. I'm deep within this Mega Arcana pack, and the goal is clear: I'm gunning for Clubs Flushes. Money is at $75, which is solid. My joker setup is looking pretty sweet: Gros Michel for the mult, Egg for the value, Droll for the Flush synergy, Perkeo which is Legendary and a Negative copy generator, and Delayed Gratification which provides income. Five slots filled, just how I like it. Consumables: I've got The Moon, crucial for my Clubs plan. Vouchers: Reroll Surplus and Clearance Sale - good utility.\n\nThe pack choices laid out before me are Strength, The World, The Devil, and The Star. My hand right now: 10 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 10 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, and 7 of Diamonds. I ditched the 4 of Hearts and 4 of Diamonds last turn to make space.\n\nThe strategic focus is Flushes, Clubs to be precise, thanks to The Moon and Perkeo. So, I need another Tarot card. Strength is tempting, but the rank increases don't really move the needle for a Flush build. The World is immediately out: converting cards to Spades is counter-productive. The Star converting to Diamonds is also out. That leaves The Devil. A Gold Card, which is great for the economy, especially with Perkeo churning out suit conversions. The Devil seems the best.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. The Devil is the clear front-runner for long-term growth. My plan is to make the 10 of Spades (position 1 in hand) a Gold card. It'll stay in my hand for later. It is a good choice to target as I am aiming for Clubs.\n\nNo need to skip, The Devil (3) on the 10 of Spades (1), that's the play. I'll make the select action: `select 3 1`.\n\nPerkeo is my engine here. It creates a Negative copy of a consumable at the end of the shop. I have The Moon. Excellent. This is the heart of the engine!\n\nSo, `action`: \"select\", `positions`: \\[3, 1].\n\nLet's verify. The Devil provides a $3 income. Since I'm building for Clubs, I'll likely be holding off-suit cards, like this 10 of Spades, anyway while I look for Clubs.\n\nThe Devil (position 3 from the pack) on the 10 of Spades (position 1 in hand).\n\nJust a quick re-check: The Devil makes 1 selected card a Gold card. Correct!\n\nFinal quick sanity check on Perkeo: Negative copy of a consumable. And I have The Moon. Perfect!\n\nAnd let's make sure I'm not missing anything. I had chosen Immolate previously and had a $20 boost. My hand now is: 10S, 5S, 10H, QC, 7C, 7D. My hand size seems correct with only 6 cards, after the Immolate. The action is set and confirmed. I'm ready to proceed! `action`: select 3 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,1]"}
