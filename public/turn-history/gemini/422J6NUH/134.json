{"reasoning":"**Perkeo Play: Maximizing Flush Power**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, Big Blind's looming, and I'm sitting pretty at $25, which is the sweet spot for maximum interest. My immediate goal is to slam that Big Blind with a big Flush score. I've got a decent hand, and I'm leaning heavily on my Joker lineup: Gros Michel for the flat mult, Egg to help keep my chip count up, Droll Joker for the x1.5 polychrome bonus, Perkeo (the legendary consumable copier), and the Blue Joker to pad my chip count, based on deck size.\n\nThe Empress and another Joker are in the shop, but they're not a priority right now. I'm focusing on my Flush synergy and the Perkeo strategy.\n\nCurrently I have three consumables - \"The Moon\" (a negative that converts cards to Clubs, key for my Flush), Mercury (levels up Pairs), and Earth (levels up Full Houses). I need to get those non-Flush consumables out of the way to guarantee that Perkeo copies “The Moon”. It's a key play here.\n\nHere's the problem: Perkeo copies *randomly*. I need to \"clean house\" so Perkeo *only* copies \"The Moon\". The planets are the key!\n\nI need to make a single, clean JSON response with the action. It's time to trigger that Perkeo effect.\n\nMy first thought was to sell Mercury and Earth to open space, but it's *strictly* better to use them.\n\nSo, I'll use Mercury first to upgrade a pair, and then Earth to upgrade a Full House. Then, Perkeo will kick in and create a Moon. I'll get to see the result at the end of the shop.\n\nThe Empress in the shop would take me out of the sweet spot. A reroll is out of the question as well.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my inventory slots:\n\n1. The Moon\n2. Mercury (current)\n3. Earth (current)\n\nSo, I will use Mercury first.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\nThat is it. This JSON will trigger the next step.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
