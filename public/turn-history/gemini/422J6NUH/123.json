{"reasoning":"**Strategic Flush Play Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 12, Ante 5. I'm in the SELECTING_HAND step, with a Small Blind of 11,000 chips to beat. I've got a decent hand: 3 of Hearts, King of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, two 5 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs. My goal, obviously, is to hit 11,000 chips.\n\nMy Jokers are pretty strong: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg (decent sell value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Polychrome), Perkeo (Legendary - critical for consumable duplication), and Blue Joker (+2 Chips per card in deck, currently at +76). I also have two \"The Moon\" consumables that convert cards to Clubs. I also have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining. I've got a Level 4 Flush (80 Chips, 10 Mult) available.\n\nWith seven Clubs in hand, a Flush is the obvious play. I need to figure out the optimal cards for the highest score. I'll pick the five highest-value Clubs: the King, 10, 6, and the two 5's. That gives me 36 chip. The Level 4 Flush gives me 80 chips. Add the Blue Joker bonus of 76 chips, and I'm at 192 chips total.\n\nNow, for the multipliers. The base Flush multiplier is 10. Gros Michel adds 15, Droll Joker adds another 10 for the Flush and the Polychrome Bonus of x1.5. This gives me a total of (10 + 15 + 10) * 1.5 = 52.5 mult.\n\nMultiplying the chips (192) by the total multiplier (52.5) gets me an estimated score of 10,080.\n\nThat's close, but not quite 11,000. I'm 920 chips short. Thankfully, I have 4 hands remaining and 4 discards to go. This deficit is easily manageable over two hands, even if the next hand is not great.\n\nAbout the consumables: I should save \"The Moon\" card for Perkeo to duplicate it, so I should hold onto both of them, if possible. I could convert the 3 of Hearts to a Club to improve the deck, but there's no urgent need, given that I already have a flush.\n\nI don't need to discard. My intention is to play a flush. Let's make it happen. Playing those 5 Clubs is the best immediate path to winning the blind.\n\nSo, the action is \"play,\" the positions are [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (King, 10, 6, 5, 5 of Clubs), the intended hand type is \"flush,\" and the estimated chips are 10,080. Calculations are solid, so let's execute. The 920 chip gap will be trivial to close, so I will play the flush.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
