{"reasoning":"**Tarot Pack Decision Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 7, Flush build with level 5 Flush and level 5 Jupiter, aiming for that sweet, sweet X1.5 on a Steel card. I've got $81, the Droll Joker for polychrome mult, Ramen for discard mult, The Tribe for Flush mult, Perkeo (legendary) to copy consumables, and Stuntman reducing hand size.\n\nI have a hand of all Clubs: Ace, King, 8, 6, 3, 2. The goal is to maximize my Flush potential. I'm offered three Tarot cards: The Tower (Stone Card), The Chariot (Steel Card), and The High Priestess (Planet Cards).\n\nThe Tower is out, stone cards ruin Flushes. Not for me.\n\nThe High Priestess is tempting. It *could* give me another Jupiter, pushing my Flush level up immediately, or other planets for a minor hand safety net. But I have Perkeo to copy Jupiter every round anyway, so that long-term is a non-issue. I could create planets and only get 1/2 of them.\n\nNow, the Chariot: it's a Steel card. This is where it gets interesting. With Stuntman reducing my hand size to 6, and playing a 5-card Flush, one card will be left over in my hand. If I turn that leftover card into Steel, I get a permanent X1.5 multiplier every time I play a Flush. It's a consistent boost. My current Jokers are already giving me Droll (X1.5), Ramen (X2), and The Tribe (X2), so adding the Chariot gives me a solid X9 mult.\n\nIt's a no-brainer. Steel card is *always* good, even if my hand is already all clubs.\n\nAlso, I have to ensure Perkeo copies my Jupiter. If I choose High Priestess, I might fill my consumable slots with other planets, which means Perkeo will copy some other consumable instead.\n\nThe Chariot gets the nod. I will apply it to the 2 of Clubs (Card Position 6). That card will remain in my hand every time, and every Flush will be amplified. I already calculated the math: with such high mult, the steel card will beat +1 level.\n\nAction: `select 2 6`\n\nDone. Steel card acquired.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,6]"}
