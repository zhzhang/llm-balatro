{"reasoning":"**Round Decision Time**\n\nOkay, let's see where we are. Ante 4, Round 8, Blind Select phase. Got $26 in the bank. Good, good. I've got a decent Joker setup: Gros Michel adds +15 Mult, Egg for selling ($22, plus $3 if I play the round), Droll Joker with Polychrome (that's +10 Mult on Flushes and a 1.5x Mult), Perkeo (Legendary, clones consumables - just triggered the third \"Moon\" card), and Crafty Joker (a nice +80 Chips on Flushes). My Flush is already at Level 4 (80 Chips, 10 Mult).\n\nThe current Small Blind is $5000. Skipping it gets me $10 from the Skip Tag, but playing gives me round reward + hands + the shop. That shop could be crucial, especially since I'm looking for Jupiter to increase my flush level or a better joker than Crafty or Gros Michel. The shop also allows Egg to get the $3 value increase. Economy-wise, I'm good for interest ($5). I could use those \"Moon\" cards on this round to improve my chances of hitting the Flush.\n\nLet's weigh it: I've hit about 10k chips on the last flush - should be good to take on this small blind (5k). The next is a Big Blind at 7.5k and then the Boss is 20k, so it makes sense to go for the round. The $26 is pretty good too, since I get interest and don't need to save for the next round. Playing lets Egg grow by another $3 in value, up to $25 if I can get to the shop. The Skip Tag is nice for $10, but I think the shop will usually be worth more.\n\nBefore I commit to playing, let's just double-check the Joker order. Right now it's: 1: Gros Michel, 2: Egg, 3: Droll, 4: Perkeo, 5: Crafty. This order matters for scoring. Let's see... a Flush of say... 5 cards... The Crafty Joker adds 80 chips. Then Gros Michel adds +15 mult, and Droll adds +10 with a 1.5x Multiplier, meaning the flush totals to roughly 10.5k, which is good enough to clear the blind.\n\nSo, the rule is Jokers trigger left-to-right. Multipliers should go last to maximize their effect, but the \"Droll\" Joker has both additive and multiplicative on the same card. The order of Droll is +10 then x1.5, in that order, because that is how it is read as the hand is scored. If I have +15 and +10, then x1.5, the most efficient order is to have the other additive Jokers before Droll, because the Multiplier on Droll acts at the end, on the current total.\n\nTherefore, for this particular hand, my order is correct with Gros Michel before Droll Joker. Crafty (Chips) being last doesn't matter because it happens independently before the multiplier is calculated. So the current setup works!\n\nSo, the plan: Play the Small Blind. I have those three Moons to improve my odds of getting those Clubs.\n\nAction: Play round.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
