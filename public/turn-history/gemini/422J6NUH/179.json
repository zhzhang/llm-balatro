{"reasoning":"**Rerolling for Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 6, Round 15, Shop phase. Got $123, which is plenty to work with. My hand strategy is Flushes, level 4 thanks to Jupiter. My current Joker lineup is Gros Michel, Droll Joker (Flush synergy), Perkeo (legendary, for Jupiter duplication), Blue Joker, and Ramen. I've got a Jupiter in my consumables, which is the key to Perkeo.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Sly Joker is useless, and the Diet Cola I can sell for double tag but that's a no-go. With a low reroll cost thanks to that voucher, I'm definitely rerolling. The goal is to maximize score and win the run, so I need to find better Jokers, Planet packs, or Tarot cards. I'm prioritizing Flushes, using Jupiter to level them up, and then leveraging Perkeo.\n\nI'm thinking about the Joker order, just to keep everything straight. Right now, it's: Gros Michel, Droll, Perkeo, Blue Joker, and Ramen. Blue Joker adds chips, so position doesn't matter. The multipliers are applied in this order: +15, +10, then x1.5, and x2, so (+25) * 1.5 * 2. It's functionally fine for now, but I'm open to adjustments.\n\nSo, I'm going to *reroll_shop*. I'm burning that cash to find something better. No specific targets, just looking for upgrades that can give me a boost for more scaling.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
