{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization for Final Boss Showdown**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Final ante, Round 21, the last chance to rack up those chips and take down that Blind. My Flush build is currently pulling in some serious numbers (178,932 chips last hand!), and I need to maximize that to crush the 100,000 chip final boss. I'm sitting on $23, with my Flush-focused Jokers – The Tribe (X2 Multi on Flush), Droll Joker (+10 Multi on Flush, Polychrome X1.5), Ramen (X2 Multi), Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size), and Brainstorm (Copies leftmost, so currently The Tribe for double Flush mult) – all primed for action.\n\nThe shop has Jupiter (Flush level 12) staring me in the face, which is perfect! That card is an absolute *must-have*. It's a no-brainer given my build, leveling up Flush. I need to get it! I also have to consider boosters.\n\nGiven that Jupiter is in the shop, I'm going to buy it immediately. Next, I'll buy a Celestial Pack to increase my chance of another Jupiter or another card with high Flush synergy. A Standard Pack is tempting, but the Flush synergy is the priority. Rerolling the shop for $3 is on the table, too, to try to pull more Jupiter copies or those critical Tarot cards. And, definitely no need to use Judgement right now; my Joker slots are already jam-packed with high-value synergy.\n\nSo, the plan: First, I'm going to *buy and use* Jupiter – Action: `buy_and_use_consumable`, Position: `[2]`. Got to make sure I get that action and position correct; the schema says it needs to be `buy_and_use_consumable`, with Jupiter in position `[2]`, which is the second card in the shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
