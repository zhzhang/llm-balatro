{"reasoning":"**Current Turn Strategy: Big Blind (Ante 3)**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the Big Blind, 3000 chips required. The tempting \"Skip Tag\" for $10 is staring me in the face, but I need to think this through. My current hand setup is pretty potent: I've got a Level 4 Flush (80 chips, 10 mult) as my base, Droll Joker (Flush +10 mult, Polychrome x1.5), and Gros Michel (+15 mult). Let's do a quick calculation of a simple Flush (say, all Tens): 80 (base) + 50 (cards) = 130 chips. Then, 10 (base mult) + 15 (Gros Michel) + 10 (Droll) = 35 mult. Droll's Polychrome bonus: 35 * 1.5 = 52.5 mult.  Total: 130 * 52.5 = 6825 chips. Easy peasy to clear the blind.\n\nNow, skipping *seems* nice for the $10, but here's where it gets interesting. Playing the round gives me base winnings of $4, I can expect to get up to $5 in interest. Plus, my Egg grows by $3, and I have Delayed Gratification, which *could* give me another $2 if I don't discard. Okay, so that's already about $12 - $14 in value.\n\nBut the real game-changer is Perkeo. I have Perkeo, and he creates a *negative copy* of a consumable at the *end of the shop*. I have a negative moon already, which is amazing for getting flushes. The *key* here is the shop! If I skip, I go directly to the Boss blind and skip the shop. So no new consumable. If I *play* the round, I get to the shop, and Perkeo will trigger!  That's how I get another Moon!\n\nSkipping puts me at The Psychic, but I can easily play 5 cards - this blind is no problem. I could get the $10 from the Skip Tag, but at the cost of not progressing Perkeo! Playing gets me potentially more money and another Perkeo trigger. This is a no-brainer. Play the round! The shop is crucial for scaling.\n\n**Action: play_round**\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
