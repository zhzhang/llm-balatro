{"reasoning":"**Shop Analysis & Decision: Reroll**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 7, Round 16. I've got a solid Flush strategy going with Perkeo and Jupiter, hand level 5, and $69. Joker slots are full: Droll Joker (Polychrome), Ramen (X2), The Tribe (X2), Perkeo, and Stuntman. My consumable is Jupiter (Level 5 Flush). Constellation, Rocket, and Merry Andy are in the shop. The goal is scaling and to push past Ante 8.\n\nConstellation is immediately intriguing, given Perkeo's Jupiter generation. It scales with Planets, which I can get by burning the negative Jupiters that Perkeo is producing. However, that means I need to sell a Joker.  Let's weigh the options carefully.\n\nMy current Jokers are all high value. Droll Joker is a keeper for sure - strong mult. The Tribe is essential for Flush synergy. Perkeo is the cornerstone of my entire strategy; generating Jupiter is crucial. Stuntman is providing base chips for high scores. That leaves Ramen as the prime candidate for replacement, but it's a solid X2 mult.\n\nHere's the critical decision point: Is Constellation better than Ramen *right now*? Constellation starts at X1 but gains X0.1 per Planet.  I'm going to get at least 1 Jupiter this round, and then I'll get 1 per shop. So, in theory, I'd get X0.3 per Ante. I can get 1 negative per shop: Small Blind, Big Blind, Boss Blind. But how many shops are left?\n\nLet's do the math. At the end of the current round I'll get one. In this ante, that's one.  In Ante 8, I'll get one after the Small and another after the Big. That’s a total of 5 planets.  This leads to a total of X1.5 on Constellation, which is worse than the Ramen's X2. I can't see this overtaking Ramen in the immediate future to justify the sale. However, Jupiter usage *also* levels up the base Chips and Mult of my Flushes. A great combination!\n\nAlso, I have $69. A reroll costs $6. I want Jupiter cards, Tarot cards (suit conversion), or Vouchers. I'm prioritizing immediate scoring power, so I could use a reroll.\n\nOkay, let's look closer. I have enough money for several rerolls, staying above $50 for interest. The prompt says I get an extra $1 interest for each $5 over $0, but I normally get a maximum of $5.\n\nI'm rerolling the shop. My hand is solid.  The cards offered aren't immediately game-changing enough to disrupt what I have. Ramen is better now for the next few rounds.  Let's see what the next shop brings. `{\"action\": \"reroll_shop\"}`\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
