{"reasoning":"**Strategic Flush Play Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 13, the Big Blind is in play, and I'm staring down a target of 16,500 chips with a current stack of 10,395. That means I need to make up 6,105 chips in the next three hands. Discards are at 4, but let's see what we can do with this hand.\n\nI've got a decent Joker lineup: Gros Michel for a solid +15 Multiplier, Egg that sells for $34, a Droll Joker that'll give me +10 Mult if I play a flush and x1.5 Multiplier with Polychrome, Perkeo which is not useful this round, and the Blue Joker providing a nice +2 chips per card, currently at +68. The Moon consumable is negative, so let's ignore it for now.\n\nLooking at my hand: Ace of Clubs, King of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, 4 of Spades, 3 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, and 5 of Clubs. Jackpot! I have 6 clubs! I should be able to play a flush. Let's maximize the chip value by playing the Ace, King, Queen, 10, and 6 of Clubs. That's positions 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.\n\nThe Flush Level 4 will net me 80 chips and a 10 multiplier as a base. Playing the cards directly gets me an additional 47 chips, and with the Blue Joker that is another +68 chips. My estimated total should be 195. With the Gros Michel and Droll Joker modifiers, the total multiplier should be (10 + 15 + 10) * 1.5 = 52.5. So that's 195 * 52.5 = 10,237.5.\n\nMy current chips + estimated is well over the target! Now, is it possible to get a straight flush? The hand contains 5 Clubs: Ace, King, Queen, 10, 6, 5. No 4 or Jack. No straight flush.\n\nI am using a flush, so the multipliers all add up. I am good. Perkeo triggers at end of shop so not relevant here. No use in holding the \"The Moon\" card.\n\nHere is the JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 2, 3, 6, 7],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 10237\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,6,7]"}
