{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop - Ante 4, Round 8**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 4, Round 8. I'm in the shop with $41. My current Joker setup is Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($22 sell), Droll Joker (+10 Mult on Flush, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (Legendary, Negative clones), and Crafty Joker (+80 Chips on Flush). I've also got two \"The Moon\" consumables (both negative). My strategy is Flush (Level 4), and I'm really leaning on Perkeo to duplicate those negative consumables.\n\nLooking at the shop cards, I see Shortcut (Uncommon) and Mad Joker (Common). Useless. Not helpful for a Flush build. I'm not going for a non-flush build, obviously.\n\nNext up, booster packs. Standard Pack ($3) and Mega Standard Pack ($6). I don't think I need them right now, though. The Magic Trick voucher ($7) is also a no-go at the moment.\n\nThe core of my shop considerations is Perkeo and the Moons. I have two of them, and Perkeo will create a third, which could be really detrimental. I have $41 in hand and the max interest is at $25, yielding $5 interest. I can spend a lot.\n\nThe priority is clear: I need to find Jupiter (to level up Flush) or better Jokers. Gros Michel is good, but it might break, and Crafty Joker is decent, but only +80 chips. I want something with real scaling or multiplier power.\n\nRerolling seems like the best play here. I can cycle through the shop looking for those key cards. But let's be thorough. Since I have Perkeo, the Mega Standard Pack is probably a waste of money because I don't need deck manipulation for specific suits (Clubs in this case).\n\nWait a second. The \"Egg\" Joker. Its sell value is $22. Let's let that grow. No need to sell it now.\n\nThe shop is currently offering nothing that directly boosts my Flush build. Reroll cost is $4. I have $41. This is the optimal play.\n\nIs there anything else to consider? Moons? Perkeo? No. It's time to find a better shop. Now, let me check the \"round_select\" process. It's time to move on? Well, I *should* spend down to the interest threshold ($25), if the options are good. Rerolling should find those options.\n\nLet's do one more reroll.\n\nMy current money: $41.\nReroll cost: $4.\nAction: reroll_shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
