{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop - Flush Focus**\n\nOkay, so Ante 8, Round 20. I'm in the PLANET_PACK shop step. I've got $41, which should be enough for something interesting. My inventory is looking pretty good: Droll Joker for a solid flush multiplier, Ramen for a straight multiplier boost, The Tribe for more flush synergy, and Perkeo, which is the key here since I need a consumable to dupe. Stuntman is a nice chip buffer.\n\nI'm maxed out on Jokers and Consumables, and currently, I have none. Time to change that. My primary strategy is a high-level Flush - that's where the points are going to come from. I need to get to level 10 and keep going.\n\nLooking at the Pack Choices:\n\n*   Jupiter: This one is an obvious yes. Leveling the Flush from 10 to 11.\n*   Uranus: Two Pair level up. Not the focus here.\n*   Mars: Four of a Kind level up. Still not the focus.\n\nSince it's a \"use immediately\" pack, choosing Jupiter means it is consumed, which isn't ideal for Perkeo, but the level-up is too good to pass. I can still find a consumable for Perkeo to duplicate later.\n\nSo, I'm going to choose pack option 1.\n\nThe JSON should look like this: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`. Let's make that happen.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
