{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 7, Round 17. Big Blind is 52,500, and I've got $77. Flush is my primary hand, currently Level 6 with 110 Chips and 14 Mult, and I'm running Droll Joker, Ramen, The Tribe, and Stuntman for multipliers and chip bonuses, and Perkeo for cloning consumables. I'm holding a Jupiter consumable (Level 6 Flush).\n\nMy immediate priorities are to strengthen my Flush and maintain the Jupiter loop with Perkeo for sustainable upgrades. Looking at the shop, the *Mega Celestial Pack* ($6) is the clear winner here for potentially levelling up the Flush even further. The *Arcana Pack* ($3) offers some utility with potentially strong Tarot Cards. The Jokers on offer don't really fit, so I'm skipping them.\n\nNow, here’s the key strategic insight: I *must* keep that held Jupiter until after the shop ends. Perkeo will create a negative copy of it at the end of the shop. I'll then use that *negative* copy in the *next* shop phase, leaving the original Jupiter intact.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1.  **Buy the Mega Celestial Pack** (`buy_booster 1`). High value to level up the flush. This is the primary driver for today.\n2.  **Open the Celestial Pack**. I'll check for Jupiter. If I find Jupiter, I use it immediately.\n3.  **Buy the Arcana Pack** (`buy_booster 2`).\n4.  If necessary, I'll *reroll* if needed to find better consumables or permanent upgrades.\n5.  **Critical:** I am *not* using the Jupiter in my current inventory *at any time* before hitting \"round\\_select\". Perkeo needs that Jupiter to duplicate it.\n\nThe Mega Celestial Pack is the best immediate value, so that's the clear action to start this shop. Let's see what the cards hold.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
