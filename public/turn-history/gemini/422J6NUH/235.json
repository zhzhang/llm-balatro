{"reasoning":"**My Calculated Strategy for \"The Flint\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 7, Round 18. This is a blind select, and my target is \"The Flint.\" The annoying thing about \"The Flint\" is that it halves base chips and mult, so I need to mitigate that as much as possible. I need 70,000 chips, and I have four hands. Let's see what I'm working with.\n\nFirst, I need to look at my hand: I've got a Droll Joker (Flush Mult and x1.5 Mult), Ramen (x2 Mult), The Tribe (x2 Mult on Flush), Perkeo (Legendary that cloned a Jupiter), and Stuntman (+250 chips, -2 hand size). My two Jupiters are key. The Flushes are already at level 8, and I need to level those up now. I *have* to level the Flushes *before* playing against \"The Flint\" to get the most out of the fight.\n\nMy plan: Use the two Jupiters I have to reach Flush Level 10. That will boost the base chip/mult values. I need to calculate how this helps me beat \"The Flint.\"\n\nLet's look at the numbers. At level 8, the Flush is 140 chips and 18 mult. Level 9 is 155 chips, 20 mult. Level 10 is 170 chips, 22 mult. Against \"The Flint,\" those numbers get halved, so at level 10, that becomes 85 chips and 11 mult. Then Stuntman adds another 250 chips, and Droll adds 10 mult. The xMults are: Droll (Polychrome) = x1.5, Ramen = x2, and The Tribe = x2. All of that gives me: Base (85 + 250) * Mult (11 + 10) * (1.5 * 2 * 2). Which results in: 335 chips * 21 mult * 6 = 42,210 points per hand. Since I have four hands and need 70,000, two hands should do it (42,210 * 2 = 84,420).\n\nSo, the first step is to use the Jupiter consumables. I can only do one action in the JSON, so I'll need to do it twice. Since the action is `use_consumable`, and I want to use the non-negative Jupiter first, the positions are `[1]`.\n\nSo I'll just keep working through these as the game lets me.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\nOkay, the logic checks out. Time to move!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
