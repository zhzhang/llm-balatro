{"reasoning":"**Current Strategic Analysis: Ante 8, Round 19 – Blind Select**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, small blind is up, and I've got $33 in the bank. My hand setup is looking decent, but I'm really eyeing the opportunities here. I'm running: Droll Joker (additive mult and flush multiplier), Ramen (multiplicative), The Tribe (flush multiplier), Perkeo (consumable duplication), and Stuntman (chip booster, which is less critical right now). My Flush is Level 10 (170x22), and Straight Flush is Level 8 (380x36). The goal is to set myself up for the Ante 8 boss with its 100,000 chip target, and a priority on securing consumables.\n\nThe immediate question is: `play_round` or `skip_round`? Skipping would net me a Charm Tag (Mega Arcana Pack) straight away. This could give me a consumable, but crucially, it means skipping the shop visit, meaning Perkeo doesn't get to duplicate anything. Since I'm out of consumables after using both Neptunes, playing the round is the *only* way to actually find a consumable for Perkeo to copy.\n\nWinning the Small Blind is practically guaranteed with my hand levels. It's a quick $3 plus some interest, but more importantly, it's the shop. That shop visit is vital. I can pick up a consumable there, giving Perkeo something to duplicate at the *end* of the shop. I'm thinking a Planet or Tarot card.\n\nMy scoring logic is solid: Droll Joker's additive mult before the multiplicative multipliers. My current Joker order is optimal to maximize my score. Stuntman's placement is irrelevant since I don't have any jokers that interact with the chip value.\n\nSo, although the Mega Arcana pack from skipping sounds great, the potential to obtain a consumable for Perkeo to duplicate outweighs the risk. I am going to play the Small Blind. Action: `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
