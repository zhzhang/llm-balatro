{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop, ante 3, round 7, and the boss blind is next. I've got $68, which is pretty comfortable, and my current interest cap is $25. Let's see... I'm holding a hand (deck) that needs the right cards. My current jokers are Gros Michel (+15 Mult, with that annoying 1/6 chance to break), Egg (that's a solid money maker), Droll Joker (essential for my Flush strategy, and the 1.5x Multiplier is excellent), Perkeo (my core strategy with negative items), and Delayed Gratification (a good economical choice). I also have \"The Moon\" (Negative) which converts 3 cards to Clubs, if needed.\n\nThe real key here is Perkeo. I need to keep \"The Moon\" and have it in my possession when I leave the shop to trigger Perkeo's negative copy. It's crucial that I don't use \"The Moon\" before I'm done shopping, since Perkeo activates *at the end of the shop*. That's my main focus here.\n\nNow, let's look at the shop cards. *Ride the Bus (Foil)* is tempting with its +50 chips and scaling Mult. However, the Mult scaling requires no face cards. That's a detriment to my preferred Flush deck. +50 chips on a common joker is okay, but I have 5/5 jokers and the +50 chips is still relevant and that's not to be discounted. *Troubadour* is great with +2 hand size, but -1 hand. It could help me find Flushes, but I'm currently okay on handsize with 5/5 jokers.\n\nI'm thinking about my current jokers. Gros Michel, Egg, Droll, Perkeo and Delayed Gratification. The \"value\" jokers (Egg, Delayed Gratification) are decent but replaceable.\n\nRide the Bus (Foil) is very interesting for the +50 chips. My base level 4 flush is 80 chips, so that's a significant boost. It's a 62.5% increase.\n\nShould I sell Egg or Delayed Gratification? Egg is at $19 now, but scales. Delayed Gratification is only worth $1 but provides $4-6/round if I don't discard. If I bought *Ride the Bus (Foil)*, I'd probably sell Delayed Gratification. But the shop cards aren't transformative.\n\nI have enough money, and the current shop options are, at best, okay. I really want to find a Jupiter Planet card (for the Flush) or even some Arcana packs. I'll take the risk, so...\n\n*Reroll!* Cost is $5. Down to $63. Still well above the interest cap.\n\nWait, the key with \"The Moon\" is to *not* use it before the shop is over. So, I need it when I click `round_select`.\n\nIt's confirmed that Perkeo triggers at the end of the shop. If I have \"The Moon\" when the shop ends, I get the copy. If I use it before, there's nothing to copy.\n\nI'm going to keep \"The Moon\". Now, I'm going to reroll again.\n\nI should also check for any vouchers or boosters. Nope. Selling Egg is not correct, I will let that scale. Gros Michel is the least important Joker, and I would replace it with a Mult Joker.\n\nOkay, let's focus on Ride the Bus (Foil) again. The +50 chips is a 62.5% increase. It's a valid purchase for $6. It would be an excellent pickup.\n\nHowever, I will reroll! Let's see if something even better comes up.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
