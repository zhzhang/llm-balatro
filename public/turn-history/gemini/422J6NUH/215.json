{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the Shop phase (Ante 7, Round 17), with a clear objective: reach the Ante 8 boss. My strategy is a Flush build, currently at Level 6. I've got a decent amount of money, $68, and a solid Joker setup. My key Jokers are Droll (flush mult, polychrome multiplier), Ramen (decaying x2 mult), The Tribe (flush mult), Perkeo (consumable duplication), and Stuntman (+chips, -hand size). I also have Jupiter, a Flush level-up consumable.\n\nRight now, the priority is Perkeo. It's crucial I don't use Jupiter *before* leaving the shop, so Perkeo can clone it at the *end* of the shop phase.\n\nThe shop cards – Castle, Runner, and Abstract – aren't appealing enough to replace my current Jokers. I've already exhausted any boosters or vouchers. My last action was using a Death card in an Arcana pack to duplicate a Red Seal Ace of Clubs, which is a significant boost.\n\nBefore I go, I should quickly consider a reroll. It's only $3, and there's a small chance of finding a better Planet pack (Mars/Jupiter) or a Spectral pack, but I need to prioritize Perkeo and Jupiter.\n\nLet's do a quick calculation of my current score potential. A base Flush (L6) gives me 110 chips and 14 mult. With Stuntman (+250 chips) and Droll (+10 mult), I'm looking at 360 chips and 24 mult, but I still have my multipliers: X1.5 (Droll), X2 (Ramen), and X2 (Tribe) for a total of x6. So, 360 * 24 * 6 = 51,840. Red Seals and Ace chips will increase this significantly.\n\nGiven the money I have, $68, and the stable build, rerolling is a gamble. Perkeo’s triggering, not a reroll, is the focus.\n\nNo need to buy shop cards (Castle/Runner/Abstract); they won't help the build.\n\nThe next step is to head to the Blind selection screen.\n\nWait... I should double check the Joker order. My current setup is: Droll (+mult, x-mult), Ramen (x-mult), Tribe (x-mult), Perkeo (utility), Stuntman (+chips). The order is significant because of how Jokers are scored. Stuntman is the only Joker that scores on a played card. Droll adds value to the mult. The rest are straight multipliers. I checked my Joker order and confirmed it's optimal for maximizing the flush mults. Droll needs to be placed at the beginning.\n\nI have already done the main tasks in the shop, so the best move is to proceed.\n\nI just need to advance to the Blind selection phase.\nSo, `round_select` it is.\n\nOne last check. Rerolling the shop could give me a Planet pack or Spectral Pack, but I would like to prioritize Perkeo.\n\nI have just confirmed the previous turn and current budget ($68) is correct. I have no more boosters available.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
