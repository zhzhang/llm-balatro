{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision Making**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 7, Round 18, and The Flint boss blind looms. My main objective is to hit that chip threshold. I have $46, and I'm sitting on a Flush build, which is what I have decided to scale.\n\nHere's the situation: I have a solid Flush engine with Droll Joker (already strong with Polychrome), Ramen (decent, but degrades), The Tribe, Perkeo (key here!), and Stuntman. I'm holding Jupiter, my Level 8 Flush consumable. My hand levels are flush level 8, giving me 140 chips and 18 mult.\n\nI've already roughly calculated my current potential: ~65,520 chips per hand. However, The Flint is a major obstacle, halving my base chips and mult, which brings me down to ~36,480. I *need* to be around 100,000-110,000 to clear the Flint boss blind. This means I will get closer but not be at the threshold.\n\nHere's the crux: Perkeo is the linchpin. It *must* duplicate Jupiter to generate further scaling. The current shop offers Smiley Face (useless), The World, and The Lovers. Neither directly scales my score significantly and buying either jeopardizes Perkeo's target. If I buy either, there's a 50% chance Perkeo duplicates a card other than Jupiter.\n\nMy immediate need is to acquire another Jupiter and use it immediately while keeping one for Perkeo to copy.\n\nI'm sitting at $46. The reroll cost is $8. I can afford to reroll. I'm above the interest cap ($25) and have the capital to continue my hunt for Jupiter, or more consumables.\n\nTherefore, the only logical action is to reroll the shop to search for another Jupiter.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
