{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy in Ante 8, Round 20**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop with $31. The focus here is to maximize my Flush score, which means optimizing my Joker setup. My current line-up includes a Droll Joker, Ramen, The Tribe, and Stuntman. Position 4 is open since I just sold Perkeo. Right now, the most crucial move is to buy Brainstorm, which is currently in the open position (4) in the Shop, because it copies the *leftmost* Joker.\n\nThe plan is this: buy Brainstorm for $7, which leaves me with $24. Then, I'll need to rearrange my Jokers, which means I will have to decide which Joker is better to copy between The Tribe (X2 Multi if Flush) and Ramen (X2 Mult, loses X0.01 per discard). Currently the best is to copy Droll Joker to start.\n\nI thought about using the Judgement card first, but that's a bad move right now. I have only 4 Jokers, and I'm about to buy Brainstorm. If Judgement gives me a poor Joker, I'll have no space for Brainstorm since I can only hold a maximum of 5. It's much better to secure Brainstorm now. I'll save Judgement for later, or consider selling it.\n\nThe last thing I did was sell Perkeo to make space. Buying Brainstorm is the next logical step.\n\nSo, the action is `buy_card 4`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [4]"}
