{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Tarot Pack: The High Priestess is the Play**\n\nOkay, current phase: I'm in the `TAROT_PACK` stage with $32 and my sights set on beating Ante 5. My deck strategy is firmly centered around Flushes, which I've honed to Level 4, playing it 12 times. This pack needs to slot into that strategy.\n\nMy Joker lineup is pretty solid: Gros Michel is a good power spike. The Egg is a nice potential cash injection. Droll Joker is a flush multiplier, which is key. Perkeo will copy a negative consumable (The Moon) which is great, and Blue Joker is chipping in a good +78 chips from my deck.\n\nI also have \"The Moon\" which turns into Clubs.\n\nThe pack choices are: The Devil (Gold Card), The World (Convert to Spades), The High Priestess (Create 2 Planets), The Empress (2 Mult Cards), and The Tower (Stone Card).\n\n*   The Devil *could* be good, but money isn't a problem, at least for now.\n*   The World is completely useless for a Clubs-focused deck, so that's out.\n*   The Empress provides some quick multiplier, but planets are my true calling.\n*   The Tower card isn't helpful, and I'm not playing Stones.\n\nThis leaves the High Priestess. The potential for Jupiter cards – +15 chips and +2 mult for Flush – is too good to ignore. I have room for 2 planets (Perkeo + 1), and my hand is already heavy with Clubs, so this is where the action is. With my setup, I can duplicate The Moon, which would benefit from Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, the only choice I am making is to select the High Priestess (`select 3`).\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
