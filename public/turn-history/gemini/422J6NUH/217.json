{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante 7, Round 17 Situation**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the thick of it – Blind Select, trying to hit 52,500 for the Big Blind or snag an Ethereal Tag (Spectral Pack). The Boss, The Flint, is looming with halved chips and mults at 70,000. I've got $68, which is decent. Let's see... the Jokers are solid: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, and Stuntman. My Flush is already at Level 7, with a recently copied Red Seal Ace of Clubs for some extra spice. And, thankfully, I have a negative Jupiter! I used one already on the previous turn, so the state information is correct.\n\nThe first thing that jumps out is this Negative Jupiter in the consumable slot. I *could* skip the round for the Spectral Pack but that seems like a cop-out. I *want* to play. Let's crunch the numbers. Using the Jupiter now will bump my Flush to Level 8 (140 chips, 18 mult).  With the Stuntman's chip boost and Droll's mult increase, and the multiplier on the other jokers, I can easily exceed the Big Blind target. In fact, a level 8 Flush should generate about 65,520 even with my rudimentary calculation, which is more than enough.\n\nNow, I *could* hold onto the Jupiter, but it's negative, so it doesn't take up a slot. So I definitely want to use it. If I use it now, I'll hit the shop and hopefully buy another consumable so Perkeo has something to copy (remember, it *creates* a negative copy at the end of the shop). If I skip the round for the Spectral Pack, Perkeo doesn't trigger, and I miss out on potentially great cards and losing out on gaining more cash.\n\nThe Joker order is optimal: Droll is first, maximizing its impact due to multiplicative effects. No need to rearrange.\n\nThe plan is simple. Use the Jupiter. Then, go to the shop and buy a consumable.\n\nOkay, let's execute. Action: `use_consumable` at position 1.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
