{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante and Preparing for the Boss**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 8, Round 19, with the Small Blind next up, and $33 in the bank. The primary goal here is to be ready for the Boss Blind, and right now, my focus is on optimization. My joker setup is solid: Droll Joker with polychrome and a 10-mult, Ramen with X2 mult (I need to monitor the discards, but it should still be X2), The Tribe also with X2 mult on Flush, Perkeo which is a real asset for consumable duplication, and Stuntman for extra chips. I've got a Neptune consumable for Straight Flush leveling, which is what I'm going for.\n\nGiven the current shop, I'm not seeing any immediate upgrades. Invisible Joker is tempting, but it requires selling a joker now, and I don't want to do that. My jokers are all contributing significantly to the current build, specifically Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Stuntman, and Perkeo. No point in selling any.\n\nPerkeo will give me a negative copy of a consumable, so I should leave the shop to trigger this, which, I have. So, the shop is a no-go for me. I could reroll, but with Perkeo's guarantee on Neptune, it's better to stick with that, rather than risk getting a Jupiter instead. So I'm sticking with Neptune.\n\nI’m now doing a final check of my Jokers in the order they’re in. This is critical for getting the maximum mult. I've ordered them, and they are:\n\n1.  Droll Joker (+10, X1.5)\n2.  Ramen (X2)\n3.  The Tribe (X2)\n\nWhich means: `(Base + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2`, that is my mult. Perfect.\n\nInvisible Joker is still a distraction and the current shop isn't worth the reroll risk. I want that Neptune to be duplicated. So, no reroll, no shop purchases. I need to make sure I don't use Neptune until after Perkeo's effect triggers, since Perkeo only copies existing consumables.\n\nRight, `round_select` to move to the Blind selection and trigger Perkeo's effect, it’s the only action I need.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
