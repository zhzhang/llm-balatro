{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decisions in Ante 2**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in the Shop phase of Ante 2. I've got $5 in the bank. My Jokers are Gros Michel (a decent multiplier, but with a destruction risk) and Egg (which scales the sell value of cards – useful, but not immediately impactful). The Chariot consumable is also available. I have a Clearance Sale voucher for 25% off.\n\nThe Shop is offering The Fool ($2), which creates the last Tarot or Planet card I used, excluding The Fool itself. Then there's the Greedy Joker ($4) which gives me +3 Mult for Diamond cards (not amazing unless I'm going diamond-heavy), and two Jumbo Celestial Packs ($4 each) where I can choose from 5 planet cards which is what I'm looking for.\n\nMy top priority is maximizing effectiveness for the upcoming rounds. I remember using The Hierophant as the last Tarot or Planet card (or at least that's what my earlier analysis leads me to think, which makes The Fool worth it). A Celestial Pack is the perfect choice at this stage since I can scale my hand levels. Buying and using the Jumbo Celestial Pack is the strongest play for long-term scaling.\n\nConsidering my cash constraints, I need to choose wisely. I can afford The Fool, or one Jumbo Celestial Pack. The Hierophant would produce more chips than the Greedy Joker. I *could* buy The Fool, but I'd need to use it in hand. My consumables are 1/2. So I can hold it. The Greedy Joker seems weak, because I'm not forcing Diamonds.\n\nThe Celestial Packs offer superior scaling. They're priced at $4 each which makes it a great value with the voucher. If I grab one, that leaves me with $1.\n\nSo, I'm going with a Jumbo Celestial Pack to level up my hand, and it's the strongest play for long-term scaling.\n\nPlan: Buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack. So the action will be `buy_booster`, position: [1].\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
