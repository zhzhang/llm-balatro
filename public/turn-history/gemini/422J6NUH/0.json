{"reasoning":"**Initial Assessment: Ante 1 - Small Blind Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Blind Select, round zero, Ante 1. My goal is to either beat the Small Blind for 300 chips or skip it and get a Tag. I've got a measly $4. No Jokers, no consumables, and no Tags yet. The Small Blind skip gives me a Double Tag, which could be *really* good if the next Tag is valuable, but that's a gamble. The Big Blind skip gives me a Charm Tag – a Mega Arcana Pack – which is also tempting. And, of course, the boss is The Pillar, debuffing previous cards played, which I'll keep in mind.\n\nPlaying the Small Blind itself offers $3 plus interest and some number of remaining hands, which isn't bad for my starting bankroll, but more importantly, it unlocks the shop after the round, and that's *critical* early on. Skipping gives me a Double Tag, but delays shop access and earns me zero money. The immediate problem with skipping is the Boss, which I could only face with $4 and no Jokers.\n\nThe Double Tag is a tempting idea, especially since it *could* double the Charm Tag from the Big Blind if I skip both, but then I'm facing a boss with no resources. I need to get my hands on some Jokers *fast*! The Small Blind requirement is only 300 chips, which I can likely beat with a flush or a few high-value hands.\n\nUltimately, I need to get things moving. In Ante 1, playing the Small Blind is almost always the better choice. It jumpstarts the economy and gives me that crucial shop access. Skip tags in Ante 1 are usually traps unless they provide an immediate, game-changing advantage, like an Investment Tag, or maybe a Buffoon Tag if I was in dire straits. The Double Tag hinges on the quality of the subsequent Tag, which is too much of a risk right now.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
