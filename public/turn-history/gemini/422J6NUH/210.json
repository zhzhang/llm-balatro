{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7, Round 17. The goal is clear: maximize that Flush level, currently sitting pretty at Level 6, while keeping that sweet Perkeo + Jupiter loop humming. I've got this Mega Celestial Pack in front of me, five planets to choose from, and I need to pick two.\n\nThe key here is that Jupiter is *not* in the pack!  Therefore, I'll need to maintain this. The stakes are high. Flush is my game (21 times played!), so the priority is to keep it going or select planets with good scaling in case I don't hit a flush.\n\nLooking at my options: Saturn is a Straight and at Level 4, Venus is Three of a Kind and Level 4, Pluto is High Card and Level 3, Mercury is Pair and Level 2, and Uranus is Two Pair and at Level 1.  Saturn with its Straight, offers +3 Mult and +30 chips, is looking like the standout in this pack. Venus is a solid second choice with its Three of a Kind, offering +2 Mult and +20 chips. With it being a Mega pack, I'm leaning heavily towards maximizing the overall scaling.\n\nFirst: `select 1` (to pick Saturn).\n\nRemember: **Do NOT use the Jupiter consumable!** It's crucial for the Perkeo loop. I'll need to maintain that for the long haul. I'll pick the second planet from the pack. Action: `select 1` (Saturn).\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
