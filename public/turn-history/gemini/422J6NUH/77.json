{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment: Flush Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Round 8, Ante 4. I'm in the shop with $37. My core focus is maximizing this Flush build. My Jokers are pretty good: Gros Michel is my primary mult, though it has a chance to break. Egg is my savings, generating a nice return. Droll is a crucial engine, being polychrome with x1.5 mult and +10 on flush. Crafty Joker is decent chip-generation, and Perkeo, being legendary, is cloning my *The Moon* consumables, which is a key suit converter for the flush build.\n\nMy Consumables are 2 *The Moon*. The *Moon* is a negative consumable, so I don't know why the system says Max Consumables: 4. I know that Perkeo has one negative slot, so I have effectively 0/5 slots.\n\nVouchers are Reroll Surplus and Clearance Sale, which aren't immediately relevant.\n\nThe shop offers are:\n\n*   Riff-raff: Create 2 Common Jokers per round. Problem: I have no room (5/5 Jokers).\n*   The Empress: Enhance 2 to Mult Cards. This is useless here, since I'm in the shop.\n*   Standard/Mega Standard Packs: Potential for upgrades, but not critical right now.\n*   Magic Trick: Not a priority at the moment.\n*   Reroll: $5.\n\nRiff-raff is a no-go. I'm not selling anything for it, since Gros Michel is mult, Egg has value, Droll provides mult on flush, Perkeo gives the negative moons and Crafty provides chips.\n\nCan't use The Empress.\n\nStandard Packs are a maybe.\n\nMagic Trick is not a focus right now.\n\nMy priority is Jupiter (Flush Level), or a significant joker upgrade, possibly to replace Crafty or Gros Michel. $37 - $5 reroll leaves $32. I stay above the interest cap of $25, so I still gain $5 in interest.\n\nPerkeo clones a Moon *after* the shop, so it doesn't impact this decision.\n\nAlright, a single reroll is in order. It's a risk/reward assessment: searching for a better joker is the priority here.\n\nThe Empress: Forget it. No hand.\nRiff-raff: Nope. Not with Gros Michel.\nStandard Packs: Meh.\n\n**Decision: Reroll shop. Action: `reroll_shop`.**\n\nLet's confirm the interest calculation again: $37 - $5 = $32. The interest cap is $25, so I still receive $5 interest. Correct.\n\nOkay, end of the shop, I need to look at what to do: I need to `round_select` to start the round, after the shop. I should reroll to find an upgrade.\n\nWait, looking at Riff-raff. Gros Michel is +15. Riff-raff offers two commons every round. Blueprint or Brainstorm would be nice, but I'm full.\n\nSticking with rerolling. Still prioritizing Jupiter.\n\n**Current Money: $37**\n**Reroll Cost: $5**\n**Action: reroll\\_shop**\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
