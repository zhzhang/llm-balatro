{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's break down this shop phase. Ante 4, Round 9. Got $30 in the bank. Flushes are my primary play, aiming to maximize that strategy, and I'm looking toward the future.\n\nCurrently, I'm holding a strong Joker set: Gros Michel (a flat +15 mult), Egg (currently $25 sell value), Droll Joker (+10 mult on Flush/x1.5 mult on Flush, Polychrome edition - so double-up on the x1.5!), Perkeo (the Legendary consumable copycat), and Crafty Joker (+80 chips on Flush). I'm also holding two of \"The Moon\" negative consumables. I can use them to convert cards to clubs.\n\nThe shop has Business Card, Blue Joker and Magic Trick Voucher available. My Flush hand level is at level 4, which is 80/10.\n\nNow, my initial thought is: sell Crafty, buy Blue. Blue Joker provides a flat +92 chips to any hand, vs Crafty's +80 (but only on Flushes). Since Blue Joker is a straight upgrade, and is more versatile, this seems like the move, at the cost of $3. That's a +12 chips and versatility upgrade, which is a good trade.\n\nI'm holding two \"The Moon\" cards, so Perkeo will get one.\n\nBut, before I lock in the sale/buy, I need to look at my joker order. Right now it's: Gros Michel, Egg, Droll, Perkeo, Crafty. I need to make sure Droll's multipliers are being leveraged properly. Droll (+10 Mult and x1.5 mult) is Polychrome, so it gets x1.5 again. Given the scoring order (chips, +mult, xmult), it is important that all +mult Jokers activate before any xMult Jokers. Gros Michel, as a flat mult, should be to the left of Droll, for maximum impact. Since Droll's are independent, all effects happen from left to right. My current order is OK.\n\nSo, sell Crafty for $1, buy Blue Joker for $4. That'll leave me at $27, which is above the interest cap ($25 for $5). \n\nHowever, since there's an opportunity, I will consider rerolling. It costs $3. I will have the max interest at $25, so I can spend $5. I'm slightly hesitant, so let's lock in the swap first.\n\nBefore I go, I'll assess Blue Joker again, just to make sure. I'm thinking of my typical play of only one or two hands. Given my current chip/mult setup, Blue Joker is the objectively better choice.\n\nSo the plan now: `sell_joker 5` (Crafty Joker is in slot 5), then `buy_card 2` (Blue Joker).\n\nBefore finalizing, however, I just noticed that I have Perkeo, so I can save \"The Moon\". \n\nI should start by `sell_joker 5`.\n\nOkay. I'll execute the sell.\n\n`{\"action\": \"sell_joker\", \"positions\": [5]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
