{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Blind and Joker Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 18. This is \"The Flint\" blind, meaning my base chips and mult are halved, and I need a total of 70,000 chips. Right now, I only have $38 left. Let's see, my joker situation is as follows:\n\nI've got Droll Joker (Polychrome, +10 Mult if Flush, x1.5 Mult), Ramen (x2 Mult, loses x0.01 per discard), The Tribe (x2 Mult if Flush), Perkeo (Legendary, clones consumable at end of shop) and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size). My Flush is already at Level 10, so it's doing pretty good. I had two Jupiters, but I used them up. I'm out of consumables.\n\nThe current order of my Jokers is decent: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Stuntman. Let's make sure it's the most efficient. I know that the game calculates Jokers in sequence.\n\nI need to see how the Jokers interact with each other. The Flint has halved my Mult to 11. Droll adds +10 Mult, so that brings me to 21. Then, the multiplicative Jokers take effect: Droll's x1.5, Ramen's x2, and Tribe's x2. So, the order: Droll (1), Ramen (2), The Tribe (3).\n\nThe math works out to (11 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 126 Mult. Then I add my Chips: 85 (halved) plus Stuntman's 250, so that's 335 chips. Multiplied, the total score per hand is 335 * 126 = 42,210. \n\nSince Stuntman adds chips, its position in the sequence doesn't matter as much. It's the right order because I need the +Mult and xMult to calculate. I can't level up or add consumables. \n\nAlright, I've got no other moves. I'm going to commit to this round. \n\nSo the command is `play_round`, and I'm targeting a flush. This should get me about 42,210 chips. Let's play.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
