{"reasoning":"**My analysis begins now.** I'm in a crucial moment, Ante 4, Round 11, with a target of 20,000 chips and only 10,395 in my pocket. I have three hands to achieve this, with 9,605 chips still needed. My hand composition includes a potent array of Jokers: Gros Michel, Egg, Droll (a powerhouse if I play a Flush), Perkeo, and Blue Joker – a solid setup.\n\nI have a Flush-ready hand with five Clubs (7 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and two 3 of Clubs). But here's the twist: two \"The Moon\" cards, a negative consumable that converts up to three cards to Clubs. I have an ace of hearts, a two of spades, and a six of hearts in my hand that are not Clubs. Using \"The Moon\" on these three cards seems like a strategic move. \"The Moon\" will turn the hand into a full-house of Clubs.\n\nI calculate a Flush with my current hand would reach approximately 13,387.5 chips, exceeding the requirement of 9,605. But I can make this better!\n\nSo, the next action is a clear strategic play: use one of the \"The Moon\" cards to convert the non-Clubs into Clubs. I'll convert my non-Clubs (2 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, and 6 of Hearts) to Clubs. I check the schema, the positions, and everything checks out. \"use_consumable\" is the correct action.\n\nThe command will be `use_consumable 1 1 2 3`.\n\nI have re-read all the documentation. I can finally give the response.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 1, 2, 3], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,1,2,3]"}
