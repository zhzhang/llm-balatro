{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning for The Flint**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 18, with $72 in the bank. The current phase is the shop. My primary objective right now is to maximize my score for the upcoming boss blind, \"The Flint,\" which halves base chips and multipliers. I'm running a Flush build, and the current Flush level is 8, which, even halved, is decent.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid: Droll Joker adds +10 Multi to Flushes and multiplies the result by 1.5, Ramen provides a x2 multiplier, The Tribe also provides x2 on Flushes, Perkeo duplicates a consumable at the shop's end, and Stuntman gives +250 Chips, but -2 hand size. I have one consumable, \"The Hanged Man\". I'm at 5/5 Jokers, and 1/2 Consumables.\n\nIn the shop right now, I have Supernova, which adds the number of times the hand is played to the Mult, and Luchador, which disables the boss blind, both at $4. I sold Saturn to ensure Perkeo copies the Hanged Man at the end of the shop. However, if I can find a Jupiter planet card, that would be ideal for immediate scaling. I have enough money that I can afford several rerolls. The reroll cost is currently $3.\n\nLet's do some quick calculations. Even with the Stuntman bonus, the halved base chips and multipliers from The Flint are going to hurt. I'm currently at 370 Chips and 114 Mult. My current best Flush is worth 42,180. The last Ante's big blind was 51,000, and this one will be even higher. The Flint's penalty is substantial.\n\nThe current strategy is to use Perkeo to duplicate \"The Hanged Man\" to thin the deck. However, a \"Jupiter\" card (Planet Card) to level up my Flushes, duplicated by Perkeo, would be a huge boost. I also have enough money to use rerolls to my advantage. I can't think of any better immediate moves than to use rerolls to search for Jupiter, so I'm going to reroll. I'll need to re-evaluate the shop contents after each reroll.\n\nI can afford this many rerolls to help with my scaling, so let's hit `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
