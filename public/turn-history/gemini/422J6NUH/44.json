{"reasoning":"**The Perkeo Play: A Shop Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 6 of Ante 3, and it's shop time. Currently sitting pretty with $20, which is enough to make some moves. The goal here is twofold: secure a consumable for Perkeo to duplicate and generally improve this flush-focused build. I've got a decent hand level 3 Flush.\n\nMy hand: Gros Michel is great for raw multiplier, Egg brings good sell value, Droll Joker is a flush enabler, Perkeo is essential for late game scaling, and Delayed Gratification nets me solid money. I have a problem - no consumables. Perkeo is useless without one.\n\nLooking at the shop, the obvious play is \"The Moon\" tarot card for $2. It's a cheap consumable, perfect for Perkeo. I can't use it now, I *must* keep it in my inventory until the end of the shop. Perkeo makes a Negative copy. The other shop cards \"Hanging Chad\" is tempting, but I'm Joker-locked and prioritizing Perkeo right now. The boosters are also interesting: Arcana Pack for potentially *better* consumables and Jumbo Celestial Pack is good but I can't keep any cards to duplicate with Perkeo unless they make other cards. Buying and using them immediately doesn't help me with Perkeo. The Voucher is nice, but not my priority.\n\nThe play is crystal clear:\n\n1.  **Buy \"The Moon\" for $2.** This is the *only* consumable here that I can simply *buy and keep* for Perkeo. No brainer.\n2.  I need to hold onto it until the end of the shop to trigger Perkeo's duplication. This guarantees me at least a Negative Moon.\n\nThe schema for the `buy_card` command threw me for a loop there for a moment. But now that I've reviewed it, it's clear: my action is \"buy\\_card,\" and the position of \"The Moon\" is \\[1].\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
