{"reasoning":"**The Perkeo Play: Strategic Tarot Selection**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 18 with a $71 bankroll. The ante is at 7, and I'm holding a strong Flush-focused hand with all Clubs (A, Q, 10, 9 Bonus, 6, 3). My immediate goal is to prepare for the \"The Flint\" boss, who is a real chip and mult killer. Currently, my inventory is: Jokers Droll (+10 Mult, x1.5 on Flush), Ramen (x2 Mult), The Tribe (x2 on Flush), Perkeo (Legendary, Negative copy of a consumable), and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size). I also have Saturn (Level up Straight) in my consumable slot. Perkeo is key here.\n\nI have three choices in this Tarot Pack: The Empress (Mult card boost), The Emperor (Creates 2 random Tarots), and The Sun (3 cards to Hearts). The Sun is completely useless for my Clubs focus. The Empress offers a small mult boost but doesn't synergize with Perkeo.\n\nMy focus is on Perkeo. It creates a negative copy of a consumable. I have one slot occupied by Saturn, with a maximum of three slots, including the one granted by Perkeo. The Emperor offers the best route to Perkeo duplication, as it gives two random Tarots. I can use the best one and then copy that card next round with Perkeo.\n\nI'm looking for high-value Tarots like The Hermit/Temperance (Money), The Fool (Copy last Tarot - can loop stuff), Judgement/Ankh (Specific Joker stuff), or even card modification Tarots like Death, Strength, and Hanged Man. Even if I don't get the perfect draw, having a negative copy of a Tarot every round is extremely powerful, such as getting a free \"Death\" or \"Hermit\" every shop.\n\nTherefore, the obvious choice is The Emperor. I have two open slots and Emperor will fill them. Action: select, Position: 2.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
