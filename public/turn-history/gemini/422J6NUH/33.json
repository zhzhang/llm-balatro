{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Strategy: Perkeo Optimization & Economic Growth**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 2, Round 4, with the Boss Blind looming. I've got $4, and my current inventory is: Gros Michel (a solid +15 Mult), Egg (generating $3/round), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Mult), and, critically, Perkeo! The Soul gave me Perkeo, which is *huge*. This Legendary Joker creates a *Negative* copy of a random consumable at the end of the shop. This is key. The goal: Get a consumable (Planet or Tarot) *before* leaving the shop to trigger Perkeo's power.\n\nThe shop offers Delayed Gratification (good for economy) and a Standard Pack (playing cards, not consumables, unfortunately). Reroll is too expensive right now, $5, so I can't.\n\nOption 1. Buy Delayed Gratification for $3.\nI now have 3 free slots. If I don't discard, I get $6 back in this round. I can't find a consumable to help Perkeo.\nOption 2. Buy Standard Pack for $3.\nNo, playing cards are not useful for Perkeo, and will not let me make a copy.\nOption 3. Reroll the shop.\nThe shop needs a consumable. But the reroll is $5. I'd have to sell the Egg.\nOption 4. Sell the Egg to reroll.\nSelling the Egg gets me $10. I then have $14. Reroll for $5, spend on the consumable = $9 total. If I don't find a consumable, then the Egg's future value is wasted.\n\nI need a consumable! Right now, that means rerolling. It's risky. But Perkeo is an infinite scaler if I can get a Planet or a Tarot.\n\nNow, I'm thinking... should I sell Egg now? It's providing steady income. But, I *really* want to trigger Perkeo. No, I need to find the correct moment to use Perkeo's powerful ability. Okay, a consumable might appear next round, and this round I don't have enough to reroll.\n\nWait... I just realized I can't reroll without selling. I *have* to sell something or skip Perkeo this turn. Hmmm... is Delayed Gratification worth it? It's a Joker, not a consumable, but it boosts my economy. The Boss Blind is coming up in this round, so no discards used.\n\nChecking the Joker order: Gros Michel, Egg, Droll, Perkeo. Droll's +10 is additive for Flush and then the x1.5 from Droll Polychrome triggers after.\n\nIf I don't have a consumable, Perkeo is useless this round.\n\nShould I buy Delayed Gratification? My economy is already good.\n\nOkay, I have 4/5 Joker slots filled (Perkeo gives +1 slot, so 4/6 slots). Buying it would take me to 5/6.\nEconomy: Delayed Gratification gives $2 per discard (max $6/round). Egg gives $3/round (sell value).\nIf I buy Delayed Gratification, I spend $3. If I don't discard in the Boss Blind, I get $6 back. Net profit +$3.\nThe Boss Blind is Ante 2.\n\nBut, I only have $4! I can't reroll without selling.\n\nNow the shop items:\n*   Standard Pack: Adding cards usually dilutes a Flush deck.\n*   Delayed Gratification: Good for money.\n\nOkay, final joker order check: Gros Michel (1), Egg (2), Droll (3), Perkeo (4).\nAdditive before multiplicative with the jokers.\n\nThe \"Buy Delayed Gratification\" plan still holds. It's the best financial move right now, even if it delays Perkeo's immediate activation. It's either that or skip Perkeo (wait for the next shop) or sell the Egg and risk it. I'm going to buy Delayed Gratification.\n\n*Self-Correction*: Okay, I will re-check my Jokers. I will rearrange Jokers.\nIf I play a flush:\n-   Gros Michel: +15 Mult.\n-   Droll Joker: +10 Mult, then x1.5 Mult.\nTotal Mult = (Base + 15 + 10) \\* 1.5.\nThe order 1, 3 is correct (additive before multiplicative). Egg and Perkeo don't affect scoring.\n\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
