{"reasoning":"**Planet Pack Selection: Neptune is the Play**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I've got the `PLANET_PACK` open, time to select the best planet card for this flush-focused build. I'm currently at Level 4 for Flushes with 80 chips and a 10x multiplier, and I'm really leaning into Flushes as my primary strategy. My other hands are pretty low-level.\n\nLooking at the options: Neptune (Straight Flush), Venus (Three of a Kind), and Mercury (Pair). Initially, I thought Neptune was the \"best\" mathematically, but Straight Flushes are tough to hit reliably. Venus is more likely to trigger, but I'm flush-heavy right now. Mercury is the backup, but weak in comparison.\n\n*Wait a minute, deep breath, let's re-evaluate.* I have Perkeo, the Legendary copier, and two *The Moon* consumables, which convert cards to Clubs. Bingo! I can *endlessly* create Clubs and make Flushes (and eventually Flush Fives or Flush Houses) incredibly easy. This means a Straight Flush becomes much more achievable. It's a higher-tier hand than Flush, and potentially game-changing.\n\nI'm playing Level 4 Flushes, but I have the ability to shift into Straight Flushes with Neptune, which offers the highest value increase. I'm going to leverage *The Moon* to shift my deck to Clubs.\n\nSo, am I skipping this booster? No, it's free, so let's keep it.\n\n*Self-correction:* None of these planets directly help the primary strategy (Flush). Which one is the best secondary? If I'm using \"The Moon\" to make everything Clubs, a Straight Flush becomes much more achievable.\n*   Neptune (Straight Flush) has the highest value increase.\n\nI've got the logic down, it's Neptune.\n\n*Again, I have to check my hand levels.*\nFlush: Level 4 (80/10)\nStraight Flush: Level 1 (100/8) - With Neptune, it goes to Level 2 (140/12).\nA Level 2 Straight Flush (140/12) is significantly better than a Level 4 Flush (80/10).\n\nIt's clear, Neptune (Position 1) is the choice.\n\nLet's verify the command syntax: `select <pack_card_position>`. Neptune is at position 1.\n\nFinal check: I have $34. My plan is to buy the Jumbo Standard Pack after this selection.\nAction: `select 1`\n\nDouble check commands: `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> ...`.\nNeptune doesn't need hand targets.\nSo: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\nLet's re-verify the pack contents:\n1: Neptune\n2: Venus\n3: Mercury\nYes, 1 is Neptune.\n\nIs there any reason to take Venus or Mercury? No.\nThree of a Kind (Venus) is level 1 (30/3). Pair (Mercury) is level 1 (10/2).\nNeither is as strong as Flush or the potential Straight Flush.\nNeptune is the play.\n\nSo, that's the play. Neptune, position 1. And Jumbo Standard Pack next.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
