{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy and Optimization for Ante 5**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 13, Ante 5, with $29. This is a SHOP phase. I've got a decent setup right now: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($37 sell value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Mult Polychrome), Perkeo (Legendary, clones consumable), and Blue Joker (+94 Chips). The Moon consumable (which converts cards to Clubs) is my only consumable. I've maxed out on both Joker and Consumable slots. The game plan here is pretty clear: I've intentionally left only \"The Moon\" in my inventory to guarantee that Perkeo clones it at the end of this shop. That's my primary focus.\n\nLooking at the shop itself, Superposition, Green Joker, and Mr. Bones aren't particularly enticing right now. Superposition is irrelevant to my current build. The Green Joker is a pass; my current Jokers are significantly better. Mr. Bones offers insurance, but with $29 and the Egg, I'm comfortable. I considered a reroll, but at $3, I don't see enough upside to justify the cost. I'm already maximizing interest with my current cash flow, and I'd rather save for something better or future vouchers.\n\nI've achieved my primary objective of Perkeo cloning \"The Moon\". Now, I just need to leave the shop. It's time to trigger Perkeo and move on to the round. Since I only have one consumable, Perkeo will clone it, which I want.\n\nBefore hitting \"Round Select\" again, let's double-check the Joker order. My thinking is to maximize the Mult. I have: Blue Joker (Chips), Gros Michel (+15), Egg, Droll (+10, x1.5), and Perkeo.\n\nI want to make sure I'm getting the most from Droll, given it's a Polychrome Joker. I've confirmed that the Polychrome multiplier triggers *after* the joker's own mult, so the +10 from Droll comes first, and then the x1.5 from Polychrome is applied. Therefore, placing Gros Michel before Droll ensures that the +15 is added to the base mult *before* the Polychrome multiplier is applied, which is ideal. My current order (Gros Michel at 1, Droll at 3) is fine. Blue Joker is separate because it provides chips.\n\nEverything looks optimized. Let's move to `round_select` to start the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
