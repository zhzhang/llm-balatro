{"reasoning":"**The Poker Decision Tree**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Big Blind is 1200, four hands left, three discards. I have a Polychrome tag, so the next Joker shop buy is free. Let's see... the hand is okay, but not great to start. I have Gros Michel (+15 Mult) and Egg ($7 sell value), both of which are useful. Currently holding a Flush L3 and Three of a Kind L1. I need to figure out the best line.\n\nMy hand: 9H, 6H, AC, KC, JC, 9C, 9D, 2D. \n\nSo my thought process is: I need a Club for the Flush. There are nine Clubs in the deck (40 cards left). I have three discards, and a decent 3-of-a-kind (9s) right away.\n\n*   *Option 1: Play 3 of a Kind:* I could play the 3-of-a-kind, but that only gets me to 1026. Not enough. That's a no-go. The AC (bonus) would not score unless I made a flush or something else with it, which is not what I want.\n\n*   *Option 2: Fish for Flush:* Discard the non-Clubs (9H, 6H, 9D, 2D), leaving the Clubs, I have a 64% chance to get it. That's a good shot. A flush would get me 3335, easily clearing the blind. Okay, so that's the play.\n\n*   *Option 3: 3 of a Kind then High Card:* Play the 3-of-a-kind (1026) and then play the Ace of Clubs as a High Card. That would get me to 1762 - a guaranteed win in 2 hands. That is good.\n\nBut wait. If I can discard to get the Flush in one hand, it saves a hand. Hands are worth money at the end, $1 per hand, so that matters. So, I will fish for that flush, since I have a good discard percentage (96% probability)\n\nSo, discard positions 1, 2, 7, and 8 (9H, 6H, 9D, and 2D). Then play the hand as a flush.\n\nFinal thoughts: I can discard four cards - perfect! I have 4 clubs - AC, KC, JC, 9C. So, the move is to discard the other 4. So I will discard 1, 2, 7, 8.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
