{"reasoning":"**Rethinking the Flush Build**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 7, Round 18. The Flint is looming, which is going to cut my base chips and multiplier in half. I'm currently sitting on $64, and the following Jokers: Droll (Flush mult x1.5), Ramen (x2 mult), Tribe (Flush x2 mult), Perkeo (Duplicate consumable), and Stuntman (+250 chips). I have a Jupiter consumable (Level 8 Flush, 140 chips, 18 mult). My hand is already a Flush Level 8, which is a good foundation.\n\nThe immediate goal is to maximize my Flush level *before* the shop ends so I can trigger Perkeo's duplication ability. Specifically, I'm trying to get a second Jupiter using Perkeo so I have it for the next shop.\n\nLet's do a quick inventory check. I've got a Green Joker (Scaling Mult), a Lusty Joker (Polychrome, +3 Hearts Mult, x1.5 Mult) and a Faceless Joker (Foil, $ on discard, +50 Chips). Neither are *immediately* helpful, given my current build. Green Joker is useless, Lusty Joker is nice, but Droll's +10 is better than +3 and I'm playing a flush. Faceless Joker is a skip.\n\nI need to make sure I *don't* use my Jupiter before the shop closes, since Perkeo's ability triggers *at the end of the shop*. It duplicates a *random* consumable. Since I only have one Jupiter, it will duplicate itself. Right, right! So, what's my best play here?\n\nWell, since I want to try to stack Jupiters, I should keep rerolling the shop for another Jupiter, buy it, and use it immediately. Then, at the end of the shop, I'll have a *negative* Jupiter (the duplication), which is ideal, and the original, to use next round.\n\nI have $64, and each reroll costs $5. I can afford several rerolls, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.\n\nNow, wait... What else should I check? Overstock is active, so I have three slots. I should look at the current Jokers:\n1.  Droll (+10, x1.5)\n2.  Ramen (x2)\n3.  Tribe (x2)\n4.  Perkeo (Utility)\n5.  Stuntman (+250)\n\nIf I find Lusty Joker (Polychrome), is it better than any of these?\nLusty (Polychrome) is x1.5 and +3 on Hearts.\nDroll (Polychrome) is x1.5 and +10 on Flush.\nDroll is strictly better than Lusty unless I'm playing specifically Hearts, but even then, Droll's +10 is better than +3.\nSo, Lusty is a skip.\n\nNow, should I spend all the money? No. I get interest. Interest is $1 for every $5, capped at $5 ($25). I have $64, so I'm well above the interest cap. Spending down to $25 is fine. I'll fish for more Jupiters and use them.\n\nAction: Reroll the shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
