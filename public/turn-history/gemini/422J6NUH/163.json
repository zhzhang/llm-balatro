{"reasoning":"**Strategic Crossroads: Small Blind vs. Long-Term Viability**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 6, Round 14. I'm staring down the BLIND_SELECT phase. Small blind's up, followed by Big and then the dreaded Boss blind, \"The Club,\" which debuffs all Club cards. My current strategy is centered around Flushes, and I've got \"The Moon\" consumables to convert cards to Clubs. Perkeo just gave me a second Moon consumable. However, it looks like Perkeo only triggers *after* I leave a shop.\n\nMy gut tells me to *skip* the Small Blind. The Garbage Tag gives me $1 per unused discard, and it's built up to $48. That's a huge injection of cash. I currently have only $19. That's a massive deal compared to the measly $3 reward from the Small Blind!\n\nBut there's the shop. Skipping means no shop this round and no potential Perkeo trigger. However, I just triggered it last round and I *have* two moons in my hand. Plus, if I skip, I go directly to the Big Blind (30,000 chips).\n\nMy strategy is Clubs, so the Boss Blind is a major threat. I need to figure out how to pivot or survive. And $48 is a massive amount to help me do that! I can aggressively reroll in the next shop for better Jokers or planets to prepare for \"The Club\" (debuffs Clubs).\n\nBut wait...if the Club is debuffing my cards, it will still count *towards* a Flush. Let's make sure. The debuff means the card's chip and mult values are disabled, but the card *still* contributes to forming the hand. So a Flush of debuffed Clubs will still count, and I can lean on Jokers. The Blue Joker, Gros Michel, and Droll Joker will still be effective. I can create a big score! I can do this!\n\nSo, with my Jokers, I can get a score of about 9,000 points. To hit the 40,000 chip target, I'd need ~5 hands. But I need to double-check my hand count (discards too). I'm confident that $48 helps a lot more than trying the Small Blind (20,000). The shop can wait! The $48 is an extremely high-value economic boost, helping me secure my strategy and Jokers for the Boss. So, I will skip the Small Blind. The next blind is Big Blind (30,000 chips).\nI will now initiate the `skip_round` action. This doesn't need arguments. I'm ready to move forward.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
