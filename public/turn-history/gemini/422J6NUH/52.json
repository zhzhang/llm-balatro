{"reasoning":"**The Perkeo Flush Strategy**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 3, Round 6, with the Big Blind next. I've got $26, and the goal is clear: maximize this Flush strategy using Perkeo and \"The Moon.\" This is a solid starting point with Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and Delayed Gratification. The Moon is key, though. I need multiple copies of it.\n\nThe plan is to leverage Perkeo to create a Negative copy of \"The Moon\". Right now, I'm thinking about the shop. I've got Reserved Parking and The Magician available, and a reroll for $5. I can't use The Magician *now* because it needs targets, so it's not ideal for the shop. Buying it before triggering Perkeo could be a problem, since Perkeo might make a copy of it instead of The Moon.\n\nI'm focused on getting the Perkeo trigger on \"The Moon,\" ensuring the engine will work. I could reroll, but I'd drop to $21, and lose $1 interest. Is Jupiter worth it? I had a bad reroll before. Since I have a decent setup, the most efficient play is to proceed to the next round with The Moon to guarantee the flush engine.\n\nHang on, let's look at the Joker arrangement. Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and Delayed Gratification. The order is optimal. I'll make sure to get the most out of the round's scoring.\n\nOkay, back to the shop. The priority is getting Perkeo on \"The Moon\". The Moon copies make the Clubs flush engine almost unbeatable. Should I reroll one more time? I'm at $26. A reroll costs $5, so I'd have $21, and lose $1 in interest. Is it worth chasing Jupiter or a better Joker at this point? With the current set up, saving the money is the smarter play.\n\nRight. I'm going with `round_select`. This triggers Perkeo to create a Negative copy of \"The Moon,\" and that's the win condition here. And just to be absolutely sure... `buy_and_use_consumable` is out because The Magician needs target cards. So, final action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
