{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Decision: Ante 6 Shop**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop phase of Ante 6, Round 15. I've got $82 – plenty to play with, well over the interest cap. My primary goal is to keep scaling my flush-centric build to dominate future blinds. I've got a solid Joker setup already: Blue Joker (+94 Chips), Droll Joker (+10 Mult, x1.5 if Flush), Ramen (x2 Mult), The Tribe (x2 Mult if Flush), and Perkeo.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are centered on optimization and long-term planning. I've already checked the Joker order; Chip Jokers first, then additive mult, then multiplicative mult, and my current setup is optimal: Blue, Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo. Perkeo is key. It'll create a negative Jupiter at the end of the shop, which adds +2 Mult and +15 chips permanently.\n\nI'm evaluating the shop cards. Smiley Face adds +5 Mult to face cards, but with my current Jokers and strategy, it's not worth selling one of my existing jokers to make room. Pluto levels up High Card, but that's not helping my Flush build. I'm not buying anything that doesn't benefit the Flush build.\n\nRerolling is an option, but with my current cash flow, it's not a priority. I'd be looking for another Jupiter, a better Chip joker, or a powerful Voucher, but my existing setup is very strong for Ante 6. The available shop cards don't help much.\n\nBecause of Perkeo, I shouldn't buy more consumables.\n\nWith the shop analyzed, I think it's time to trigger Perkeo's effect by going to the next blind. No need for a reroll, as the current cards don't benefit. Since I am at Ante 6, the Boss Blind for Ante 6 is next. No point in lingering. Time to move on and let Perkeo get that Negative Jupiter. So, I will select `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
