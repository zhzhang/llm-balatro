{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Celestial Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 8/8, Round 21 – the final ante. The primary goal is clear: beat the Big Blind with 75,000 chips, and then the final Boss with likely 100,000 chips. I have $18 to work with. My deck is built around Flushes. Right now, I have a Flush at Level 13, which gives me 215 Chips and 28 Mult. My hand size is reduced by 2 due to the \"Stuntman\" joker.\n\nI just opened a Celestial Pack. My options are: Mars (Four of a Kind, the first option), Uranus (Two Pair, the second option), and Earth (Full House, the third option). None of them are Jupiter (Flush). My jokers (\"The Tribe\", \"Droll\", \"Ramen\", \"Stuntman\", and \"Brainstorm\") all synergize with Flushes. I also have \"Judgement\", a consumable.\n\nGiven the Flush-centric build and the Club-heavy deck (39/41 cards were clubs last round), I am *always* playing Flushes. If I'm forced to pivot, I want to consider which of these hands is most easily transitioned to (in order: Four of a Kind, Full House, Two Pair). I’m leaning towards the Four of a Kind (Mars). It does offer the highest stat gains of the options. However, even upgraded, Four of a Kind is much weaker than a Flush at this point. Since the Mars card (Four of a Kind) isn't a flush, it does not activate any bonuses. Regardless, I'll take it.\n\nThe plan is to select Mars. I will execute the action `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`. Now I am back in the shop. I will use the `select` action for pack card position 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
