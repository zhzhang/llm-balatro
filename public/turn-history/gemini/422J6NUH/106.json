{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy - Round 11**\n\nOkay, here we are in the shop, Round 11 with an Ante of 5. I've got $81, which is a decent chunk of change. Gotta think about maximizing that interest income, but I have plenty to spend. I'm focusing on Flushes, level 4, which is good. My inventory right now consists of Gros Michel (+15 Mult, 1/6 destroy), Egg ($31 sell value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult/x1.5 Mult on Flush, Polychrome), Perkeo (Copies consumable), and Blue Joker (+92 Chips). I'm also holding \"The Moon\", a consumable. The shop has Banner (+$30 chips/discard), Red Card (+3 Mult/skip pack), and \"The Sun\" (Converts to Hearts). And, most importantly, the Jumbo Buffoon Pack.\n\nThe goal is to get better Jokers or at least maintain the value I have. $81 is enough, and I need to avoid spending too much. I'll need to open the Jumbo Buffoon Pack: it's only $4. Banner's nice for chips, but I don't need *another* chip-generating joker. Red Card isn't relevant to my playstyle. \"The Sun\" is a total miss since I'm running Clubs with \"The Moon\". Egg's essentially a bank, and Perkeo is a huge asset for deck thinning and fixing with the \"The Moon\".\n\nMy first step is clearly to buy that Jumbo Buffoon Pack. I'll be down to $77. I'll be in good shape if I can find a Mult joker in the Buffoon Pack. Gros Michel is solid for now and so is Egg's high sell value. Perkeo triggers at the end of the shop, I should keep that in mind when I'm selling. The thing is, I already have 5 Jokers, so I'll need to sell one if I get a new one. Egg's the obvious choice for now, unless the new joker is *insanely* good.\n\nSo, the action is to buy the Jumbo Buffoon Pack. Let's see what we get! I need to keep in mind, I need to open the buffoon pack before anything else.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
