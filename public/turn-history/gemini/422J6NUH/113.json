{"reasoning":"**Shop Decision Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop, ante 5, round 11. I've got $68, which is pretty good. My primary strategy is a flush build focused on clubs, and Perkeo is the linchpin for maximizing \"The Moon\" (the consumable that converts cards to clubs). My Joker slots are full, so no space there.\n\n*   **Jokers:** Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg (Scaling Sell Value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Mult Polychrome), Perkeo (Copies consumable), Blue Joker (+92 Chips).\n*   **Consumables:** The Moon (converts 3 cards to Clubs) - this is *crucial*. I have 1/3 consumable slots filled.\n*   **Shop Cards:** I have Credit Card (Debt), Hanging Chad (Retrigger), and The Devil (Gold Card enhancement). I also have Overstock, Clearance Sale, and Reroll Surplus vouchers, but I'm not focused on them right now.\n\nMy immediate goal is to get a second \"The Moon.\" Perkeo copies a consumable at the end of the shop, and since \"The Moon\" is the only consumable right now, it will be the guaranteed copy.\n\nLet's break down the shop cards:\n\n*   **Credit Card:** No need. I have enough money, and the Egg will help me in a pinch.\n*   **Hanging Chad:** Not useful. Retriggering isn't valuable in my current setup, no Joker synergies to make it great.\n*   **The Devil:** Tempting, but dangerous. It converts a card to Gold. While Gold cards are good, the *risk* is that Perkeo might copy \"The Devil\" instead of \"The Moon.\" That's not acceptable! I want \"The Moon\" to be my only consumable.\n\nHere's my logic:\n\n1.  I need to decide between rerolling to find Jupiter or a better Joker (to eventually replace Gros Michel or Blue Joker), buying and consuming \"The Devil\", or going to the round select to get the Perkeo copy.\n\n2.  Rerolling is $5 and I've got $68, so I can afford it. Interest caps at $25, so I can spend down to $25 without a future problem.\n\n3.  Buying \"The Devil\" is out because I don't want Perkeo to copy it. Also, because it requires a target, I can't buy and use it in the shop, I need to have a card in hand which I do not.\n\n4.  I can `reroll_shop` - Rerolling is low risk for a high reward, and I can afford it.\n\nOkay, let's reroll. I'm aiming for Jupiter (for a flush) or a better Joker (to replace Gros Michel or Blue Joker). The current shop cards are not worth it. I'll reroll and keep only \"The Moon.\"\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
