{"reasoning":"**Rethinking the Shop in Ante 7**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, with $74 and a Flush-focused build. My current Jokers are Droll (polychrome, +10 Mult on Flush, X1.5 Mult), Ramen (X2 Mult, decreasing), The Tribe (X2 Mult on Flush), Perkeo (Duplicate consumable at end of shop), and Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size). I also have Jupiter (Level 5 Flush) as my only consumable. My strategy is set: flush focus, high-level flush, and infinite Jupiter scaling with Perkeo.\n\nThe shop itself isn't *quite* offering what I'd hoped for. Scholar gives +20 Chips and +4 Mult for Aces, but it doesn't fit my core Flush synergy or Stuntman's chip boost. Shoot the Moon (+13 Mult for Queens in hand, +10 Mult (Holo)) is even less relevant with the hand size reduction from Stuntman. Then there's Invisible Joker – After 2 rounds, sell to duplicate a random Joker. This is *very* interesting, especially since duplicating Perkeo, Tribe, or Stuntman would be huge. However, I have a full Joker board. I'd need to sell one.\n\nAt first, I discounted the Invisible Joker, but the more I think about it, the better it sounds. I have $74, and the reroll is $5. I can afford to risk.\n\nHere's the problem: Ramen is currently at X2 mult. Selling Ramen for Invisible Joker means a two-round wait. In Ante 7, with the Small Blind at ~20k-30k and the Big Blind at ~40k-50k, this is a risk. Let's see how much I can get if I use my current hand: Stuntman (+250) + Level 5 Flush + Droll (+10) + Tribe (X2) + Droll (X1.5). This comes out to (95 + 250) * (12 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 = 345 * 22 * 3 = 22,770, then with Ramen (X2), it's 45,540. If I sell Ramen, I might struggle to beat Big Blind/Boss in Ante 7.\n\nHowever, if Invisible Joker duplicates Tribe, I'd get X4 mult. Stuntman is +500 Chips. Perkeo would generate two Jupiters per round. Is it worth the risk of losing X2 mult (Ramen) for the next two rounds?\n\nI'm thinking, my setup is solid: Droll (Additive then Multiplicative), Ramen (Multiplicative), Tribe (Multiplicative). My current joker order is already fine for scoring.\n\nI'm safe to reroll. I need to keep the high-scoring build and focus on long-term scaling through Jupiter, or useful vouchers/tarots. I'll reroll and see what the shop yields.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
