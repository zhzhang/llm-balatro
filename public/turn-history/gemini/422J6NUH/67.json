{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment: Reroll for Maximum Perkeo Synergy**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in the shop, Ante 3, Round 7. I've got $61, a killer Joker set (Gros Michel, Egg, Droll, Perkeo, Crafty), and crucially, \"The Moon\" – a negative consumable. My main goal is to pump my Flush score as high as humanly possible before Perkeo triggers. Perkeo is the key here. It clones a random *negative* consumable at the end of the shop.\n\nThe current shop is: Astronomer - All planet cards and Celestial Packs in the shop are free.\n\nI have a full joker set and my hand levels are Flush Level 4, so I'm doing well so far.\n\nMy immediate thought is to milk Perkeo for all its worth and get negative \"Moons\" for deck conversion. The \"Moon\" is my engine, and I already have one so I can let Perkeo duplicate it. But wait, I have 4 consumable slots, and negative Moon doesn't use any.\n\nI could buy Astronomer for long-term scaling, but I need a Planet card to pair with Astronomer, or a good consumable to swap. I should reroll to maximize the chances of finding the perfect Planet card, preferably Jupiter (or a Celestial Pack), to have Perkeo copy *that* instead, for *insane* long-term scaling (+15 chips and +2 mult per shop visit). I can reroll multiple times, I have enough money. The Moon is good but Planet cards are better.\n\nThe plan is simple: I'll hold off on selling Egg. For now, the most logical and efficient move is to reroll the shop. Rerolling is only $6 and I have enough money to get me a Planet Card. That's it! Let's reroll. I need to make the shop as efficient as possible.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
