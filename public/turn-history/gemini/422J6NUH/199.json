{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop: Prioritizing the Arcana Pack**\n\nOkay, Ante 7, Round 16. Flush strategy is locked in with a solid Joker setup: Droll Joker, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, and Stuntman. My hand, though, needs some love: 10 Spades (Gold), A Clubs (Red Seal), A Clubs, 10 Clubs, 5 Clubs, and 2 Clubs. I'm flush-focused and want to keep Jupiter (lvl 5 Flush) scaling.\n\nPerkeo is the key here. The shop will reset and Perkeo clones a *negative* consumable at the end of the shop. I need to make sure Perkeo gets that Jupiter clone. \"The Devil\" is tempting for its immediate scoring, but I need to play the long game with Jupiter. Selling a Joker for the \"Golden Ticket\" doesn't make sense with my current build.\n\nThe Arcana Pack, however, feels like the play. It's cheap at $3 (and I have $84). It'll give me immediate utility. I'm hoping for a Planet card (Jupiter). Even a Hierophant or Empress could enhance what's in my hand right now. If it's something useless, I can use/discard to clear the consumable slot before the end of the shop, ensuring Perkeo targets Jupiter.\n\nI'm definitely buying the Arcana Pack first. There's no reason to take the risk on \"The Devil\" before seeing what's in the pack. \"Golden Ticket\" is out as well, no need to swap out a Joker. I will consider a reroll after seeing what's inside.\n\nThe action here is `buy_booster` at position `1` (Arcana Pack).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
