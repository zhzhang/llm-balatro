{"reasoning":"**Ante Up: Strategic Shop Selection**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. We're at Ante 4, aiming for that Boss Blind with a hefty 20,000 chip requirement. With $33 in the bank, and a decent Joker setup, the pressure is on. My current Jokers are Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($28 value), Droll Joker (Flush +10 Mult, x1.5, Polychrome x1.5), Perkeo (consumable copier), and Blue Joker (+92 chips). I also have two negative \"Moon\" consumables, just what I want.\n\nSo, the shop: \"Scholar\" isn't appealing, giving a flat +20 chips and +4 Mult for Aces—not worth replacing anything. \"The Lovers\" is a Tarot, possibly useful, but not a priority. A \"Standard Pack\" is usually for thinning the deck, but I'm fine with clubs with \"The Moon\". \"Magic Trick\" Voucher is underwhelming. I'm prioritizing consistency and bankroll.\n\nScoring-wise, with a Level 4 Flush (80 chips, 10 mult) and the current Jokers, I'm easily clearing the boss blind with about 13,500 per hand. I have a very strong setup and two hands should clear the 20k. The \"Egg\" will boost my earnings each round and Perkeo will consistently copy \"The Moon\". The goal here is long-term scaling, not a flashy quick win.\n\nMy reroll is currently at $4. I could reroll one more time to fish for a Planet pack or Jupiter but I'm not sure if it is worth the gamble. I'm above the $25 threshold for interest.\n\nThe tricky part: if I buy \"The Lovers\", Perkeo might make a negative copy of it instead of \"The Moon\". Definitely not. I want that consistent \"Moon\" generation. But, if I stay at $33, I can get $5 interest. \n\nOkay, I think I will `round_select` to bank on the interest. With a solid setup and the \"Perkeo\" trigger lined up for a free \"Moon\" copy, there's no need to take a risk. The current Joker arrangement is optimal (Gros Michel first). I'm not messing with it, and it's all set to go.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
