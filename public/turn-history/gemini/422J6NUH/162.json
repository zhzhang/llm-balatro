{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Perkeo & The Moon**\n\nOkay, so the game state is: ante 6, round 14 (small blind incoming), $19 in the bank. The plan is to build around Flushes, specifically Clubs because \"The Moon\" tarot card and Perkeo's synergy are key. I've got a good Joker setup: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Egg ($40 sell value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Polychrome), Perkeo (copies consumables), and Blue Joker (+94 Chips). All Joker slots are full.\n\nThe critical piece is Perkeo. I have \"The Moon\" (Negative). Perkeo creates a *negative* copy of a consumable at the end of the shop. I only have one consumable slot open. My goal is to let Perkeo copy \"The Moon\". This will let me reliably convert cards to Clubs. I want *two* \"The Moons\".\n\nLooking at the shop, the choices are: \"The Empress\" (enhance cards), \"Hanging Chad\" (retriggers first card played), and \"Bootstraps\" (+2 Mult per $5). \"The Empress\" could be good for building, but I can't guarantee Perkeo hits \"The Moon\" if I have another consumable in hand. \"Hanging Chad\" sounds useful with Blue Joker and Droll, but I don't want to sell a Joker to fit it in. It's not essential. \"Bootstraps\" gives me a bit of Mult based on my current money, but I'm trying to conserve cash and focus on this Club build.\n\nI've already rerolled a few times, and the cost is now $5. I need to make sure I have enough money for any high-value cards, but really I'm just trying to get out of the shop and let Perkeo do its work. Oh, I picked up \"The Blank\" voucher, which is good. There's not really anything in the shop to significantly improve my Flush build without ditching a joker. Selling Egg for $40 is a potential option for an emergency, but not for these shop cards.\n\nRight now, the plan is to end the shop with \"The Moon\" in my inventory and trigger Perkeo to make a copy.\n\nShould I rearrange the Jokers? Let's see... Gros Michel, Egg, Droll, Perkeo, Blue Joker. Scoring goes from left to right, cards first. +Mult should precede xMult. Actually, Droll Joker *is* Polychrome! The sequence is optimal now: (+15 from Gros), (+10 from Droll) then (x1.5 from Droll).\n\nI have $19 and the reroll is $5. I can afford one more reroll, but my priorities are set: let Perkeo do its thing, copy \"The Moon\", and get out.\n\n\"The Empress\" is useless because I can't use it in the shop since I don't have cards to select. It requires cards to target. Also, buying \"The Empress\" will stop Perkeo from picking \"The Moon\".\n\nI'm done with this shop. Time to go to `round_select` and trigger Perkeo. Yes, I checked: Perkeo creates a Negative copy, so I'll get two Negative \"The Moons\". Great for converting cards to Clubs! Should I sell the Egg? No, $40 is great and it's growing. It's a solid safety net.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
