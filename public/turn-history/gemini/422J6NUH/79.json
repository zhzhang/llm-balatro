{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Making the Best Decision**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 4, Round 8, with $26 in the bank. Our Flush build is going strong, especially with those Club conversions from The Moon and the potential for even more with Perkeo. Right now, interest is at the cap, giving me $5 per round.\n\nLooking at the shop, neither Saturn nor 8 Ball are relevant to my current strategy. Standard Booster Packs might be okay for consistency, but with the suit conversion engine already running, they're not urgent. Rerolling the shop for $7 is a definite no-go. That would drop my cash to $19, and the interest would drop down to $3, a loss of $2.\n\nI've got a solid Flush hand level already, and the Jokers are contributing well. Gros Michel boosts Multi, Egg will become a big money-maker, Droll Joker adds Multi, Perkeo duplicates a negative consumable, and Crafty Joker provides some nice chip output.\n\nSo, the shop cards are useless, booster packs are a gamble, and rerolling is a money-loser. The most logical move is definitely `round_select` to advance to the next blind.\n\nWait, should I grab the Mega Standard Pack? It's $6, so I'd have $20 left, and I'd still be getting $4 interest. While it might give me an even better card, I don't need the extra help with suit fixing, especially with Perkeo churning out more The Moons. Selling Egg or Crafty Joker is not worth it, either.\n\nAlright, double-checking Perkeo again: a negative copy of a consumable card at the end of the shop. This happens when I exit the shop.\n\nOkay, final answer: the action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
