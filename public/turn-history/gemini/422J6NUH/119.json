{"reasoning":"**Current shop, time to make a move.** Okay, here we are, Ante 5, Round 11. I've got $46, which is a nice cushion. My hand is set up for Flushes, level 4 thanks to Pluto. I've got \"The Moon\" which is key, a Negative copy thanks to Perkeo's effect, which is awesome for stacking them! The shop offers \"Death\" (which isn't useful for my current strategy since I don't have good cards to discard) and a \"Lusty Joker\" (useless for Clubs-focused build).\n\nSo, do I reroll? I've already isolated \"The Moon\", which Perkeo will copy when I leave the shop. I could go to the next round, but the shop's weak. With $46 and $8 reroll, there's a strong opportunity cost for *not* finding a Planet (like Jupiter) or a better joker. Max interest is at $25, so I am good. I'm thinking of \"reroll_shop\". It's a high level play.\n\nI also have Overstock, Clearance Sale and Reroll Surplus (2). I have 5 Jokers in total. But the current options in the shop are Death ($2) and Lusty Joker ($4). These are not helpful to my Flush build.\n\nI keep reviewing my Jokers to see if any are worth selling. Gros Michel gives +15 Mult. Blue gives +92 chips. Egg is a bank account ($31). Droll gives +10 mult for Flush. And Perkeo creates consumable copies.\n\nSince Death is in the shop, I shouldn't try buying that since it requires targets. Lusty Joker would be a bad idea for the same reason. Also, Perkeo.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that I must `reroll_shop`.\n\nI just need to execute `reroll_shop` now.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
