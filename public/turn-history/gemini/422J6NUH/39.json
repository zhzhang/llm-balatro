{"reasoning":"**Reroll for Perkeo Activation**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop. My current situation is that I have $11. Perkeo is in play, but it needs a consumable at the end of the shop to generate a negative copy. The shop has no consumables, just Jokers and a Buffoon Pack.  I'm thinking that the Buffoon Pack won't help, as it provides Jokers, not consumables. The Reroll Surplus voucher could be useful, but not for this specific problem.\n\nThe key here is Perkeo. Without a consumable, it's useless this round. The only real solution is to reroll the shop, which costs $5. If I reroll, I'll have $6 remaining. With $6, I can *potentially* find a Planet or Tarot card and buy it for around $3, thus activating Perkeo. This is my best chance to actually use Perkeo's ability this round.\n\nI've got my Jokers lined up (Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, Delayed Gratification). I've optimized their order as best as I can, with the Polychrome Droll Joker in the correct position for multiplicative bonus to trigger after any additive bonuses. I have no other options at this point. I've considered buying the Buffoon pack and found that I cannot.\n\nTherefore, the most logical action is to reroll the shop. This is the only way to try and get a consumable to activate Perkeo.\n\nI'll execute action: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
