{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization: Flush Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop phase of Round 13, with an Ante of 5. The goal is clear: beat Ante 5. Currently, I've got $36 in the bank, and my Joker setup is looking solid: Gros Michel for a nice mult boost (though there's that 1/6 destroy chance hanging over me), Egg for passive income, Droll Joker for Flush scaling, Perkeo which is key, and Blue Joker adding some chip power. My Flush hand is already at Level 4. The Moon consumable is active.\n\nThe shop presents some interesting choices. The priority is to maximize Flush scoring and ensure that Perkeo is leveraged to copy the Moon. The shop has: Superposition which is useless for my Flush deck, Green Joker, Mr. Bones (decent but not essential), a Jumbo Arcana Pack, and a Celestial Pack. I have vouchers for Overstock, Clearance Sale, and Reroll Surplus (but Reroll will not be helpful).\n\nI know I can buy both the packs with my current funds. The packs are the best way to improve hand levels. Buying packs first is key.\n\nMy initial thought was to buy the Celestial Pack first. However, the Jumbo Arcana Pack could offer more choices (5 cards), including a Hermit for money or Temperance, which would be *massive* with the Egg, increasing its sell value. Although Jupiter is unlikely in the Arcana Pack, but it could contain a new consumable. Also, Perkeo will create a new Moon every shop visit if I keep The Moon in my consumables.\n\nI've got to weigh this carefully. Selling Gros Michel is not currently a viable option. But the scaling of Green Joker isn't amazing for a low hand count strategy.\n\nThe decision: **Buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack (position 1)**.\n\nThe final action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
