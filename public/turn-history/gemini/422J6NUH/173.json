{"reasoning":"**Current Round Strategy: Leveling Up Flushes**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 15, ante 6, and it's time to choose a card from this Jumbo Celestial Pack. I've got $115 to work with. My primary goal is to maximize the Flush level by leveraging Perkeo to clone Jupiters. Currently, I have one Jupiter (Flush lvl 4) in my inventory.\n\nThe options are: Neptune (Straight Flush lvl 3), Mercury (Pair lvl 2), Mars (Four of a Kind lvl 2), Uranus (Two Pair lvl 1), and Venus (Three of a Kind lvl 4). Since I can't get more Jupiters here, the question is what's the next best move? Neptune, even if it's for a Straight Flush which I'm not currently aiming for, offers the highest raw stats increase. I know that Straight Flushes can include Flushes, but leveling the Straight Flush doesn't level the basic Flush. But getting any level up is better than skipping. It seems like selecting Neptune won't interfere with the Jupiter in my inventory, which is good.\n\nI need to quickly check the joker order again before I forget. It was: Gros Michel (+15 Mult), Droll Joker (+10 Mult, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo, Blue Joker (+94 Chips), Ramen (x2 Mult). I need to make sure I am optimizing my order. Let's do a quick calculation.\n\nChips are added first, then Mults. +Mults should be before xMults.\n*   Gros Michel: +15\n*   Droll Joker: +10 and x1.5\n*   Ramen: x2\n\nSo the ideal order looks like this: (Gros Michel + Droll Joker) -> (Droll Joker x1.5) -> (Ramen x2). Blue Joker, as a chip bonus, doesn't need to be first. So this means:\n\n1.  Blue Joker (chips, independent)\n2.  Gros Michel (+15 Mult)\n3.  Droll Joker (+10 Mult and x1.5 Mult)\n4.  Ramen (x2 Mult)\n5.  Perkeo (Utility)\n\nThis is a good order.\n\nI'm in the `PLANET_PACK` step, and I have to select a card before rearranging the jokers. Given the options, Neptune is clearly the best. I need to make sure I don't use my Jupiter before Perkeo has a chance to clone it. The Booster pack means the card is used immediately, so no worries.\n\nSo, I need to send the `select` action with `1` as the argument, referencing Neptune. It's the most valuable level-up option. Let's send that action.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
