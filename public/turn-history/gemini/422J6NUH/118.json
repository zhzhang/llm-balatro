{"reasoning":"**Focusing on Perkeo's Moon Duplication**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. I'm in the SHOP phase of Round 11, with $46. My primary strategy hinges on using Perkeo to duplicate \"The Moon\" consumable, which is Negative.  Right now, my consumables are \"The Moon\" and \"Pluto\". I *need* \"The Moon\" to be the *only* consumable when I leave this shop so Perkeo guarantees a copy of it.\n\nI just bought and \"used\" \"The Fool,\" which was supposed to have leveled up a High Card using Pluto (which was the previously used planet card). However, \"Pluto\" is showing up as a consumable in my inventory. It seems the `buy_and_use_consumable` command for \"The Fool\" actually *created* Pluto and placed it in my inventory.  The command's description confirms this – it buys a consumable, but not necessarily uses it. It seems I then need to explicitly *use* the planet card using the `use_consumable` action.\n\nThe shop offers Death ($2) and Lusty Joker ($4), but I'm not interested in either. A reroll is available for $8, which I can afford, but first, I need to deal with this \"Pluto\" card.\n\nMy immediate action is clear: I need to use \"Pluto\" to free up the consumable slot, guaranteeing that Perkeo duplicates \"The Moon\". I will use the `use_consumable` command with position 2 (where Pluto is). After I use Pluto, I will check the shop one more time to see if the reroll is worth it.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
