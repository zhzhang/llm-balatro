{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nAlright, final ante, boss blind – it's all about maximizing score! The shop phase is critical. I've got $43, and the Overstock Plus voucher is staring me in the face. It's a no-brainer because it adds a permanent shop slot, increasing my odds of finding those crucial planet cards. I'm running a Flush/Straight Flush build, so Jupiter is the dream.\n\nI've got $43, voucher is $7, so I'll be left with $36 to play with after. Rerolls cost $3 thanks to Reroll Surplus – I can get some rerolls in. Jokers are strong, so maybe I'll find something better, unlikely at this point.\n\nThe first step is to buy the voucher (position 1). This is to immediately unlock a shop slot, and let me get a better selection.\n\nMy current consumables are Neptune. Perkeo will copy Neptune *at the end of the shop*. No, I shouldn't use it now. Must hold.\n\nI've checked the shop cards – Earth and Mad Joker. Useless.\n\nOkay, let's confirm the voucher action: `buy_voucher`, position 1. The JSON checks out. And my cash is sufficient.\n\nMy current joker order looks optimal for my build: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, Stuntman. The multiplicative jokers (Ramen, The Tribe) follow the additive mult (Droll). Perkeo and Stuntman placement doesn't matter much.\n\nBefore I commit to buying that voucher, do I have any other options? I can't use Neptune yet. No, nothing else is worth considering. This is the optimal play.\n\nTime to execute!\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_voucher\", \"positions\": [1]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
