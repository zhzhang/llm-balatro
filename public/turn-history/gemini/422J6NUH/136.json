{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Balatro Shop for Optimal Play**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5, Round 12, the Big Blind. I've got $25, which is perfect for maintaining maximum interest. Looking at the shop, I have a Gros Michel (+15 Mult), an Egg ($34 sell value), a Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Polychrome), Perkeo (Copies consumable as Negative), and a Blue Joker (+94 Chips). The only consumable I have is \"The Moon\" (Negative, converts 3 cards to Clubs).\n\nI just used Mercury and Earth to clear out my consumables. My consumables slot count is 3 (2 base, +1 from Perkeo, 0 from \"The Moon\"), and I have no other consumables besides the negative \"The Moon,\" so my capacity is fine.\n\nThe Empress is in the shop, and a regular Joker. Buying \"The Empress\" wouldn't work; Perkeo might copy it instead of \"The Moon,\" and I'd prefer a consistent Club conversion. The regular Joker is a simple +4 Mult, but my Joker slots are already full at 5/5, so it's a no-go. Rerolling is too expensive, and I'd lose interest.\n\nThe key play here is Perkeo. Since \"The Moon\" is my only consumable, Perkeo *will* copy it. I want that consistency for building Flushes.\n\nI have to move to the blind. The action is `round_select`.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let's make sure my Jokers are in the right order. Scoring order: 1. Play Cards, 2. Jokers (Left to Right, addition first, multiplication after).\n\nMy current order is: Gros Michel (+15), Egg, Droll Joker (+10 Flush, x1.5), Perkeo, Blue Joker (+Chips). The +15 should go before the +10 and the x1.5 because addition should come before mult. This order is perfect because the chip gain from the Blue Joker is not based on a multiplier.\n\nLooking at recent hands, I need a high score to pass this Ante. A Flush is my best bet.\n\nSo, 10 Mult (Flush Lvl 4) + 15 (Gros Michel) + 10 (Droll) * 1.5 (Droll Polychrome) = ~52.5 Mult. With about 240 chips from the cards and Blue Joker, a Flush could score roughly 12,600. I might need 2 hands.\n\nI'm definitely not buying anything. I'm going to `round_select` to trigger Perkeo to duplicate \"The Moon\" so I can make as many Flushes as possible.\n\n**Action: `round_select`.**\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
