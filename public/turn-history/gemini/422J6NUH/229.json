{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy for Overcoming The Flint**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 18, and The Flint is coming up – the one that halves both my base chips and multiplier. Currently sitting on $68, and the goal is to maximize my Flush score to survive this boss blind. I'm running a pretty solid Flush setup with Droll Joker, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, and Stuntman. My immediate focus is on leveraging Perkeo and Jupiter.\n\nI've got the Perkeo + Jupiter engine ready to go. Jupiter is the only consumable I have, and Perkeo will copy it at the end of the shop. I already sold the Hanged Man to guarantee Perkeo copies Jupiter. My current Flush level is 8, and I need to get it as high as possible.\n\nThe shop has Hanging Chad (meh) and Earth (completely useless since I'm playing Flushes). My reroll cost is a cheap $4, and I have plenty of cash. While I don't strictly *need* more Jupiters to set up the Perkeo trigger, buying and using them *now* is a good play. The most important thing is to *not* add any other consumables that would dilute the Perkeo pool.\n\nI could reroll, hoping for more Jupiters to buy and use, or maybe a good voucher (\"Planet Merchant\" or \"Telescope\" would be nice, though unlikely). Since I have so much money and The Flint is coming, I think it's time for some rerolls.\n\nThe specific interaction between Perkeo and Jupiter is a key element of the current strategy. Rerolling is the most logical step to scale the flush level to get a higher score. It's time to roll the shop.\n\nI'm definitely going to reroll the shop for Jupiter or a voucher. My priority is to beef up my Flush level as much as possible before The Flint cuts my score in half.\n\nI'll `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
