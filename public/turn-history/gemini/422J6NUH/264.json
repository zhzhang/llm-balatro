{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Joker Setup for Maximum Flush Score**\n\nOkay, Ante 8, Round 20, the final ante push. Let's see how to squeeze the most points out of this hand. I've got $24, and the SHOP phase is here. The immediate goal is to absolutely maximize my Flush score with these Jokers.\n\nI have: Droll Joker (+10 Mult if Flush, x1.5 Mult polychrome), Ramen (x2 Mult, loses X0.01 per discard), The Tribe (x2 Mult if Flush), Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size), and Brainstorm (Copies leftmost Joker). Plus, Judgement consumable.\n\nBrainstorm is key here. It's in slot 5, and it copies the leftmost Joker. Right now, that's the Droll Joker. If I stick with the current arrangement, the calculation is: (26 + 10 + 10) * 1.5 * 1.5 * 2 * 2, which equals 414 Mult. Not bad, but we can do better.\n\nIf I rearrange it so Brainstorm copies the Tribe instead, things get interesting. Let's consider putting The Tribe at position 1. And also, since position 1 is now taken, move it over.  If I recalculate, putting The Tribe in position 1, I get: (26 + 10) * 1.5 * 2 * 2 * 2, which equals 432 Mult. That's better! This tells me to rearrange.\n\nNow, wait a minute, Brainstorm *always* copies the *leftmost* joker. I need The Tribe to be leftmost. So I need to move The Tribe to position 1. That means I need the rearrange action. Let me see - to get the Tribe to position 1, the rearrange should be `rearrange_jokers 3 1 2 4 5`. (or anything where 3 is the first number).\n\nI've also got the Judgement consumable, but I'm at 5/5 Jokers. Either use it (after selling a joker) or sell it. Is there a better Joker I can buy? Let's quickly review what I have: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Stuntman, and Brainstorm. This is a solid setup, especially with a strong Flush hand. I am feeling confident here. Maybe I can reroll to search for Jupiter, but for now I want to maximize my current setup, given the ante level.\n\nSo, the optimal move is clear: get The Tribe in position 1, so that Brainstorm copies it. That results in the highest multiplier for the Flush. It's a simple, targeted goal.\n\n**Final action**: `rearrange_jokers [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [3,1,2,4,5]"}
