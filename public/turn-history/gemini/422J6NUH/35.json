{"reasoning":"Okay, here's the plan. I'm in Ante 2, Round 4, facing the Boss Blind, \"The Hook.\" This is the one that forces me to play only one hand this round. The goal is 800 chips. I have $1 currently. My Jokers are: Gros Michel (+15 Mult, 1/6 destroy), Egg (Gains $3 sell value/round), Droll Joker (+10 Mult if Flush, x1.5 Mult Polychrome), Perkeo (Negative consumable copy), and Delayed Gratification ($2/discard if none used). I also have the Clearance Sale voucher.\n\nI've already figured out that a Flush would be an easy win – around 5,445 chips! Even a Three of a Kind would likely hit the 800 chip target. Given that I'm at `BLIND_SELECT`, `play_round` is the only sensible command.\n\nBefore I commit to playing, I need to confirm the Joker order. The critical order for Droll Joker is that the +Mult happens *before* the Polychrome multiplier. The current order – Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, Delayed Gratification – is correct. The +Mult from Gros Michel and Droll Joker are applied, then the Polychrome x1.5 is applied to that total.\n\nDelayed Gratification is a bit of a trap. It gives me $2 for each discard I *don't* use. However, the boss condition is *play only one hand*, not no discards. So, it's worth discarding to hunt for a strong hand – a Flush or Three of a Kind. I need to be sure I hit that 800 chip target in this single hand.\n\nMy hand currently has a pair of Kings. That's only going to score around 510 chips, not enough. I'm going to have to discard to look for a better hand.\n\nSo, the action is `play_round`. I need to generate a JSON response. The `action` is \"play\\_round,\" `positions` will be `null` because I'm just playing, `intended_hand_type` is `null` until I see my new hand, and `estimated_chips` is `null`.\n\nLet's do this. I'm hitting `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
