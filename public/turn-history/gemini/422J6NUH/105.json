{"reasoning":"**Current Decision: Prioritizing Economic Dominance**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the SHOP phase, specifically inside a Jumbo Arcana Pack. My primary goal is long-term survival and, of course, maximizing my chip output. Currently, I'm sitting on $36, and the options before me are pretty interesting. I've got some solid Jokers in my inventory: Gros Michel, Egg, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and Blue Joker. I also have \"The Moon\" as a consumable.\n\nThe card choices in this pack are: The Hanged Man, The Chariot, Death, Temperance, and Justice. After a quick look, the best move here is clearly *Temperance*. It's sitting at position 4. It offers a sell value equal to the combined value of all my Jokers, which I've confirmed. Right now, it's worth a massive $45. This is *huge* at Ante 5, basically, it is the best play I can make.\n\nI could consider *Death* to manipulate my hand, especially to try and create more bonus cards, or focus the deck on a specific suit, but $45 now is far more valuable than a slight upgrade to my hand. This will give me $81 total, which will allow me to buy everything else in the shop, re-roll, and build interest.\n\nI've already triple-checked everything. The command is `select <pack_card_position>`. Temperance is position 4. And the card is used immediately.\n\nMy hand right now is: 10 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs (Bonus), 9 of Clubs (Bonus), 9 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs (generates a planet), 5 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, and 8 of Diamonds.\n\nThe Hanged Man might be useful down the line, but isn't as critical as this economy boost. The Chariot is good, but doesn't synergize as well with this deck. Death is tempting, but Temperance is still better than manipulating one or two cards in my hand at this stage. Justice isn't ideal because it has a chance to break. Temperance has no risk.\n\nI need to sell Temperance immediately.\n\nSo, I'm executing `select 4`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
