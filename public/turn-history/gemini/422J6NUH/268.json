{"reasoning":"**Rethinking the Final Ante**\n\nOkay, here we are: Ante 8, Round 20, the final ante. Shop time. Let's see what we've got. I have $22 and a decent joker setup: a Flush-focused build. I have The Tribe (X2 flush multiplier), Droll ( +10, Polychrome x1.5), Ramen (x2, small discard penalty), Stuntman (+250 chips), and Brainstorm (copies The Tribe). My Flush is Level 12 (200 Chips, 26 Mult) and has been played 25 times.\n\nLooking at the shop, Pluto (High Card Level), Devious Joker (+100 Chips), Faceless Joker (earn $) and Supernova (Mult based on times played, +25). Pluto is useless to me. Devious, and Faceless aren't useful either. Supernova is the only one that *might* have some interest. Since Flush is at 25 times played, that is +25 Mult.\n\nLet's do some quick math. My current total Mult is roughly (26 Base + 10 Droll) * 1.5 Polychrome * 2 * 2 * 2 = 432. If I swap out Droll for Supernova, it would be (26 Base + 25 Supernova) * 2 * 2 * 2 = 408. Droll is better because of the Polychrome X1.5. Swapping any other Joker would be a *massive* downgrade.\n\nThe goal here is still Jupiter (Flush Level) or a good Tarot, Spectral joker, something to help me scale or get money. I'm sitting on $22, and a reroll costs $8. I can afford a couple rerolls. I've already rerolled twice already. Is it worth it to try again at this point? This is the final ante, the Boss is coming up. I need to be as strong as possible, and my score is currently 87k from the last round. I should check the boss' score threshold. The Wall is 720k, and the Violet Vessel is 1.2M.\n\nOkay, Ante 8, Round 20, money $22. I can afford two more rerolls ($8, then $9). Given that the current shop is useless, and the boss round is coming up, one more reroll is reasonable to try and find a Jupiter or a useful Spectral joker. Let's do it.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
