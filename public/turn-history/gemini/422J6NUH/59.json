{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization: Round 7, Ante 3**\n\nOkay, here we are in the shop phase of Ante 3, Round 7. I've got $81 to work with, a decent starting point. Let's see, my current Joker lineup is pretty solid: Gros Michel is a potential game-changer with that +15 Mult and destroy chance, Egg is slowly accruing value and currently at $19, Droll Joker is my Flush multiplier engine, Perkeo is a Legendary, and Delayed Gratification is just sitting there. I've also got \"The Moon\" consumable, which is *perfect* for a Flush build.\n\nMy top priority is to set up my deck for maximum effectiveness going forward, I have 5/5 jokers and 1/3 consumables.\n\nRight, the shop has Seltzer, which is a fantastic retrigger for 10 hands, and a Mega Arcana Pack. Seltzer is *temping*, but I only have 5/5 Jokers, so I need to sell something to make use of it. Delayed Gratification isn't pulling its weight, and Egg has potential, but I like Gros Michel too.\n\nHold on, I have Perkeo! If I buy nothing else, Perkeo will duplicate \"The Moon\" consumable! That will be an *incredibly* strong combo for Flushes.\n\nI really like the idea of the Mega Arcana Pack. Tarot cards can make a massive difference in a build. I'm going to open that.\n\nI'm definitely going to buy the Mega Arcana Pack for $6. It's an obvious choice.\n\nOkay, let's see. The Seltzer is the tempting one here. Retriggering is so powerful in this game, especially if I can score a good hand. If I want Seltzer, I need to ditch a Joker. My options are Egg, Gros Michel, or Delayed Gratification. Egg at $19 is worth more than the discard, Gros Michel is too much fun to get rid of, and Delayed Gratification is useless.\n\nBefore I think any more about Seltzer, let's open that Mega Arcana Pack and see what we get. There's really no reason to *not* buy it now.\n\nOkay, so the order of operations: `buy_booster 1`. Let's see what's inside.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
