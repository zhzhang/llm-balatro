{"reasoning":"**Current Turn Strategy: Shop Optimization**\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. I'm in the shop, Ante 7, with $78. The goal is still maxing out Flush scores, and I've got a strong foundation with my current jokers: Droll Joker (essential for the Flush Mult boost), Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo (crucial for duplicating Jupiter), and Stuntman for chips. I'm holding Jupiter, ready for Perkeo's trickery.\n\nThe shop offers are… underwhelming: Uranus (Two Pair - nope), Luchador (boss disabler, *maybe* useful later), and Ice Cream (+100 Chips, which I don't really need with Stuntman). I'm not going to sell a Joker for something in the shop right now.\n\nMy Joker order is optimized: Droll's +10 Mult triggers *before* the X Mult effects of Ramen and The Tribe, maximizing the score. Stuntman's chip boost doesn't matter for order.\n\nNow, the main thing: Perkeo. I want that negative Jupiter! The best play is to leave the shop with Jupiter in hand. Then it'll create a negative.\n\nI can afford a few rerolls. Given my discount from Clearance Sale and Reroll Surplus, I should definitely keep looking. I'm searching for:\n\n1.  Vouchers (Planet Merchant, Telescope, etc.).\n2.  More Jupiter cards (for an immediate play).\n3.  A better Joker (though the current set is pretty great).\n\nSo, the optimal move is clear: reroll the shop. I'll provide the JSON: `{\"action\": \"reroll_shop\"}`. Reroll, reroll, reroll!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
