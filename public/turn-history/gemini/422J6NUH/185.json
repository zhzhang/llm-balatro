{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization: The Reroll Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 6, $95 in the bank. I've got a solid Joker lineup: Droll, Perkeo, Blue, Ramen, and Flash. The strategy is clear: maximize Flush scaling. Droll gives +10 mult and then multiplies by 1.5, Flash gains +2 mult per reroll, and Jupiter levels up the Flush. Perkeo is the wildcard, creating a *negative* copy of a consumable. I need to keep the original Jupiter for maximum benefit.\n\nThe key is Joker order: chips before mult, and additive mult before multiplicative mult. Let me get that perfect. I've been calculating the optimal Joker order: Blue Joker (chips), Flash Card, Droll Joker, Perkeo, and then Ramen. Okay, it's: 3, 5, 1, 4, 2. I have 3, 1, 2, 4, 5. So it will be: 3, 5, 1, 4, 2! I've rerolled once, and Flash went from 0 to +2. Good start.\n\nThe current reroll cost is $9, and I want to stay above $25 for max interest. The shop items are Hack (not for me), Superposition (eh, too inconsistent), and Arrowhead (only helps spades, not worth it). I don't want to sell a Joker just for shop cards.\n\nShould I rearrange or reroll first? Rerolling changes the shop, and I should rearrange the Jokers before the round starts for optimal scoring. Rerolling first. The reasoning is clear, scale the Flash Card, then rearrange for perfect play. Since rearranging is free and doesn't affect the shop, and since Flash card scales up in mult, it is correct to *reroll* again.\n\n$95, $9 reroll, let's keep going. Reroll! Let's hit Jupiter again! No danger to the strategy. Let's maximize this. The previous logic dictated I should keep rerolling, so let's keep it going. I can afford several more rerolls. I have to make sure Perkeo keeps copying Jupiter. Another reroll, here we go!\n\nOkay, time to make sure this is actually a valid action in the correct format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\"\n}\n```\n\nFinal check: Flash Card gains +2 mult per reroll. The strategy is scale mult before the hand! So. Let's do it! Let's do another reroll.\nThe cost will keep going up. Let's plan it out: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, I'm good until the 7th reroll! Okay, here we go, another reroll. I see this is a pattern: keep scaling. The goal is to scale the hand, scale the Joker. Let's keep that in mind: scale. Okay, I have a negative copy Jupiter.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
