{"reasoning":"**The Perfect Play**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante is at 3, we're in Round 6 (Small Blind). My primary goal here is to hit 2000 chips; I'm currently at 714, meaning I need 1286 more. I've only got 3 hands left, and 4 discards. I have $6 and have these Jokers: Gros Michel which gives +15 Multiplier (and a 1/6 chance of destruction), Egg which I can sell for $13 or get $3 a round, Droll Joker which gives +10 Multiplier if the hand is a flush and x1.5 Mult Polychrome, Perkeo which is Legendary (Negative copy of consumable in shop), and Delayed Gratification, which nets $2 per discard if none are used.\n\nMy hand: 10 of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds. I have a flush staring me in the face with six hearts (10, 9, 5, 5, 3, 2). Playing a Flush (Level 3) gives a base of 65 chips and 8 multiplier. I should select the five highest-scoring hearts: 10, 9, 5, 5, 3. The card values add up to 32 chips, giving a total of 97 chips.\n\nThe multipliers are key here: base is 8, plus Gros Michel's +15, plus Droll Joker's +10 because it's a flush. That's a total additive multiplier of 33, which is then multiplied by Droll Joker's Polychrome bonus of x1.5, to 49.5 multiplier. My score will be 97 (chips) * 49.5 (multiplier) = 4801.5. Since the target is 2000 chips, and the current total is 714, this play should win the round immediately.\n\nI need to make the right move: playing this Flush now guarantees victory within the required hands. Importantly, it lets me keep my discards, getting me $8 from Delayed Gratification. I have 3 hands left. So, playing the flush uses 1 hand (total 2 hands used), which maximizes money from hands and discards.\n\n**Action: `play`**\n\nMy intention is to play positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (10H, 9H, 5H, 5H, 3H) – a Flush of Hearts. Estimated total chips: 4801.\n\n**Finally, let's verify my calculated output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 4801\n}\n```\nThis is a clean, parseable JSON object – ready for execution.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
