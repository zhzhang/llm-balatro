{"reasoning":"**The Balatro Shop Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, Round 7. Got a solid Flush build going, level 4. Last hand crushed it with 7,875 chips. I've got $72, which is a nice cushion. Current Jokers are decent: Gros Michel for mult, Egg for cash generation, Droll Joker for Flush bonus, Perkeo (crucial) to copy consumables, and Delayed Gratification (meh, but free money). \"The Moon\" is the consumable, and I need to hang onto that, because it gets copied.\n\nLooking at the shop, *bleh*. Earth (Full House boost - useless) and Greedy Joker (Diamonds boost - counterproductive since I'm Clubs). No boosters, no vouchers I can use, and the reroll is a cheap $4. With my setup, I'm looking for Jupiter (Flush level up), Tarot cards to thin my deck, or better Jokers. Gros Michel is the only one I'd consider replacing.\n\nPerkeo is my key here. I want to reroll, find something amazing, and then have Perkeo make a Negative copy of \"The Moon\" at the *end* of the shop. However, I have already used a reroll this turn. The cost is now $4. I have enough money that I can afford several, even if I don't see anything I want. The interest cap is $25, so I'm already maxed out there.\n\nDo I *really* need to reroll? The next round is the Boss Blind, but I should easily beat it with my Flush. However, I want to scale up, especially since Perkeo is getting me a copy of \"The Moon\". If I get a good Celestial or Arcana pack, that could really help my build.\n\nSince I am at the end of the shop, I can't buy anything that will help me. I already tried a reroll. I could potentially round select but want to get Jupiter, or other helpful cards. I should try to get at least one more good reroll, since I have the money.\n\nSo, I'm going for one more reroll. Hopefully, something pops up that is worth the investment. It's a risk, but I am in a good position to take the risk.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
