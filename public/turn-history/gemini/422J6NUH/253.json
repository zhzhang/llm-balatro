{"reasoning":"**The Flush is the Play!**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante is 8/8, and we're on round 20. Small blind is up, needing 50,000 chips. We have 4 hands remaining and 5 discards. Let's see... the hand: Q♣, Q♣, 8♣, 5♣, 5♣, 3♣. That's a Flush, easy choice. I'll need to use those clubs to make it work.\n\nWe have some nice Jokers too. Droll Joker, which gives +10 mult and then doubles the score if it's a flush. Ramen, that's x2 mult and decreases per discard. The Tribe, which x2 mult if it's a flush, and Stuntman +250 chips at -2 hand size, and Perkeo for a negative copy.\n\nOur Flush is at Level 10, so base is 170 chips and 22 mult. Straight Flush is Level 8, but the Flush looks like the right play.\n\nChips wise: We're playing Q, Q, 8, 5, and 3 of Clubs, in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. So 170 base + 10+10+8+5+3 = 36 card chips, plus 250 from Stuntman is 456 total chips.\n\nFor mult: 22 base. Droll gives +10, so 32. Then its Polychrome/Edition effect, which is x1.5, making it 48. Ramen is x2, so 96. The Tribe is x2 for a Flush again, so 192. So the final score is 456 * 192 = 87,552. That's way more than the 50,000 we need.\n\nLet's quickly check the Joker activation order: Droll, Ramen, The Tribe, Perkeo, Stuntman. That's already correct since we want to hit the multipliers. We're good. It's Droll (+10, then x1.5), then Ramen (x2), then The Tribe (x2).\n\nAlright, I'm going to play that flush. Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and it should get us 87,552. I'll double-check: 170 + 36 + 250 = 456. Then 22 + 10 = 32. Then 32 * 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 192. So 456 * 192 = 87,552. Confirmed. Time to clear that blind!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,6]"}
