{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Evaluation: Round 15 Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: we're in Round 15 with an ante of 6. This is shop phase, and I've got $88 to work with. My primary goal, as always, is to maximize my Flush score, and the setup is getting *very* promising. I currently have 4 out of 5 Joker slots filled, and 1 out of 2 consumable slots utilized by Jupiter.\n\nMy existing Joker lineup is solid: Droll Joker (Flush Multiplier, +10 mult and x1.5 multiplier), Perkeo (crucial for copying Jupiter), Blue Joker (+94 Chips, deck dependent), and Ramen (x2 Mult). I just sold Flash Card, specifically to buy a certain card in this shop.\n\nMy options this shop are Smiley Face (+5 mult to face cards), The Tribe (crucial x2 Multiplier for Flushes, exactly what I need!), and Pluto (level up High Card).\n\nI *need* \"The Tribe\" (Position 2 in Shop). I've built around Flushes (Level 4, 18 times played), and this is a huge upgrade. The Flash Card was a necessary sacrifice. My fifth Joker slot is open, which is important for future acquisitions.\n\nThe plan is to buy \"The Tribe\". This will leave me with: Droll Joker, Perkeo, Blue Joker, Ramen, and The Tribe. I need to make sure to keep Jupiter consumable slot 1 open.\n\nI did a quick check on the cost; \"The Tribe\" is $6 due to Clearance Sale (8 * 0.75). I have $88, so this purchase will leave me with $82.\n\nMy next immediate action is clear: `buy_card 2`. This secures \"The Tribe,\" and I can optimize the Joker order later. The shop-phase goal is to secure The Tribe and to make sure Jupiter is not replaced or consumed this turn.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
