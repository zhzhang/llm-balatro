{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop Before the Next Round**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 7, Round 17. I've got $71. The immediate goal is to conquer the Ante 7 boss and start thinking about Ante 8. My core strategy revolves around a Flush build, currently at Level 6. The key here is to leverage Perkeo's ability to clone a consumable – specifically, I need to keep Jupiter in my hand so I can get negative Jupiter cards, which are invaluable for free Flush upgrades.\n\nMy Joker lineup is pretty solid: Droll Joker for polychrome mult and flush multiplier, Ramen for the discard multiplier, The Tribe for another flush multiplier, Perkeo for the cloning, and Stuntman for the chip boost (though the -2 hand size is a bit of a nuisance). I have Jupiter, which is what is needed for the cloning.\n\nThe shop itself isn't offering any game-changing Jokers. Runner, Castle, Abstract Joker… nothing that dramatically improves my current setup. The boosters, however, are interesting. The Arcana Pack is only $3, and considering my score is 51,840, which is near the target of 52,500, this could tip me over the edge to have a strong turn.\n\nI already bought the Mega Celestial Pack and got Saturn and Venus. The plan is to Perkeo's ability at the end of the shop, after the purchase. It's a risk-reward analysis here. I could see myself getting The Fool for another Jupiter, or useful card enhancements.\n\nMy current calculation is: Stuntman gives +250 chips. Flush base (Lvl 6) is 110 chips. Total chips ~360. Base mult 14 + Droll Joker 10 = 24. X-Mult is Droll Joker (x1.5), Ramen (x2), The Tribe (x2) for a total of x6. That's approximately 360 * 24 * 6 = 51,840.\n\n**The Arcana Pack is the move.** Let's see what the Tarot cards have in store for me, to make this flush even more potent. No using that Jupiter yet, though! The cloning is the priority.\n```\nbuy_booster 1\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
