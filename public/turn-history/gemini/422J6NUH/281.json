{"reasoning":"**Final Boss: Action Plan**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 8, facing the final boss, and it's time to strategize for this last round of Balatro. My primary objective is to exceed the 100,000 chip threshold, which should be easily achievable given my previous flush. Let's make sure I hit the numbers.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the boss. \"Forces 1 card to always be selected\". I had to backtrack there, but that description is **The Burial**. Okay, I need to remember that when playing.\n\nNow, let's analyze my hand. My current Joker lineup is: The Tribe (x2 Flush), Droll Joker (+10 Mult Flush, x1.5 Edition), Ramen (x2 Mult), Stuntman (+250 Chips, -2 hand size), and Brainstorm (Copies leftmost). I have The Judgement consumable, The Chariot consumable (Steel Card), and $6 left. Given my current chip counts, I can safely sell The Judgement to hit the maximum possible.\n\nThe core of my strategy is going to be maximizing the multiplier from my Jokers. I know that the most effective Joker setup is a flush hand with a solid base multiplier. I need to get the multiplier as high as possible.\n\nLet's do some math: Base Mult 28. Droll Joker, I remember, is most effective early. Current setup: 1: Tribe, 2: Droll, 3: Ramen, 4: Stuntman, 5: Brainstorm. The user wants to optimize the multipliers as much as possible, for a Flush hand.\n\n*   Current, default order is 1: Tribe, 2: Droll, 3: Ramen, 4: Stuntman, 5: Brainstorm. Brainstorm copies The Tribe (x2).\n    *   28 (base) * 2 (Tribe) + 10 = 56 + 10 = 66 * 1.5 = 99 * 2 = 198 * 2 = 396. Chips: 215 * 396 = 85,140\n\nLet's test other orders. What if, following the user's past actions, Droll is first?\n\n*   1: Droll Joker, 2: Tribe, 3: Ramen, 4: Stuntman, 5: Brainstorm. Brainstorm copies Droll (+10, x1.5).\n    *   28 (base) + 10 = 38 * 1.5 = 57 * 2 = 114 * 2 = 228 * 2 = 456. Chips: 215 * 456 = 98,400. Not ideal.\n\nIf Brainstorm copies a mult Joker, I am going to have the highest mult. I want the max mult with my best set.\n\n*   Current setup, with Brainstorm at end, copying the Tribe gives the highest mult, I believe. If Tribe is at 1, then Droll at 2, Ramen at 3, Stuntman at 4, Brainstorm copies Tribe for 396 mult.\n*   This matches my current setup: 1: Tribe, 2: Droll, 3: Ramen, 4: Stuntman, 5: Brainstorm. The Brainstorm copies The Tribe.\n*   I can also verify from the user's previous action, Droll 2, Tribe 1, Ramen 3.\n*   (28\\*2 + 10)\\*1.5\\*2\\*2=396.\n\nI should make the calculation clear. The formula is ((Base + Card Mults + Joker +Mults) * Joker xMults). So I have:\n\n*   Base Mult: 28.\n*   1st Joker: Tribe (x2). So 28\\*2=56.\n*   2nd Joker: Droll (10 + \\*1.5). 56+10=66\\*1.5=99.\n*   3rd Joker: Ramen (x2). 99\\*2=198.\n*   4th Joker: Stuntman (+250)\n*   5th Joker: Brainstorm. Copies Tribe (2x). So 198\\*2=396.\n\nGiven this calculation, my current joker order is optimal. I can confidently **play_round**.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
