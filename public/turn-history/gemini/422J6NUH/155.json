{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Assessment: Ante 6, Round 14**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. $40 in the bank, Ante 6, and I need to optimize this shop to build power. My Jokers are a solid base: Gros Michel (+15 Mult, risky but powerful), Egg (a cash cow at $40), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Mult), Perkeo (MVP for consumable duplication), and Blue Joker (+94 Chips). The Moon consumable will be crucial for manipulating the deck toward Clubs, thanks to Perkeo, and that Egg will come in handy.\n\nLooking at the shop, *Perkeo* is my key. I can buy The Moon, allowing consistent deck manipulation. The *Egg* is a safety net. The *Gros Michel* is a slight gamble, but it boosts a large amount of Mult. The *Droll Joker* and *Blue Joker* are strong.\n\n*Mars* and *Joker Stencil* are irrelevant here. *Red Card* is a scaling option, but I need a more immediate impact. I have enough money. The *Jumbo Arcana Pack* could be great for deck fixes or finding more consumables for Perkeo to copy, but the *Celestial Pack* is more of a priority. A *Blank Voucher* is a great long-term investment for an extra Joker slot, and I have enough capital to get it.\n\nMy priorities: I'm focusing on building my Flush and finding more consumables. This leads me to purchase the Celestial Pack ($3), looking for Jupiter. Then the Jumbo Arcana ($4) to hunt for consumables. Finally, the Blank Voucher ($7).\n\nI can afford this, so let's check to make sure my buy order is correct. I have $40. I will first buy the Celestial Pack, which will assist me in finding Jupiter. Then the Jumbo Arcana. Finally, the Blank Voucher.\n\nFirst, I need to check the boosters. I'll \"buy\\_booster\" in position \\[2]. The boosters are ready to go.\n\nCurrently, Flush Level 4 is 80 chips / 10 mult. The Jokers give +94 chips, +15 mult, (+10 mult, x1.5). Total score calculation: Base Chips: 80 + 94 = 174. Base Mult: 10 + 15 + 10 = 35. Total Mult: 35 * 1.5 = 52.5. Score: 174 * 52.5 = 9,135. Ante 6 Small Blind is usually around 11,000-15,000. Big is 20,000+. I might need a bit more power soon. Leveling Flush is the most direct way.\n\nWait a second, Perkeo activates *after* the shop. That means I need to buy the Celestial Pack first, *then* see what I can duplicate. Given that, I'm buying the Celestial Pack:\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
