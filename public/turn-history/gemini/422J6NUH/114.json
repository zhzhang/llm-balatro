{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Ante 5, Round 11**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking in this shop. I've got $63, and the ante is at 5. My primary goal is to optimize my Flush strategy, and I have a decent set-up already: Gros Michel (+15 Mult, with a 1/6 chance to break), Egg ($31 sell value), Droll Joker (+10 Mult for Flush, x1.5 Mult Polychrome), Perkeo (Legendary, copies 1 consumable at the end of the shop, +1 slot), and Blue Joker (+92 chips). I also have \"The Moon\" consumable, which converts 3 cards to Clubs, vital for my Flush gameplan.\n\nThe key here is Perkeo. I need \"The Moon\" to be the *only* consumable I have at the end of this shop so I can guarantee its duplication. This will give me a very reliable Club-focused deck.\n\nLooking at the shop, Loyalty Card ($4) is tempting (X4 Mult every 6 hands), but to take it, I'd have to sell a Joker (either Gros Michel or Blue Joker). Gros Michel is risky, and Loyalty Card is inconsistent. Pluto ($2) levels up High Card. The Star ($2) converts cards to Diamonds, which would destroy my suit focus.\n\nI've decided on an action that won't disrupt my Perkeo strategy: `buy_and_use_consumable 2`, which is Pluto. It's cheap, gives a small benefit to my base hand, and importantly, doesn't mess with my consumable inventory.\n\nI should *not* buy \"The Star\" because it requires targeting cards, and the command description says I can't do this if it requires targeting cards.\n\nI have enough money, and I have a Reroll Surplus voucher. I could reroll the shop, but Pluto is a guaranteed small benefit, so I'll grab it.\n\nI've considered Loyalty Card, but Gros Michel is more consistent for my current playstyle. So, the plan is to buy Pluto. I'm going with `buy_and_use_consumable` at position 2 (Pluto).\n\nThe action will be: `{\"action\": \"buy_and_use_consumable\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
