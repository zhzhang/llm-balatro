{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Reroll Shop**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, the final ante, and I've got a strong Flush build, sitting at around 212k per hand. My current hand level is pretty significant, and the jokers are synergistic. I have $18, and my goal is to defeat the Ante 8 Boss.\n\nI've got a few options: buy a Standard Pack, reroll the shop, or just proceed to the round select. The Standard Pack might offer a useful card, but with my current deck, the impact is likely marginal at this point. I've been aggressive in past turns looking for Jupiter, and rerolling seems to have better odds of finding something game-changing, like Jupiter or a good Tarot card, especially given the low reroll cost ($3).\n\nMy analysis so far indicates the current setup should *easily* clear the boss. Previous hand scoring was 178k, and my calculations put me well over 200k consistently. But it's standard practice to maximize power heading into a final boss battle, which means the most active and \"pro\" move is to reroll for a Planet or Tarot card.\n\nI've checked the Joker setup: it's optimized, with Brainstorm copying The Tribe, the Droll Joker adding to both Multiplier and Polyhrome bonus, and Ramen offering a solid multiplier. No need to rearrange jokers. I've also eliminated the usefulness of the current shop cards, Venus, Mercury, and Pluto. I'm *not* going to sell Judgement for $1, since I can't currently use another joker.\n\nI'm at the end of the game and already double the required score, but a debuff boss may complicate things. In this situation, the best course of action is still to reroll. I have enough money to reroll multiple times. Rerolling the shop is the next logical step.\n\nSo, here's the final call. After reviewing the schema and previous actions, I'm going to **reroll the shop** to find a better card.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
