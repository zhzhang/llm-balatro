{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Pack Selection: Prioritizing Flush Synergy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 3, Round 6, time for the PLANET_PACK step. My inventory's looking pretty good. I've got a Gros Michel for +15 Mult, an Egg for a quick $16, the Droll Joker which boosts Flush Mult and gives it a Polychrome multiplier, and Perkeo, the Legendary that can copy a consumable, and Delayed Gratification for a little bonus if I don't use a discard. The Moon consumable is also in the bag, which helps my Flush strategy by converting cards to Clubs.\n\nMy primary goal right now is to grab the best planet card from this Jumbo Celestial Pack. Considering my hand strategy, which is heavily invested in Flushes (already at Level 3), the choice seems pretty clear.\n\nLooking at the Pack Choices: Jupiter (Flush upgrade), Venus (Three of a Kind), Neptune (Straight Flush), Uranus (Two Pair), and Earth (Full House).\n\nJupiter is the obvious winner. It directly buffs Flushes, which is exactly what I'm aiming for, considering my Droll Joker and the Moon.\n\nNow, a consideration with Perkeo: If I take Jupiter, it will be consumed immediately. Perkeo copies consumables at the shop's end, so, it won't be available to copy. The Moon is the current consumable. This is a simple choice.\n\nTherefore, the command will be `select 1`, since Jupiter is the first card in the pack. It's the `action` is \"select\", with Jupiter at position 1. No card targets are necessary with the PLANET_PACK.\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"select\",\n    \"positions\": [\n        1\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe intended hand type is not relevant here since I'm not playing a hand at this step. Jupiter is the best choice for this Flush build.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
