{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Decision Point**\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. I'm sitting on a meager $3. The inventory is: I have 'Ride the Bus' in the first slot, providing additive mult; 'Acrobat' in the second slot, which is a multiplier on the final hand; and 'Midas Mask' in the third slot. No consumables, unfortunately. The shop is tempting with that Vampire joker, but at $12, it's completely out of reach. The standard pack, clearance sale voucher, and even a reroll are also too rich for my blood.\n\nI've checked the standard actions: there are no consumables to use or sell. The Joker order is already optimized: 'Ride the Bus' first for the additive mult, followed by 'Acrobat' for that juicy multiplier on the final hand. Midas Mask's position isn't a factor here since it doesn't have an edition that would make a difference in its position. Selling a joker is a last resort, and I have enough scoring power, so I don't see the need. I can't afford to buy any cards, booster packs, vouchers, or even reroll the shop.\n\nTherefore, since I'm locked out of any active plays, the only feasible move is to proceed to round selection. There's nothing else I can do right now. Before I move on, I'm just re-checking that the Joker positioning is optimal. 'Ride the Bus' before 'Acrobat' for the additive mult, that's correct.\n\n**Action: Round Selection.**\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
