Ante 1/8, Boss Blind is active, and I need 600 chips to win. Hearts are debuffed, so I'll minimize their impact. I've got two Jokers: Ride the Bus, which I'll build up by avoiding scoring face cards, and Acrobat, which I'll save for a massive multiplier on the final hand. My starting hand is: 8s, 4s, Qh, 5h, Ac, Kc, 9c, 2c. I can see the potential to build a Flush here with more Clubs or Spades. Let's make the best use of the cards I have.\\n\\nHand 1 is all about building Ride the Bus. I need to play a hand without face cards that score so it doesn't reset. I'll discard strategically. \\n\\nLet's discard the Qh, Kc, 5h, 4s, and 2c. I want to draw in some good cards. \\n\\nI'll play [8s, 4s, Ac, 9c, 2c] as a \\\"High Card\\\", with the Ace as my lead. No scoring face cards! The Ace is the highest card.\\n\\nThis means Ride the Bus will go to +5 from +4! Chips will be (5 base + 11 Ace) * (1 base + 4 Ride the Bus) = 80 chips. This is great for the start. 80 is a good base for starting and I can make this play to get ride the bus going. \\n\\nI'll play three more hands to build this joker and save the final hand for Acrobat, for maximum score. I'll save any discards to get a better hand as possible, maybe a Flush.\\n\\nAll right, let's play the Ace of Clubs hand, and see what the next draw gets me.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 1 2 5 7 8 high card 80\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 19]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 3\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

Ante 1/8, Boss Blind, and I need a whopping 600 chips to win.  I've got 96 so far, and only 3 hands left.  I own two Jokers: Ride the Bus and Acrobat. Ride the Bus has this fantastic multiplier that builds up by playing consecutive non-face card hands. Acrobat? That's my big finisher with a 3x multiplier on the last hand.\\n\\nMy current hand is a bit of a mess:  Aces (one debuffed), a Queen (debuffed), some Fives (one debuffed), a King, a 9, a 6, and a Ace. The Heart cards are debuffed. The key is to maximize the \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" bonus. I'm thinking of aiming for a +7 multiplier on Ride the Bus before the final Acrobat hand.\\n\\nMy initial thought was to discard the face cards and the debuffed cards to get better cards.  I have 4 discards available.  But wait, is discarding the best move? It is not ideal to discard and forfeit a play.\\n\\nI need 504 more chips, and with Acrobat on the last hand, I can generate over 3,000 chips.  So getting there is not difficult.  I have to discard any Hearts and face cards to prepare for this plan.  I need to use my discards efficiently.\\n\\nLooking again at the options, I have to play 2 more hands and then the final hand. I can use the first hands to play for points and to build Ride the Bus.  The debuffed cards will make it tricky, however.\\n\\nI have 3 hands to play. The best strategy is to avoid face cards on the first two hands to build Ride the Bus's multiplier. On the final hand, I will use Acrobat.\\n\\nSo, I think I will play the current hand. I want to play a \\\"Pair\\\" hand with Aces. I will select the Aces (7, 2), plus 6, 8, and 1 to be safe: 7 (Ad), 2 (Ah), 6 (6c), 8 (5d), 1 (9s). That generates a solid score with Aces. This keeps the Bus multiplier growing.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 1 2 6 7 8 pair 147\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 20]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 3\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

Ante 1/8, Boss Blind \\u2013 hearts are nerfed, good to know. We need 600 chips, currently at 264, so 336 more. Two hands left, Acrobat on the final hand \\u2013 gotta make it count. Ride the Bus is already at +6, ideally we want to get it to +7 by the time we need it. Current hand has a mix: Queens (scoring face), debuffed Hearts, and a couple of diamonds. Strategy: play one more non-face hand to bump up Ride the Bus, then Acrobat for the final big score.\\n\\nGiven this current hand with the debuffed cards and the need to scale Ride the Bus, the safest play is to avoid any scoring face cards. I need to get as many non-face cards as possible on the board. Need to decide what constitutes a \\\"scoring face card\\\", the description says \\\"without a scoring face card\\\". Debuffed face cards *still* reset Ride the Bus if they are part of the scoring hand? The best approach is to avoid any face cards entirely in the final hand. So, it's safer to avoid *any* face cards in the current play.\\n\\nSo, I have some choices: either play the diamonds and see what comes, or discard and try to fish for something better for the last hand, while at the same time avoiding resetting Ride the Bus. I've got discards to burn, so discarding the Queens, 7h, 6h, and looking for something stronger is the ideal play here. I can get rid of the face cards to keep Ride the Bus. The plan is to get to a stronger hand on the final round. Since I want to scale Ride the Bus to +7, I need to get rid of the face cards to ensure Ride the Bus will scale. I need to discard the Qs, Qh, 7h, 6h, for some non-scoring/non-face cards to clear space.\\n\\nIf I play a High Card now with the 10d, I get (5 + 10) * (1 + 6) = 105 chips. That's a good starting point. That leaves me with 231 to make on the last hand, with Acrobat, which should be easily doable, given I'm at a +6 to Ride the Bus and scaling.\\n\\nLet's look at the \\\"play\\\" vs \\\"discard\\\" strategy again. Discarding feels better for the final, big hand, and I can be more selective. The question is, which is the more *optimal* action right now? The description says \\\"without a scoring face card\\\", so I must be certain.\\n\\nLet's discard the Qs, Qh, 7h, 6h and Kc and keep the 10d, 9d, and 5h. I can try to get something stronger on the final round. And that gets me ready for the final hand where I can play Acrobat to score the max possible chips.\\n\\nGiven that I'm discarding, I am leaving the board, so let's start fresh and look at what will happen with the final hand. The goal is to accumulate enough chips so that I can beat the 600 mark. And the easiest way to do that, is to play the 10d as a high card to clear the board, and get Ride the Bus on the final round. So, let's play the 10d as the highest card to be very safe. I want the final hand to count with Ride the Bus at +7 and Acrobat X3.\\n\\nIf I play a 10 with the Ride the Bus, I get (5 + 10) * (1 + 6) = 105 chips. 105 + 264 = 369. To reach 600 I need 231 chips. On the final hand, if I had a High Card, then I can reach it without risk. High Card = (5 + 10) * (1 + 7) * 3 = 360. 369 + 360 = 729. I am very confident of this.\\n\\nSo, I discard the face cards and the low hearts and play the [10d], and the total would be (10 + 5) * (1+6) = 105. That's a safe play.\\nAnd with the math, I'm easily above 600, so let's play the 10d.\\n\\nSo, let's play [7, 8, 3, 4, 5] (10d, 9d, 7h, 6h, 5\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 3 4 5 7 8 high card 105\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 3\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

  "reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision: The Final Hand**\n\nOkay, here we are. Final hand, Ante 1/8, and the Psychic (aka, The Head) is on the line. I've got a debuffed Queen of Hearts staring me in the face, along with a few other face cards I don't want to play if I can avoid it.  The goal is straightforward: I need 600 chips, and I'm currently sitting on 384. I have two powerful Jokers: \"Ride the Bus\" (+7 Mult, resets on scoring face cards) and \"Acrobat\" (X3 Mult on the final hand).  The strategy is clear, I need to protect \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nI quickly assess my hand:  Qs, Js, Qh (debuffed), Jh (debuffed), Kc, Jc, 7c, and 4c. The Heart cards are debuffed, so I know I want to avoid those (even if they *were* Hearts), and this means keeping Ride the Bus. My focus is on playing a non-face card to keep my mult high. I have 4 discards available; I should utilize them.\n\nI begin by calculating the potential, if I can find a non-face card. If I play a non-face card, I can get a (5 + X) * (1 + 7) * 3 =  X. I need 216 chips.\n\nThe optimal strategy emerges quickly: I need to discard the face cards to maximize my mult and protect \"Ride the Bus\".  The best option is to play the 7c. I run the numbers:  (5 (Base High Card) + 7 (7c)) * (1 (Base Mult) + 7 (Ride the Bus) * 3(Acrobat) = 12 * 8 * 3 = 288 chips. 384 (current) + 288 (potential) = 672, which is well over the 600 target. I double-check to make sure there are no debuffed cards, and the boss is not Psychic. This is a win. I check the metadata to confirm the details.\n\nOne more quick sanity check to be sure: the Last Played Hands section says High Card = 120. I look into this. The math is (5 + 10) * (1 + 7) which validates that the Mult is currently +7 and should remain +7.\n\nWith that, I'm confident. The optimal play is confirmed. I'll play the 7c. \n\n\n"
