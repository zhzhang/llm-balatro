{"reasoning":"**The Strategy is Set: Jumbo Celestial Pack Incoming**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 3, Round 5, $8 in the bank. I've got a strong \"Ride the Bus\" Joker setup, emphasizing non-face card hands for maximum multiplier. The Acrobat is clutch for end-of-round scores. My primary goal is to maximize my scores for this ante, and I've got a few options to get there.\n\nI'm looking at leveling up my hands; right now, High Card is Level 2, as is Flush and Full House. I have a choice: $3 for Earth (Full House) to level it to 3, $3 for Jupiter (Flush) to level it to 3, or a $6 Jumbo Celestial Pack. Considering my \"Ride the Bus\" strategy, focusing on non-face cards for High Card/Pair, Pluto or Mercury are the dream.\n\nI have to think about this carefully. Buying Earth and Jupiter would cost $6 and would guarantee two hand level ups. It could be useful for a big non-face flush or full house. But the $6 Jumbo Celestial Pack is the better option because I have a strong \"Ride the Bus\" build, it gives me a higher chance of landing a high value planet card (Pluto, Mercury).\n\nLet's not forget the shop cards, both Earth and Jupiter are level 2 already. Jumbo Celestial Pack provides the greatest value with its choice of 5 planets.\n\nGiven my \"Ride the Bus\" build, I'm going to opt for a Jumbo Celestial Pack to further hone in on the high value planets.\n\nFinal decision: I'm buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack, with position 1. And the JSON output to reflect that: `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`. Now, let's see what the cosmos has in store.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
