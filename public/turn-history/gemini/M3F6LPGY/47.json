{"reasoning":"**The Optimal Path: A Symphony of Discards and Plays**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan, and it's all about maximizing \"Ride the Bus\" while setting up the \"Acrobat\" play. We're at Round 6, with a small blind, and aiming to hit 2000 chips. We've got 4 hands left, 4 discards, and a meager $2. The key is that \"Ride the Bus\" (+14 Mult, currently) scales with *non-scoring face cards*, \"Acrobat\" triples our final hand's mult, and \"Midas Mask\" throws a confusing wrinkle in the mix with face cards.\n\nMy immediate instinct, which I've now refined through deliberation, is to **discard**. Discarding the Queen of Spades, Jack of Hearts, and King of Clubs is the key to managing my deck and getting those pesky face cards out of the way. It gives me a better chance to find useful numbered cards. I need to focus on building \"Ride the Bus\" and setting up the \"Acrobat\" multiplier, not on the lure of \"Midas Mask\" and potential gold.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1.  **Discard First**: Before I play *anything*, I need to get rid of the face cards to thin the deck. I'm going to discard the Queen of Spades, Jack of Hearts, and King of Clubs.\n2.  **The Ride the Bus Plan**: My core strategy is to get a lot of chips by using the +14 mult and then use the +3 mult from \"Acrobat\".\n3.  **The Hand Strategy**: I need to reach at least 2000 chips. With 4 hands, I need to use all of them. Each \"High Card\" gives me: (25 + Card) \\* (3+14). I can use all the hands by playing one non-face number card each hand to make sure to build the ride, and then use the last hand for Acrobat.\n4.  **Hand-by-Hand Approach**: Play three smaller hands. I'm going to play the 2 of Clubs first. The play looks like this:\n\n    *   **Action**: `play`\n    *   **Positions**: `[5]` (the 2)\n    *   **Hand**: `high card`\n    *   **Estimate**: I need to calculate this. It will be 25 (base) + 2 (from the card) \\* 17 (mult) = 27 \\* 17 = 459 chips.\n5.  **Acrobat is Key**: The key is that Acrobat triggers on the *last* hand. I need to make sure I don't go over 2000 chips on the previous hands.\n6.  **Discarding Strategy**: Now that I understand the game, I need to evaluate if I want to discard or not. The play will be to discard [1, 2, 4].\n\nThe focus is now on making sure that I do everything safely and efficiently by avoiding face cards and maximizing the cards I play.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4]"}
