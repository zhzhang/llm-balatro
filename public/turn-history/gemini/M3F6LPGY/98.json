{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Strategy: Ante 4, Round 11**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm down -$14, facing \"The Arm\" boss blind which reduces hand levels, and I *need* 10,000 chips. I have four hands and zero discards. The hand I've drawn is: Ace of Spades, 10 of Spades, 3 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, King of Clubs, two 10 of Clubs, and a 7 of Diamonds. I've got a few useful Jokers: \"Ride the Bus\" (great for Clubs but I need to avoid face cards), \"Onyx Agate\" (bonus for Clubs), \"Acrobat\" (final hand multiplier), \"Midas Mask\" (negative face card effect, avoid!) \"Credit Card\" (gives me some breathing room on debt), and \"Sixth Sense\". Ugh, I was *really* hoping to get that Sixth Sense bonus but I don't have a 6 *and* I have no discards left. It is impossible to trigger this round.\n\nMy immediate focus is maximizing my chip generation with what I've got. I need to get as many chips as I can, as quickly as possible, to win. I need to keep \"Ride the Bus\" active, so the King of Clubs *cannot* be played, because it resets the multiplier. And I need to preserve my Club cards as much as possible, because \"Onyx Agate\" loves them.\n\nI've calculated the best hand to play: a High Card, using either the Ace or 10 of Clubs. The *ideal* scenario is to trigger the full \"Ride the Bus\" (+32) and \"Onyx Agate\" (+7), and then the level reduction from \"The Arm\". The plan is to play the Ace of Clubs as the first hand, then the 10 of Clubs in the following hands.\n\nI've considered other strategies, like forming a Pair to gain more Multiplier. But right now, the High Card yields more points. I need to cycle cards to find some more clubs and hopefully finish the round by holding the 10 of Clubs (Pos 7) to gain a Planet Card effect.\n\nI'm ready. The first play will be the Ace of Clubs. While I'm at it, I can also cycle the \"junk\" cards, to get another club in hand for a future round. Okay, let's play the Ace of Clubs! Let's get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,3,8]"}
