{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4/8, Round 8. I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` phase, specifically the Mega Celestial Pack. I'm currently $7 in debt, but my credit card limit is $20, so that's fine for now.\n\nLet's review my hand: I've got \"Ride the Bus\" (+24 mult for not playing face cards), \"Acrobat\" (x3 on the final hand), \"Midas Mask\" (face cards become Gold cards), \"Greedy Joker\" (+3 mult on Diamonds), and the \"Credit Card\" (with that -$20 limit).\n\nMy primary strategy is High Card, which is currently at Level 4 and has been played 16 times this run. My hand strategy is to avoid playing face cards, but to utilize whatever resources are available.\n\nNow for the Mega Celestial Pack choices: Mercury (Pair), Uranus (Two Pair), Venus (Three of a Kind), Pluto (High Card), and Mars (Four of a Kind).\n\nConsidering my current setup, Pluto (High Card) is the obvious pick. It directly supports my existing High Card strategy, and is also going to be the most reliable hand that I can play while also avoiding face cards. Mercury (Pair) is the backup, but I don't need it.\n\nTherefore, the action I need to take is to select Pluto from the pack. I'm thinking:\n\n1.  Select Pluto (High Card) from the pack: Continue to level up my High Card strategy, supporting the \"Ride the Bus\" strategy of avoiding face cards.\n2.  Select Mercury (Pair) from the pack: as the backup if high card isn't available.\n\nThe command needs to be `select <pack_card_position>`. Pluto is in position 4.\n\nThe selected action is \"select\", and the selected positions is [4].\n\nI can use the JSON Schema check to ensure that the request is properly formatted: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [4]}`.\n\nI see no reason not to take Pluto. \"Ride the Bus\" will not be at risk. My debt is also not an issue, as I'm already in the pack.\n\nSo, the action that I will take is `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [4]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
