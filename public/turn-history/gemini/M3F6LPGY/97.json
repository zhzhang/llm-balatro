{"reasoning":"**Analysis Paralysis, But With a Goal**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 4, Round 11, and that boss, The Arm, is going to be a pain. I need 10,000 chips, I've got a mountain of debt, and only four hands to do it. The Jokers are intriguing, but I *need* to trigger Sixth Sense this round. It's my primary goal. 3 sixes left in the deck. I've got one discard. Let's see... the probability of hitting a 6 with the discard is about 42%.\n\nThe Arm reduces hand levels, so playing a High Card means it's a level lower. This is important to note for later calculations. But my focus is that spectral 6 for the Sixth Sense. The Club synergy from Ride the Bus and Onyx Agate is amazing, but I *must* get that 6.\n\nI've got a hand of Clubs that's begging to be exploited, but Sixth Sense is the priority. Discarding non-Clubs is obvious, but I have a special 10 of Clubs. This 10 of Clubs is special, because it creates a planet card on the *final* hand. I have to keep this for the final hand. So, discard the 8 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs.\n\nI have to get a 6.\n\nBut wait a minute, to trigger Sixth Sense, the *first* hand of the round must be a single 6. That's the only way to get it, because I haven't played anything yet. Since I'm discarding 5 cards, I have to *maximize* the odds of getting a 6. So let's discard those non-Club cards. If I fail, I'll need to play for chips, but the odds are in my favor. Okay, cards to discard, the 8 of Spades, the 9 of Hearts, the Jack of Clubs, the 5 of Clubs, and the 2 of Clubs.\n\nAha! Hang on... \"Ride the Bus\" hates face cards. The Jack of Clubs is *definitely* going. I cannot accidentally play it in a hand and ruin that bonus. I need to avoid face cards. But is this where I should discard? I have 1 discard left, I want a 6. Let's just discard the 8S, 9H, JC, 5C, and 2C. I'm discarding the correct cards to go for the 6.\n\nOkay, checking for consumables: 0. Enough room for the Sixth Sense card? Yes. Enough room for the Planet card? Yes.\n\nOkay, let's verify. The Sixth Sense needs to be a *single* 6 on the *first* hand. \"Remaining hands\" is 4, so no hands are played yet. Got it. This is a 43% chance, and I need this. The discards are correct: the 8 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs.\n\nBut wait, I need to know: if I don't hit the 6, can I still make it? Let me think, and I need to not accidentally discard the special 10 of Clubs (Planet). If I play a High Card, and use Ride the Bus with the clubs, I can get that bonus. Should I play the hand? No. I need to go for the spectral 6.\n\nThe previous action was a discard. My remaining discard is now my only move, so discard the cards: 8 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs. Time to pull the trigger...\n\nHold on, let me quickly analyze the hand again. Yes, it's correct. I am keeping the Ace, both special 10s. I discard the 8 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs. If this doesn't work, I can get this later.\n\nLet's do this. I've got to find that 6. This is the optimal play.\n\nHmm, wait. If I *don't* get the 6, can I still reach 10,000 with the discards and play? Let me calculate my options. With a High Card and those Joker bonuses (Ride the Bus, Onyx Agate, and Acrobat), I can reach 9,856 by playing High Club cards. So, I will be close, but still short.\n\nIf I draw the 6: Spectral card!\nIf I don't draw the 6\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,7,8]"}
