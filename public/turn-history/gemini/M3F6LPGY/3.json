{"reasoning":"**Round 1 Decision: Buffoon Pack First**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the very beginning of this run – Round 1, just beat the Small Blind. I have $10, no Jokers or anything else in my inventory, and the goal is to build a scoring engine for the Big Blind (450) and Boss (600). The shop has some interesting options: Photograph (X2 Multiplier on first face card), Saturn (Planet for Straights), Buffoon Pack (Jokers), Celestial Pack (Planets), and Director's Cut (a voucher).\n\nMy initial thought is that Photograph looks like a strong early multiplier, especially since I'll likely be playing face cards and high cards. A Buffoon Pack is also high priority since Jokers are the foundation of many builds. Saturn is decent if I go for Straights. Director's Cut is out of the question for now, it's too expensive.\n\nI'm thinking about a few scenarios.\n\n*   **Option A:** Buy the Buffoon Pack ($4), which leaves me with $6.\n*   **Option B:** Buy Photograph ($5), leaving $5.\n*   **Option C:** Buy both Buffoon Pack and Photograph ($9), leaving $1.\n*   **Option D:** Buy Saturn ($3) and use it.\n\nGiven it's early, Jokers are the biggest priority. Buffoon Pack gives me a choice. Photograph is a guaranteed common but solid X2 Multiplier.\n\nThe money situation is $10. Buying Buffoon ($4) will leave me with $6, enough for Photograph ($5). This feels like the best sequence to build a solid foundation early in the game. That's the core of the strategy right now. It is really tempting to skip the Buffoon Pack and just go for the Photograph card!\n\nMy initial action is to `buy_booster` at position `1` (Buffoon Pack).\n\nWait! Let me re-read the Buffoon Pack description. It says \"Choose 1 of *up to* 2 Joker cards\". It's a choice pack. Can I just buy it and *then* decide? That's the command, yeah, `buy_booster`.\n\nSo, the definitive decision is to buy the Buffoon Pack first to see what Jokers are available. That seems like the most impactful way to start. But maybe photograph is best?\n\nI have $10, which is enough for both. It is better to use the Buffoon Pack *first* and then Photograph. Done! I will execute the Buffoon Pack purchase.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
