I've got the `Ride the Bus` Joker in my inventory, which is key. It's at +0 Mult and gains +1 per hand played without a scoring face card. My current hand is 6\\u2660, 9\\u2665, 8\\u2665, 2\\u2665, 8\\u2663, 3\\u2663, A\\u2666, 6\\u2666. I have 4 hands and 4 discards available. The immediate goal is to win the round while getting `Ride the Bus` up to a decent Mult.\\n\\nThe `Ride the Bus` Joker is the focus here. It *requires* non-scoring face cards to level up, and Aces don't count as face cards. Since I want to scale this as quickly as possible, I want to play as many hands as possible. The primary decision is: should I discard to chase a strong hand or play small hands to scale the joker?\\n\\nRight now, I'm leaning toward getting this Joker going. My hand is: 6S, 9H, 8H, 2H, 8C, 3C, AD, 6D. I can see a couple of easy paths:\\n*   **Two Pair** (Level 1: 20 chips, 2 mult): Play 8s and 6s, for 96 chips and +1 to Ride the Bus.\\n*   **Pair** (Level 1: 10 chips, 2 mult): Play the 8s, for 52 chips and +1 to Ride the Bus.\\n\\nI want to cycle the deck fast.\\n\\nGiven the goal to build the Joker, I'm going to play small hands first. The *best* play for the first hand is to simply play the pair of 8s (8\\u2665, 8\\u2663) for +1 on `Ride the Bus`, keeping the 6s and Ace. I'll include three other non-scoring cards (9H, 2H, 3C) to discard and redraw. This will set me up to maximize the mult.\\n\\n**Action: play**\\n**Positions: \\\\[3, 5, 2, 4, 6]**\\n**Hand: pair**\\n**Chips: 52**\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 3 5 2 4 6 pair 52\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 11]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

I'm currently facing the Big Blind, needing 450 chips, but I only have 78. That leaves me with a deficit of 372 chips to gain, and I have just three hands remaining. The \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" joker is my key to scaling, currently at +1 mult. I have four discards and $2 to spend. The goal here is to carefully optimize each hand to maximize chip gain and scale \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" as much as possible.\\n\\nLooking at my hand: I've got a decent spread: 6 of Spades, 5 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds (high!), Queen of Diamonds (a face card \\u2013 to be avoided), 6 of Diamonds, 4 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds.\\n\\nThe immediate observation is a pair of 6s (6S, 6D), which is a level 1 hand. Playing these alone wouldn't do much. Playing this pair with the other non-face cards (Ace, 5, 4) in the cycle would simply advance the Joker. Playing the Flush (Ace, Queen, 6, 4, 3) in diamonds might seem attractive for higher base chips and mult, but the Queen is a face card.\\n\\nSince I am focused on scaling \\\"Ride the Bus\\\", I want to avoid scoring face cards. I need to get the Joker up to at least +2 mult. That means I have to play the 6s as a pair and the other cards as \\\"garbage\\\".\\n\\nMy previous hand, it looks like, was a Pair, and it seems like the \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" joker has already been calculated. It looks like the Joker scales *before* the mult is applied for the current hand: the previous score was (10 + 8 + 8) * (2 + 1) = 26 * 3 = 78.\\n\\nIf I play the Pair of 6s, the \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" joker goes from +1 to +2 mult. Here is the breakdown: 10 base chips, + 6 + 6 from the cards, for a total of 22 chips. The base mult is 2, and the Joker mult is +2, giving a total mult of 4. So, 22 * 4 = 88 chips. But there is a better play.\\n\\nI see a Straight: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, all non-face cards!\\n\\nThis is where things get interesting. A straight is worth 30 base chips and 4 mult. The sum of the cards is 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 20. So, total chips become 50. The Joker will increase to +2. This makes a total multiplier of 6, for a total score of 300.\\n\\nThat's 300 chips plus the 78 I currently have would give me 378 total chips. This still leaves a deficit of 72. Two more rounds should do it. After this hand, the Joker will be at +2. I see the path forward: Play the Straight.\\n\\nAction: `play`. Positions: `[1, 2, 7, 8, 3]`. Hand: `straight`. Chips: `300`.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 1 2 7 8 3 straight 300\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 12]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

Ante is 1/8, we're in Round 2, Big Blind, and I'm currently at 378 chips. The target is 450, so I need 72 more chips to win this round. With only two hands left, and four possible discards, the pressure is on. I have $2. The \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" Joker is currently at +2 Multiplier, and the goal is to scale it up. It gains +1 Multiplier per hand played *without* a scoring face card (Jack, Queen, or King).\\n\\nMy hand: 8 of Spades (+8), 4 of Spades (+4), Queen of Clubs (+10 - Face Card - avoid), 9 of Clubs (+9), 7 of Clubs (+7), Ace of Diamonds (+11), Queen of Diamonds (+10 - Face Card - avoid), and 6 of Diamonds (+6). I need to avoid playing the Queens to keep \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" scaling.\\n\\n*   **Option 1: Play High Card (Ace of Diamonds)**: This would give me 5 (base) + 11 = 16 chips. Multiplier would be 1 (base) + 3 (Ride the Bus, since there are no face cards) = 4, for a total of 16 * 4 = 64 chips. That falls short.\\n*   **Option 2: Play Pair**: No pairs here.\\n*   **Option 3: Play High Card (9 of Clubs)**: This would yield (5+9) * (1+3) = 14 \\\\* 4 = 56 chips, which is also insufficient.\\n*   **Option 4: Play two non-face cards as junk**: This will achieve the same results as option 1.\\n\\nBut, wait...I have *two* hands. I can play a scaling hand, and then a hand that wins. Let's see if there's a better hand available. 8, 4, 9, 7, 6 -- no pairs. Straights! I need to double-check my straight calculation.\\n\\nLet's check for a straight: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. Looks good!\\n\\n*   Base Straight (Level 1): 30 chips, 4 multiplier\\n*   Card Chips: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 34\\n*   Total Chips: 30 + 34 = 64\\n*   Ride the Bus Multiplier: +3 (if the Joker increments *before* scoring)\\n*   Total Multiplier: 4 + 3 = 7\\n*   Total Score: 64 * 7 = 448\\n\\n*Hold on a minute, did I get my joker scaling logic correct?* Let's quickly re-verify that the Joker increases its multiplier before that hand is scored, using the history:\\n\\n*   Turn 10: Pair of 8s played. Chips: 52. Resulting Joker state: +1.\\n*   Turn 11: Straight played. Chips: 300.\\n\\n    This tells us that in the Straight turn:\\n    *   Base Chips: 30\\n    *   Chips (2,3,4,5,6) = 2+3+4+5+6 = 20\\n    *   Total Chips: 50\\n    *   Total Mult: 4 + 1 = 5\\n    *   Result: 50 * 6 = 300 chips.\\n    *   The history indicates the Joker increased *before* the hand was scored.\\n\\nBack to our calculations:\\n\\n*   Current Joker: +2\\n*   Playing a hand without a face card: Joker should become +3.\\n*   Straight (4, 6, 7, 8, 9): 64 chips, 7 multiplier -> 448 chips total.\\n*   Total: 378 + 448 = 826. (Way over 450).\\n\\nThere are *no* face cards in the [2, 8, 5, 1, 4] positions. The target is 450, and 448 is well over that. Bingo.\\n\\n*   **Action**: Play positions [2, 8, 5, 1, 4] (4, 6, 7, 8, 9) for a straight.\\n\\nLet me double-check:\\n1: 8 of Spades\\n2: 4\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 2 8 5 1 4 straight 448\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

  "reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision: The Final Play**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Big Blind, round 2. I'm sitting at 434 chips and need 16 more to hit the target of 450. I've got one hand left and the \"Ride the Bus\" Joker is currently at +3 multiplier. This Joker is key here – it gains +1 Multiplier per consecutive hand played without a scoring face card. Now, if I play a face card that *scores*, the Joker resets to 0, so that's a no-go.\n\nLooking at my cards: I'm holding a 3 of Hearts, a Queen of Clubs, an Ace of Diamonds, a King of Diamonds, another Queen of Diamonds, a 10 of Diamonds, a 9 of Diamonds, and an 8 of Diamonds. Cards two, four, and five are face cards, but remember, the joker bonus is based on if those cards *score*.\n\nThe plan? Maximize this \"Ride the Bus\" bonus and get those 16 chips. If I can play a high card without a scoring face card, it will become +4 Mult.\n\nI've checked the \"Ride the Bus\" history and confirmed the multiplier increments before the hand's value is calculated. The previous turn's scores confirm it.\n\nSo, here's the play: I'm going to play the Ace of Diamonds (position 3) as a high card. It's an 11-chip card, which will give me a base value of (5 + 11) times the (1 + 4) multiplier, and that's equal to 80 chips! Way more than the 16 I need. Since the Ace is not a face card, I will keep scaling the Mult.\n\nI need to confirm the play. So, I will do a final check.\n\nI am holding the following cards:\n1: 3 of Hearts\n2: Queen of Clubs\n3: Ace of Diamonds\n4: King of Diamonds\n5: Queen of Diamonds\n6: 10 of Diamonds\n7: 9 of Diamonds\n8: 8 of Diamonds\n\nI should avoid a Flush because face cards may score.\n\nTherefore:\n*   Action: Play.\n*   Positions: 3 (Ace of Diamonds).\n*   Intended Hand Type: High Card.\n*   Estimated Chips: 80.\n\n*Let's proceed.*\n\n\n"
