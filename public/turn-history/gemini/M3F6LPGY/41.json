{"reasoning":"**Alright, let's break this down meticulously. We're in Ante 2, Round 5, staring down \"The Pillar\" boss blind. My goal is 1600 chips, and I'm currently at 473. With only two hands left and four discards, this is where we're going to have to maximize our strategy.**\n\nFirst, I need to take a quick look at the board and remember what I have to work with. I have \"Ride the Bus\" adding 12 mult, for each hand without a face card. Then I have \"Acrobat\" which will multiply the final hand by 3. Also, I have \"Midas Mask\" which turns face cards into gold - not super helpful in this situation, so I have no need to consider this. Now my biggest concern is this debuff from \"The Pillar,\" so I have to remember that 8s, Aces, 2s and 3s are out.\n\nI need 1127 more chips. I need to use this information to create a viable strategy. Given that I have \"Acrobat\" I need to save the big play for the last hand to be able to get the most.\n\nLet's look at the hand: Queen of Spades, 8 of Spades, 7 of Spades, Jack of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, 10 of Diamonds, and 9 of Diamonds. The 8 and Ace are debuffed, so, they are no good. The 7s are not debuffed, so they are looking like a good option to use. \n\nMy immediate instinct is to maximize the \"Ride the Bus\" multiplier, playing non-face cards in consecutive hands. I have two viable strategies in mind. The first is to go for a non-face card hand this round and a big hand on the last round and second is to play the 7s now.\n\nLet's do the math on the first option - let's say I play a high card 7 now, which would net me 308 chips. That would leave me with 819 chips to be made on the final round. If I went with a High Card 10 for the final hand, with \"Acrobat\" the mult would be 45 and net me 1125 chips, which would put me above the goal.\n\nNow, let's calculate the second option: Play a pair of 7s on the first hand. The chips would be 336. That would mean my total is at 809, and the remaining would be 791 chips. I can do the same final calculation and get 1125, which gives me a total of 1934 which goes past the goal.\n\nWith those things considered I'm going to commit to using the 7s now and then discard the faces on the final hand to maximize the chances of a big hand. I'm going to select 7 of Spades and 7 of Clubs and play a pair. I'm going to have to remember that I want to increment Ride the Bus before this final hand is scored.\n\nSo now, let's be sure about the play, 7s will work. I'm going to play that pair, and draw 2 new cards.\n\nI have it! Play the pair of 7s (indices 3 and 5). It's a calculated move. It maximizes both scoring chips now and sets up a high-powered final hand.\n\nNow, to solidify the decision: I'm going to play the 7s!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,5]"}
