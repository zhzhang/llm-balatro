{"reasoning":"**The Pillar: A Strategic Assessment**\n\nOkay, so here we are, Ante 2, Round 4. The Boss Blind, \"The Pillar,\" is staring me down. My goal? 1600 chips to move on. This \"Pillar\" is a pain – debuffing cards used previously this ante. Gotta remember that. Let's see, what have I got to work with?\n\nI've got a killer hand with: Ride the Bus (+10 Mult, and it grows with non-face cards – sweet!), Acrobat (x3 Multiplier on the last hand – that's crucial), and Midas Mask (turns face cards Gold and gives me money at the end, although I want to avoid the face cards for Ride the Bus). I have $3, no consumables.\n\nLooking back, the Big Blind used a Four of a Kind (3,848 chips) and Two Pair (484 chips). Since The Pillar debuffs previously used cards, I need to stay away from the cards used in those hands. That's fine.\n\nThe strategy is clear: focus on building Ride the Bus. Avoid those face cards unless absolutely necessary. Since the Midas Mask turns face cards gold, I might use gold cards to earn money. Since I need to hit 1600 chips, the high card is the best play with the Ride the Bus to get the base of 12 mult. That should easily get me there. If I hit a 10, the hand scores (15 + 10) * 12 = 300, and with Acrobat (300 * 3) = 900. I think it is achievable with a few hands.\n\nSo, the next step is straightforward: `play_round`. My Joker order is already optimized (Additive then Multiplicative, that's what I want). No consumables, no need to sell anything. Money is useless right now. I just need to get those cards onto the table. Let's get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
