{"reasoning":"**Strategic Card Selection: Pluto, the Path of Consistency**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in the PLANET_PACK phase after wisely investing in the Jumbo Celestial Pack, but currently, the coffers are a bit thin at $2. We've got a solid Joker core: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, and that pesky Midas Mask. The strategy is clear: Ride the Bus is our engine, scaling on consecutive non-face card hands. Acrobat will be our grand finale X3 Multiplier. Midas Mask is a slight negative here, but we can manage.\n\nThe core play has been High Card at Level 2, as it's the most reliable way to avoid those face cards and feed Ride the Bus. Now, we have a decision to make from the available Planet Packs.\n\nWe have a few choices, and I need to assess these choices with the current situation in mind.\n\n*   **Uranus:** Two Pair, not core to the strategy.\n*   **Neptune:** Straight Flush, too risky for Ride the Bus.\n*   **Venus:** Three of a Kind, a decent hand but tricky to play without face cards.\n*   **Pluto:** High Card +1 Mult/+10 Chips. This is a direct upgrade to our current bread-and-butter High Card.\n*   **Mars:** Four of a Kind, great potential, but too reliant on chance.\n\nGiven the Ride the Bus + Acrobat game plan, consistency is king. High Card is the most consistent and easily played hand. Pluto directly levels it up and the added bonus of chips is helpful. It's a no-brainer.\n\nChoosing Pluto also aligns with the rationale from the previous turn. It's the most appropriate option based on the situation.\n\nSo, the action is `select`, and the position is `[4]`. There is no intention of playing a hand, nor are the chips a concern for the current turn.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
