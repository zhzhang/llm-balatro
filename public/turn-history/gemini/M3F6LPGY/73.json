{"reasoning":"**Analysis of a High Card Hand**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 8 with a Jumbo Standard Pack. My credit card is about to hit its limit, with only $7 of \"budget\" remaining. Let's see what we've got. I have a good Joker setup: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask (which, according to the text, gives $3 at the end of the round if held and +1 Joker slot, despite the usual effect, which is interesting), Greedy Joker, and Credit Card.\n\nMy strategy is High Card, level 5, and I'm using \"Ride the Bus\". Given that \"Ride the Bus\" gains mult per hand played without a scoring face card, I want to avoid those at all costs. I have a consumable, \"The Star,\" to convert cards to Diamonds if needed.\n\nNow, let's look at the hand. I'm given five choices:\n\n1.  A 3 of Hearts. This has a secondary effect: Creates a Planet card for the final hand if held in hand.\n2.  A 10 of Clubs. This has the same Planet secondary effect.\n3.  A 3 of Spades. Again, the Planet effect.\n4.  A 2 of Hearts. Plain.\n5.  A Jack of Clubs. This has a bonus of +30 chips *and* the Planet effect, but it's a face card, so I avoid it to keep \"Ride the Bus\" going.\n\nChoices 1, 2, and 3 are really interesting. It appears I have a *Blue Seal*-like effect attached to the cards themselves, meaning that if I hold one of these in my hand, I get a Planet card at the end of the round. Given my High Card strategy, this is incredibly powerful for scaling. So I have to decide which one of these three cards (1, 2, or 3) is best. I see no advantage selecting between them, unless I have a suit preference (I don't). The 10 of Clubs (Choice 2) gives more chips than 3's if I play it, but the planet effect requires me to *hold* the card and not play it.\n\nSo, for these cards, it's not about the chip value *unless* I am forced to score it for some reason (which I'm trying to avoid). I can hold any of these for the final hand.\n\nI'll take the 10 of Clubs (Choice 2). The \"Planet\" effect is the main draw here. So, final thought - Choice 2.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
