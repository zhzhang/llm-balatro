{"reasoning":"**Expert Analysis: Shop Phase - Zero Dollars, Optimal Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop, Round 7, Boss Blind incoming, and I'm flat broke with zero dollars.  No consumables to use or sell, and no money to buy anything.  The immediate goal is to survive this round since I can't buy anything.\n\nMy Joker setup is: Ride the Bus (+20 Mult), Acrobat (X3 on final hand), Midas Mask (face cards become Gold), and Greedy Joker (+3 Mult for Diamonds).  I've got a full house of Jokers, but I need to make sure they're in the right order for maximum point gain when the round is about to end.\n\nFirst, I need to check the Joker order. Acrobat, the X3 multiplier, needs to be after any additive multipliers like Ride the Bus and Greedy Joker. I need to make sure it's at the end. I need to trigger the additive mult before the final hand triggers Acrobat, to maximize the effect.\n\nBut, before I spend time on that, since I have zero dollars, it seems like the most prudent action is to proceed to the next phase, `round_select`.\n\n*   `round_select` it is. No other actions are possible here, anyway.\n*   Let's check the schema to verify. Okay, nothing to rearrange. It's just a simple move.\n*   However, before I leave, is there any final Joker arrangement to maximize?\n\nOkay, let's look at the Joker trigger order more closely.\nRule 3: \"Played cards score left-to-right, each card triggering: ... 'On scored' Jokers (left-to-right for multiple Jokers)\".\nRule 5: \"'Independent' Jokers activate left-to-right (basic Joker, editions on Jokers)\".\n\nSo, the Greedy Joker (+3 on Diamonds) is an \"On Scored\" Joker (Step 3). Ride the Bus (+20) and Acrobat (X3) are \"Independent\" Jokers (Step 5). The order of Greedy Joker relative to the Independent Jokers is irrelevant.\n*   The ideal trigger order for maximum mult is additive before multiplicative. Currently, my setup is: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask, Greedy Joker.\n*   I think the initial order: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask, Greedy Joker is best because Acrobat comes at the end, and the others aren't multiplicative (other than Acrobat).\n\nSince I'm out of money, proceeding to the next round is the correct choice.\n\n*   Final action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
