{"reasoning":"**The Plan Takes Shape**\n\nOkay, here's the current situation. I'm in the Big Blind, with $1, and aiming for 1200 chips. \"Ride the Bus\" is my primary scaling tool (+8 mult, scaling up if no face cards score), and \"Acrobat\" provides a juicy x3 mult on the final hand. I've got a Strength consumable to play with, which is key. The boss \"The Pillar\" is looming, debuffing cards I've previously played.  The initial hand is J♠, 8♠, 6♠, 5♠, A♥, 8♣, K♦, J♦.\n\nMy initial strategy revolves around the \"Ride the Bus\" mechanic. I need to avoid playing face cards (Jacks, Kings) to keep that multiplier climbing.  The King can be turned into an Ace, which is NOT a face card.\n\nSo, here's my first move. I've got two face cards, a King of Diamonds, a Jack of Spades, and a Jack of Diamonds. I could discard the face cards and fish for better cards. But, I've got Strength. The best play is to use Strength on the King of Diamonds (pos 7) to turn it into an Ace. This immediately gives me a non-face card to play. It also sets me up for a potential Two Pair with my existing 8s. Strength and Ride the Bus are the keys here.\n\nI'll then evaluate my next steps: discarding cards, and hopefully play some good non-face card hands to scale \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nI'm ready to execute the use of Strength.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2, 7]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,7]"}
