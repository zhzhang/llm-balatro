{"reasoning":"**Balatro: The Final Push**\n\nOkay, here we go. Round 11, the dreaded \"The Arm\" boss blind is upon us, and I'm down to the wire. My goal is a cool 10,000 chips, and I'm currently sitting at 3,564, with a measly two hands left. The pressure is on! And I'm in the hole with -$14.\n\nFirst, I need to take stock. I've got my Ride the Bus joker at a solid +34 mult, Onyx Agate is giving me +7 for Clubs, and Acrobat is lurking, ready to triple my mult on the final hand. Oh, and of course, Midas Mask, making face cards Gold, but I'm trying to avoid them.  I am hoping to use Sixth Sense and the Credit Card if needed.\n\nThe key is this hand: Ace of Spades, 10 of Spades, 3 of Spades, King of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, and 6 of Diamonds. The Arm is going to drop my hand level. This is key to my strategy.\n\nI have two hands to make this happen, meaning my goal is to get as high a chip score as possible without losing the advantage.\n\nMy initial thought was to play the 7 of Clubs in the next hand, to get the most chips, keeping my 10 of Clubs for the final hand to trigger the planet. But wait, I've got to play the numbers. What if the calculations are all wrong? I need to get as many chips as possible from the penultimate hand.\n\nI need 6,436 chips. If I can play the 7 of Clubs next, I can get 1,408. But, I am still 5,028 chips short! \n\nI need to maximize this first hand. Then the final.\n\nI need to evaluate all the hands... High Card, Flush, Pair, etc. And, oh, the cards left in the deck! What do I need to pull? I've got a lot of calculations to make, a lot of what-ifs to analyze.\n\nAh-ha! A Pair of 10s... If I play the 10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs, I score 1,980. That's better! If I score 1,980 on the penultimate hand, plus the total for the current 3,564, I need at least 4,456 more for the win.  I need to score high in the final hand.\n\nAlso, Ride the Bus will give me another +1 mult. So the final hand will be higher.\n\nThen, there's the Acrobat multiplier. That adds even more to the final score.\n\nAnd finally, to keep Onyx Agate activated, I need to make sure I score the Club card. So, if I play a Pair, and score a Club card, then the Onyx Agate is activated. I can't let it pass. I have to count it in.\n\nI have to carefully evaluate the final hand. I need to make sure I score a Club.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I will play the 10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs for a Pair of 10s in the penultimate hand (1,980 chips). I must play a Club card (10 of Clubs), in that hand to get the Onyx Agate. Then, I need to draw some good cards to get the highest score possible in the final hand.\n\nIn the penultimate hand, I must not use the Queen or King. Those ruin my strategy. I will play the two 10s, with the other cards, and pray for high cards!\n\nI've got this. I think. Okay, let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,5,1,3,8]"}
