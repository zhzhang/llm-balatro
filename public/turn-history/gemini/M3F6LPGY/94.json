{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 11, and I'm down -$14, needing 10,000 chips to advance. \"The Arm\" is going to mess with my hand levels, so I need to be efficient. I have some powerful modifiers: \"Ride the Bus\" (massive mult for no face cards), \"Onyx Agate\" (Clubs mult), \"Acrobat\" (x3 final hand mult), and \"Sixth Sense\" (guaranteed Spectral on a 6). The credit card is a safety net, but I want to avoid using it.\n\nMy hand cards are: 5 of Spades, Queen of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds, and 8 of Diamonds. Right now, my best engine is \"High Card.\"\n\nMy primary concern right now is the \"The Arm\" ability. I have to think through whether to roll for a Spectral card. I have to keep this in mind.\n\nI have two potential strategies:\n\n*   **Strategy A (Sixth Sense):** Focus on discards to get a 6 and activate \"Sixth Sense.\" It guarantees a Spectral card.\n*   **Strategy B (Scoring):** Go for maximum High Card points, using the Clubs for \"Onyx Agate.\"\n\nI did some calculations: a pure \"High Card\" run, utilizing Clubs in every hand, could get me to around 10,200 chips at the end of the round. My biggest calculation is to get the Spectral card for the \"Sixth Sense\" ability. I think I have about a 30% chance of finding one (6) with 4 discards. And because of \"The Arm,\" I need to make the first hand worth it.\n\nSo, I think the Sixth Sense is the best thing to do. The ability to guarantee a Spectral card, such as Immolate, could be a game changer. I'll discard non-essentials to find that elusive 6: Queen of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds, and 8 of Diamonds. Let's do it!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,7,8]"}
