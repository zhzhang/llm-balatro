{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Making the Best Play**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 2, Round 4. Got $7 in the bank. Currently running \"Ride the Bus\" for a nice +10 Mult, and Acrobat for that x3 Mult on the final hand. My immediate thought is, let's look at this shop. Five Joker slots max, two currently filled. No consumables. Let's see what's on offer.\n\nThe first thing that grabs my eye is the Midas Mask. It's a *Negative* edition, and it costs *zero* dollars. It doesn't take up a Joker slot, making it a must-buy. The description says face cards become gold cards which gives synergy with the vampire joker. Hold on a second, though... the description is a little weird; there is no secondary description for Midas mask in the normal game, only \"All played face cards become Gold cards when scored.\" Okay, the \"Secondary Description: $3 if this card is held in hand at end of round +1 Joker slot\" suggests the presence of a mod. Either way, it's free. This is a no-brainer.\n\nThe second shop item is Vampire, a Polychrome edition for $12. Since I only have $7, that's a no-go for now. Vampire gains Mult for Enhanced cards.\n\nThe snag is that Ride the Bus is going to reset if a face card scores. This is a bit of a dilemma, but since I have no other choice, for now I'm getting the Midas Mask. Once I have the Midas Mask, I will have $7 left, so I can buy a booster pack (Arcana or Standard).\n\nMy action plan is straightforward: I'm going to immediately buy the Negative Midas Mask. This is an easy choice. Then I'll have $7, which I can use for a booster. Therefore, the command will be \"buy\\_card 1\".\n\nNo reason to hesitate. Let's execute and see what we get!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
