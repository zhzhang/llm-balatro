{"reasoning":"**Choosing the Best Joker: Round 2 Decision**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Round 2, Ante 1/8, and I'm staring at a crucial Joker selection. I've got a \"Ride the Bus\" Joker already, which is building its Multiplier with non-face card hands. My bank is empty, which isn't ideal, but it focuses my decision. The choices are: \"Mad Joker,\" \"Acrobat,\" \"Jolly Joker,\" and \"Astronomer.\"\n\n\"Mad Joker\" and \"Jolly Joker\" offer more additive Multiplier, which is okay, but not what I'm really looking for. I need something that will help me scale and score. \"Astronomer\" looks tempting with its potential for free Planets and Celestials in the long run, setting up massive scaling later. But right now, with no money, that's not helping me *now*. What I need is more immediate scoring power.\n\n\"Acrobat\" is where it's at. That X3 Multiplier on the final hand of the round is a game-changer. Since I already have \"Ride the Bus,\" I can build that up with a few non-face card hands and then unleash \"Acrobat\" for a massive score boost on the final hand. This also plays into an existing strategy, so it's a great choice. \"Acrobat\" provides the highest scoring potential, especially as the game progresses and my base Multiplier increases. Given this situation, the best course of action is to select the \"Acrobat\" joker.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
