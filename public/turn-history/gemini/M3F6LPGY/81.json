{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: The Sixth Sense Gamble**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 9, SHOP phase. I'm deep in the red with -$17 and a debt limit of -$20 thanks to the Credit Card. I've got a solid Joker setup: Ride the Bus (essential scaling), Acrobat (crucial for big scores), Midas Mask (negative, good for the slot, though the money generation is irrelevant with my current strategy), Greedy Joker (+3 mult for diamonds, weak link), Credit Card (keeping me alive, but I *must* avoid a default), and Onyx Agate (bought last round, +7 mult for clubs - excellent!).\n\nMy gut says to sell Greedy Joker – it's the weakest link in my Joker lineup, but a +3 mult is still a +3 mult, but now I have an amazing option. I just got a spectral joker: Wraith. That joker is run-winning.\n\nThe real problem is that I only have a spending budget of $3 before I hit the debt limit. I need a way to create money. The shop options are the Sixth Sense ($6), Standard Pack ($4), and Seed Money ($10). Clearly, Seed Money is out of the question.\n\nI can make just enough for Sixth Sense if I make the right sales. I'll need $6.\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\n1.  Sell Greedy Joker ($2): -$17 + $2 = -$15\n2.  Sell The Star ($1): -$15 + $1 = -$14\n3.  Buy Sixth Sense ($6): -$14 - $6 = -$20.\n\nSixth Sense lets me get spectral cards. A Wraith will set me to 0 money, but will be worth it.\n\nSixth Sense provides powerful Spectral cards. The synergy with Ride the Bus is obvious. I need to make the Sixth Sense play.\n\nTherefore, the only play is to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"sell_joker\",\n  \"positions\": [4]\n}\n```\n\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
