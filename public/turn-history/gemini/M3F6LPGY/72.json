{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4, Round 8. I'm in the SHOP phase. I'm down -$7, but my credit card limit is -$20, so I have some wiggle room. My primary goal is to win this Ante. I'm running a High Card strategy, with Ride the Bus being my main multiplier (currently at +24). I want to continue this playstyle!\n\nMy Jokers are: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask, Greedy Joker, and Credit Card.\n\nInitially, I had a strategic conflict in mind with Midas Mask and Ride the Bus. Ride the Bus doesn't want face cards, but Midas Mask wants to score face cards. But, I remember that the secondary description of Midas Mask is a typo or some variant, which isn't the standard effect of turning face cards to gold when scored. The true function is to make face cards Gold *when scored*. But I don't want to break my Ride the Bus streak, so I won't play face cards and will avoid triggering Midas Mask.\n\nI have a Jumbo Standard Pack available for $6, and Seed Money for $10. I'm currently leaning towards the pack. Since I'm running High Card (non-face cards), adding to the deck with low-rank cards or Diamonds is ideal. The pack could contain a card with an enhancement or just a useful rank/suit. I've got $13 of credit left, so this is within my limit.\n\nHowever, I'm thinking about the order of Jokers. Greedy Joker should be to the left of Acrobat for the multiplier bonuses. But, re-reading the rules, Greedy Joker (On Scored) happens *before* Acrobat (Independent). So the order doesn't matter, and the current joker order is good.\n\nI have -$7, but I can go -$13.\n\nMy action will be to `buy_booster 1`, I'm going to add a card to my deck and hope it helps! I've confirmed that this is my most effective action. I want to keep moving.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
