{"reasoning":"**My Decision: Play the Round**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 3/8, Round 5, I'm facing the Small Blind, and I have just $2. My immediate goal is to get to the 2000 chips needed to clear the blind. I have three Jokers in play: \"Ride the Bus\" is my main engine, scaling up my multiplier (+14 per non-face hand), and I need to prioritize playing non-face hands. \"Acrobat\" provides a x3 multiplier on the final hand, and \"Midas Mask\" turns played face cards Gold, which award money at round end ($3 per gold card in hand).\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n*   I **need** money. $2 is not going to cut it in the shop.\n*   I can't afford to skip this round and depend on the D6 tag for rerolls as I have no money to spend on shop items.\n*   Playing the Small Blind pays $3 and gets me closer to 8 hands played, which will boost \"Ride the Bus\" significantly.\n*   My base High Card (Level 3) gives me 25 chips and 3 mult. \"Ride the Bus\" currently scales my multiplier to 17. If I play 3 high cards without face cards, then play a final scoring hand, then \"Ride the Bus\" will go up to 18.\n*   A rough calculation shows that I can easily clear 2000 chips in a few hands: (25 chips + average card) \\* 17 (mult) \\* 3 (Acrobat) = a good score.\n*   Therefore, the best option is to play the round.\n*   I can also use \"Midas Mask\" to turn face cards gold if I want, but I need to play them in order to do so, which would reset \"Ride the Bus.\" \"Midas Mask\" says that it doesn't take up a joker slot, meaning that I can still have 4 jokers total.\n\nSo, the action is definitely `play_round`. I need to generate money, I need to scale my multiplier, and I can't afford to skip this.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
