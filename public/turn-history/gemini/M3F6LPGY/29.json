{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Blind and the Boss**\n\nOkay, here we go. Big Blind, 1200 chips needed, four hands left. I'm sitting on zero chips and have three discards. I have to manage \"Ride the Bus\" (scaling multiplier) and avoid using my Aces and 8s because I want to keep them fresh for the boss. My current hand has a decent starting point with three Aces and two 8s, but playing them now means they get debuffed by the boss, which I want to avoid. Plus, playing face cards resets \"Ride the Bus\", so that's a no-go.\n\nThe goal is to scale up \"Ride the Bus\" using small hands, and then land a big Acrobat-boosted hand at the end. I'm going to discard the King, Queen, and 6 of Diamonds right away to see what I can draw. I'll need to find some non-face, non-Aces, and non-8s to make trash hands to scale the Joker. It looks like I have three discard actions left.\n\nThe current strategy is to discard the trash and see what I can draw. Then I'll play small hands to scale \"Ride the Bus\" and save the Aces and 8s for the boss fight later.\n\nI need to scale Ride the Bus.\nI need to win the round.\nI need to not debuff my best cards (Lucky Aces).\nI need to not score face cards.\n\nAlright, discard the trash cards (3, 5, 8). \n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,5,8]"}
