{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4, Round 8. The Shop phase. Money is at $-13, and the Credit Card limit is $-20. I've got a decent Joker setup: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask (a slight negative, but it gives me a Joker slot), Greedy Joker, and the Credit Card. I also have The Star consumable, but I can't use it in the shop.\n\nFirst, I consider my options. I can't afford the Seed Money voucher, which is a shame, or buy any cards or boosters. Selling the Star is the only option and will leave me at $-12. Rerolling the shop costs $5, leaving me at $-18. The shop is empty right now, with no cards, boosters, or useful vouchers, so rerolling feels risky given my tight budget. I only have $2 from the credit limit left and anything I find could be unaffordable. Better to save my remaining credit for the next shop or emergency discards.\n\nGiven the goal of reaching 8 Boss Blinds, and the current state of my inventory and money, I decide to proceed to the next round. I'm focusing on High Card/Ride the Bus. My Jokers are stable, with Ride the Bus, Acrobat, and Greedy Joker. I double-check the order of my Jokers and their interactions. Acrobat multiplies the final hand, while Greedy Joker adds to the Diamonds. The order I have is generally fine, and the math checks out. The priority is to maximize my multipliers.\n\nSo, the optimal order is already in place. My final decision is to proceed to the round select, and start the next round with my current inventory.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
