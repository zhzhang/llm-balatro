{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shopping: Ante 4, Round 8**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4, Round 8, and the game step is SHOP. I've got a single dollar, but the credit card extends my effective funds to $21, up to a $20 debt. My Joker setup is pretty decent: \"Ride the Bus\" is going to be helpful for the high card strategy. I have the \"Acrobat\", \"Midas Mask\", and \"Greedy Joker\" to boost the hand. I have a consumable \"The Star\", which has potential later, but can't do anything for me right now.\n\nMy immediate goal is to improve the deck for Ante 4. My current focus is scaling the High Card. I need to spend the money and improve my scoring potential.\n\nLooking at the shop, the \"Mega Celestial Pack\" is the top choice at $8. It offers two Planet cards and is the best way to directly scale High Card (Pluto), or maybe even other hands like Flush (Jupiter). The \"Jumbo Standard Pack\" at $6 is okay, potentially helping with Diamonds or useful enhancements, but Planet cards are higher priority. \"Seed Money\" at $10 isn't ideal because I'm in debt, so I won't be able to earn interest until I get back above zero.\n\nSo, the optimal move is to buy the \"Mega Celestial Pack\" for $8. That leaves me at -$7, but it's within my -$20 debt limit. I'm going to run the command: `buy_booster 1`.\n\nThe JSON for this shop action should be:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
