{"reasoning":"**The Grind Begins**\n\nAlright, let's see what we've got. Ante 3/8, Big Blind at 3000 – the game's afoot! Money's tight, just $2, but we've got some powerful Jokers. First up, \"Ride the Bus,\" which is key here, especially early on. It gains mult when we *don't* play a face card. I want to build that up over the next few hands. Then, we have \"Acrobat\" which multiplies the final hand, and \"Greedy Joker\" is giving +3 for Diamonds.  Lastly, \"Midas Mask\" turns face cards to gold, but it's not a priority here.\n\nMy hand: Jack of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs, 9 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds (Lucky!), and 10 of Diamonds. I've also got four hands and four discards.  My goal is 3000 chips.  My High Card is Level 3, pair is 1, two pair is 1 - High Card has to be my hand type.\n\nThe immediate play is clear: I need to scale the \"Ride the Bus.\" I have to think about this in terms of the long game and how to use the jokers to their best advantage. I want to discard the Jack to find better non-face cards or a stronger hand later. I've got two pair, but it's not worth it -  High Card is going to be my money maker here.  I need to maximize the use of \"Ride the Bus\" and then trigger \"Acrobat\" on the final hand. So, my strategy is to get a lot of mult with non-face cards, then get a huge multiplier with the last hand.\n\nOkay, let's get into it.  First, let's consider playing the 10 of Clubs. High Card: (25 + 10) * (3 + 19) = ~770 chips.  But if I use the 10 of Diamonds? That gets the \"Greedy Joker\". So, the 10 of Diamonds (875). Let's go with that. Let's see...  I'm going to play the Ace of Diamonds - it's a diamond, which works with \"Greedy Joker,\" and a High Card hand.\n\nI'm playing the Ace of Diamonds as a high card to optimize both the Level 3 bonus and the \"Greedy Joker.\"\n\nBase Chips: 25. Ace gives me 11. 36 chips.\nBase Mult: 3. Greedy Joker = +3, current Ride the Bus = 18.\nTotal Mult: 3 + 3 + 18 = 24.\nChips: 36 * 24 = 864.  Let's estimate 850, give or take. The target estimate is 864.  Alright, let's do this. I'm going to discard the Jack and see what the next draw brings. I might have just given a huge profit. Here goes nothing.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [7]"}
