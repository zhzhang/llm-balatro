{"reasoning":"**The Algorithm Awakens**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm facing down \"The Hook\" boss blind in round 8. I need to hit 4000 chips, and I only have four hands to do it with. My current hand size is limited to 7, due to the boss's effect, and I'm starting with zero chips. I've got a decent hand: an 8 of Spades, another 8 of Clubs, and some other cards. I'm rocking a few Jokers: \"Ride the Bus,\" \"Acrobat,\" \"Midas Mask,\" and \"Greedy Joker.\"\n\nThe core strategy here is clear: maximize my chips and make sure I hit the target. \"Ride the Bus\" is my golden ticket – it gives me a multiplier boost each consecutive round I *don't* play a face card. \"Acrobat\" is a powerful finisher, tripling my final hand's multiplier. \"Greedy Joker\" offers a bonus for Diamonds. \"Midas Mask\" can turn face cards into gold. I'll need to figure out how to best leverage them.\n\nFirst, I analyze my hand. I've got a pair of 8s, which is a start, but no flushes or straights. The high card strategy is looking pretty good, but I have a couple of face cards I don't want to play.\n\nIf I play the pair, it's a decent start, but the high card strategy, especially when boosted by \"Ride the Bus,\" looks much better. Playing a face card right now is a terrible idea. It wipes my \"Ride the Bus\" multiplier.\n\nDiscards are tempting, especially given the chance to get Diamonds for \"Greedy Joker,\" but I have limited discards. I need to get rid of those face cards without losing out on scaling my \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nI'm aiming to get about 1000 chips per hand to hit my target. Based on the value of my current cards, playing the high card (with the 8 as the highest) seems like the most consistent and promising play. Plus, I don't have to discard. Playing it right away will net a good amount, and keep \"Ride the Bus\" growing.\n\nThe real key here is to leverage \"Ride the Bus\" for consistent growth, and then use \"Acrobat\" at the end to maximize my final score.\n\nTherefore, playing the 8 as a High Card (level 4) is the best play. I should play several cards from my hand: 8 (Spades), and a few low cards and see what I get. I want to keep the Jack, 8, 7, and Queen in my hand. Then I discard the low-value cards and play again.\n\nI analyze the best hand: I play the 8 from the hand as a high card. Base 35 chips, 4 Mult. The card is +8, the Joker is +20, giving me 43 Chips * 24 Mult. It will make around 1032, and the \"Ride the Bus\" bonus grows to 21. This is a very safe strategy to hit the target.\n\nI will play the 8 and 3 other non-face cards from the hand. It scores about 1032 chips. \"Ride the Bus\" goes to +21.\n\nHere's the plan: Play the 8 of Spades and other cards to thin my hand and generate a decent score, discard to fish for good cards, and use \"Acrobat\" at the end.\n\nAction: Play. Cards: [8, 5, 3, 7].\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,7]"}
