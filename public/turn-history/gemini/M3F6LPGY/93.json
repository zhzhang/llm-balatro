{"reasoning":"**Round 10: Blind Select (Boss - The Arm)**\n\nAlright, here's the situation. I'm down $14, need 10,000 chips, and facing \"The Arm,\" which, as the description clearly states, *decreases the level of the poker hand I play*. Not \"The Eye\" as I initially thought. I have the following Jokers: Ride the Bus (+32 Mult, no face cards), Onyx Agate (+7 Mult for Clubs), Acrobat (x3 Mult on the final hand), Midas Mask (Face cards -> Gold, Negative), Credit Card (Debt limit -$20), and Sixth Sense (6 on first hand -> Spectral).\n\nMy current strategy is High Card, which is currently Level 5 (45 Chips, 5 Mult). The immediate problem is \"The Arm\". Each High Card played lowers the level.  So, if I play four High Cards, I’ll drop down to Level 1, which has only 1 Mult.\n\nMy initial thought is to play four High Cards, with the aim to maximize the last hand, using the Acrobat Joker. Let's see...\n\n*   **Hand 1:** High Card Level 5: (45 chips) * (5 mult + 32 Bus) = 45 * 37 = 1924\n*   **Hand 2:** High Card Level 4: (40 chips) * (4 mult + 32 Bus) = 47 * 36 = 1692\n*   **Hand 3:** High Card Level 3: (35 chips) * (3 mult + 32 Bus) = 42 * 35 = 1470\n*   **Hand 4:** (Acrobat x3) - if I assume level 2: 37 * 34 * 3 = 3774\n\nThe total is ~8850. Hmm, that's not quite enough. I need to get as close as possible to 10000.\n\nThe key seems to be the Acrobat Joker on the final hand. So, my main thought is to focus on optimizing that last hand. The Onyx Agate is particularly interesting for this because it gives +7 mult for Clubs.\n\nIf I played a Club High Card, this would increase my score on that particular hand: (45+7) * (5+32+7) = 52 * 44 = 2288.\n\nMy order is: 1: Ride the Bus, 2: Onyx Agate, 3: Acrobat, 4: Midas Mask, 5: Credit Card, 6: Sixth Sense, which seems optimal since the xMult (Acrobat) is at the end.\n\nI'm in the Blind Select phase, so I need to `play_round`. No consumables to use.  Don't want to sell any Jokers yet.\n\nSo, the play is to `play_round` and go for High Card. Let's see if this plays out.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
