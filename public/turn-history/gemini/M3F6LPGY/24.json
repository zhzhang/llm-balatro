{"reasoning":"**Analysis: The Path to Negative Joker Dominance**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 2, Round 3, Blind Select phase. I've got two Jokers: Ride the Bus (scaling multiplier, needs non-face cards) and Acrobat (final hand multiplier). I also have a couple of consumables, Strength and The Magician, but I can't use them yet since I'm not in a hand. Currently holding $1, facing the Small Blind (800 chips).\n\nMy initial thought was to play the round. The reward is $3 and a chance to scale Ride the Bus (potentially +2-4 mult) and make more money, but then I remember the Negative Tag. It lets me grab a free Negative Joker in the next base edition shop, and those are game-changers due to the Joker limit. It's a huge power spike, especially this early in the game. I could try to scale Ride the Bus more, but a free Joker is almost always worth more than a few points of mult.\n\nThe Small Blind is 800 chips, the Big Blind is 1200, and I’m confident I can handle the Big Blind with my current build. The Big Blind is 1200, I can use Acrobat to trigger x3 on final hand.\n\nOkay, let's look at the options again. Skip for the Negative Tag, or play? If I skip, I get the Negative Joker, plain and simple. If I play, I risk missing that opportunity for a little extra money and Ride the Bus scaling. But the Joker slot is the *true* prize here. It's too tempting to pass up a \"free\" Joker this early.\n\nWait, the Boss's debuff. The Pillar makes all cards I played on previous rounds weaker. If I skip, I just go straight to the Big Blind then to the Boss. If I play, I will need to be careful to avoid playing good cards for the boss round.\n\nNow, wait a minute, the action is `skip_round`. I am looking at the action documentation, and `skip_round` is valid for the BLIND_SELECT phase. I confirmed that I cannot use the Strength or Magician consumable here (no cards).\n\nTherefore, I have no reason *not* to skip. Ride the Bus is already at a good enough multiplier. The Negative tag is the priority. I also looked at the chips for each round to double check if I could take each round, so I can save cards in order to win the boss round.\n\nHere's the plan: **Action: `skip_round`**. I'm skipping the Small Blind to trigger the Negative Tag, securing a free Negative Joker in the next shop and increasing my Joker limit, making me significantly stronger long-term.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
