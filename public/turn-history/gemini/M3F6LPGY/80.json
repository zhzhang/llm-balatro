{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis - Ante 4**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm in the Shop after winning the Small Blind. Money's tight at -$10, and my debt limit is -$20, leaving me with $10 of wiggle room.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the options. \n\n*   **Onyx Agate:** A solid +7 Mult for Clubs. I've got Greedy Joker (+3 Diamonds), but this is a substantial upgrade, especially considering my focus on non-face card plays for Ride the Bus.\n*   **Sixth Sense:** Potentially game-breaking. If I play a single 6 first hand, it'll destroy that card and create a Spectral. This means an Ankh for a double-boosted Joker or a Hex to double the score or something! The risk/reward here is very high.\n*   **Standard Pack:** Could provide useful cards like a 6 for Sixth Sense, or cards that boost Ride the Bus.\n*   **Seed Money:** Useless, since I'm in debt, and it would take a long time to get that.\n\nMy current Jokers are solid: Ride the Bus is the main engine, Acrobat adds a multiplier, Midas Mask might help with money in the long run. Greedy Joker is okay, and the Credit Card is just a safety net for debt.\n\nNow, the math. Buying Onyx Agate costs $7. I'll be at -$17. I'm close to the limit. Should I sell Greedy Joker? It gives me $2. This will give me $5 to spend on standard packs. \n\nOnyx Agate provides consistent and substantial power. I'm leaning toward it, but the uncertainty of Sixth Sense is also tempting. I need a single 6 to proc it.\n\nThe plan:\nI need a +7 Mult Joker now that Ride the Bus is scaling. This will help with damage.\n\nSo I'll buy Onyx Agate. I can still sell Greedy Joker for $2, and it's a small investment to try to find a card in the Standard Pack.\n\nHere's the final action, buying Onyx Agate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_card\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
