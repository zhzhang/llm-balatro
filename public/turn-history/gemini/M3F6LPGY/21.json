{"reasoning":"**The Ante is Rising: Shop Decisions**\n\nOkay, so I've just taken down the boss in Ante 2, and now I'm in the shop. I've got $5 to work with. My deck's got some potential – Ride the Bus is my main multiplier right now, and Acrobat is my finisher. I need to make some smart choices here.\n\nLet's break down the options. I see Mars, which buffs Four of a Kind, but I haven't even played that hand yet, so it's not ideal right now. To Do List for Two Pair? Seems risky since I'm mostly riding the High Card train, and I risk resetting Ride the Bus if I use Face Cards.\n\nThe Arcana Pack is looking appealing. Three Tarot cards for $4, and these can really turn a run around – I could find an Enhancement, a Hermit for cash, or something to immediately boost my score. I *could* save my money for $1 interest, which is a solid 20% return, but Ante 2 will be a bigger jump in chip requirements. I need a power boost now.\n\nI'm leaning towards the Arcana Pack to give me the best chance at a significant upgrade. I'm going to take that gamble to give myself more options.\n\nOkay, let's execute this plan. The action is to \"buy_booster\", and the Arcana Pack is at position 2 in the \"Shop Boosters\". Checking the schema, the action looks like it's `buy_booster` with position `2`. I can afford it, so let's do it! This will give me Tarot choices to play with in the *next* state, so let's see what happens.\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
