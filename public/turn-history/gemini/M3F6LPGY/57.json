{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis & Investment**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 3, Round 7, fresh off the Big Blind, with $8 in my pocket. My current Joker setup is centered around \"Ride the Bus\" (+20 Mult, scaling with non-face hands), \"Acrobat\" (X3 on final hand), \"Midas Mask\" (Gold face cards, but potentially anti-synergistic with Ride the Bus since I need non-face cards), and \"Greedy Joker\" (+3 Mult for Diamonds). I've got a decent, if slightly restrictive, engine going. My main hands are High Card (Level 3) and Three of a Kind (Level 1).\n\nThe shop's tempting. I've got two \"Sly Jokers\" offering chip boosts on Pairs and a \"Zany Joker\" which provides Mult on Three of a Kinds, but my real focus is on scaling my existing setup.\n\nThe real meat of the decision lies in the shop's Boosters: two Celestial Packs at $4 each. I need to level up my hands.\n\n\"Ride the Bus\" absolutely thrives on base chip/mult increases from Planet cards. \"Acrobat\" also appreciates these increases. Given my current hand strategy, leveling High Card (with Pluto) is critical. Venus (Three of a Kind) and Mercury (Pair) are also good. The long-term payoff from those Planet cards is enormous.\n\nHere's my logic: I'm buying the first Celestial Pack. I'm going to scan the contents of that pack. Then, if I still have money left, I'm going to buy the second one. Permanent hand levels trump temporary Joker bonuses right now. The other cards are just not providing nearly enough long-term value.\n\nFinal action: `buy_booster`, `positions: [1]`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
