{"reasoning":"**Final Shop Decision: Prudent Debt Management**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 10, and I'm staring down -$14 in the bank. The Credit Card has me covered up to -$20, but that's a tightrope walk I don't want to make a habit of. The goal is to beat Ante 8, and the current strategy is a High Card build, heavily leveraging Ride the Bus (+32 Mult), Acrobat (x3 final hand), and Onyx Agate (+7 Mult for Clubs). Sixth Sense is there as a potential deck-thinner/Spectral generator, though the shop is offering nothing that synergises well with it.\n\nI've got a few options in this shop, but none of them are screaming \"must-buy.\" The Joker for +4 Mult? Tempting, but I'm already at 6/6 Jokers, and selling one of my core Jokers (Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Onyx Agate) is out of the question. Buying Earth to level up Full House is a non-starter. I'm mainly using High Card.\n\nThe big-ticket items are the Standard Pack and the Buffoon Pack. The Standard Pack exactly hits my debt limit, and while a purple seal or a Club or 6 might be useful, it's not worth the risk. The Buffoon Pack for $4 might provide a better Joker than Sixth Sense (which is inconsistent) or Onyx Agate, but given the current debt, the risk is too high. I could sell a joker and buy it - but the most important Joker (Credit Card) can't be sold while in debt.\n\nRealistically, given the current financial constraints and the unremarkable shop offerings, the best move is to save the $6 debt capacity, clear the current debt, and start generating interest. None of the shop items have a high impact in my current strategy. I can confirm this by rechecking the values of my current build, and I am safely above the typical score needed for Ante 4 Boss. There is no reason to risk a deck purchase at this point.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable decision is to select `round_select` and press on.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
