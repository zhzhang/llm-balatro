{"reasoning":"**A Strategic Dance with Decks and Debuffs**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4, Big Blind. I'm starting from zero, but the goal is a manageable 1200 chips in just four hands. \"The Pillar\" is looming, so anything played in this round gets debuffed against the boss. I'm holding a strong hand with four Aces (two Lucky ones!), two 8s, and two 4s. I also have the \"Ride the Bus\" Joker, primed at +8 Mult, which gains +1 for each non-face card hand, and the \"Acrobat\" Joker, promising x3 Mult on the final hand. I'm holding all the Aces (2 of them lucky), and that's the core of my thinking here.\n\nThe obvious play is the Four of a Kind of Aces – a guaranteed win, but at a huge cost: the debuff for the Boss round. It's a tempting strategy to play the Aces now, but it's a massive risk as \"The Pillar\" will debuff them. If I play them now, they are useless in the boss round, so I can't use them. But, to discard them is the safe move; if I discard them now, they are reshuffled into the deck and are available later.\n\nLet's make some moves without the Aces. The Two Pair (8s and 4s) is a decent starting point. The idea is to reach 1200 using a few non-face cards as possible, and not have the aces debuffed in the boss round. I could score about 484 chips on this hand, and gain +1 from Ride the Bus in the coming round.\n\nIf I play these cards and get non-face cards, I can keep scaling \"Ride the Bus\" for the boss round. Since I want to save the Aces, I'll play the 8s and 4s as a Two Pair. And then, whatever the draw gives me, I'll go with it.\n\nI should discard the aces right away and avoid playing them. Then I'll focus on the remaining cards for this round.\n\nDiscard the 4 Aces. Now I'll draw four cards. Then I can continue.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,8]"}
