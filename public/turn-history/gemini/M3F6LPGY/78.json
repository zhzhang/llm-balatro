{"reasoning":"**Strategic Play to Maximize Ride the Bus and Acrobat**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. The current ante is 4/8, and I need 5000 chips. I have 3524 chips, so I need to acquire 1476 more. I've got a couple of hands left, and my debt is a minor concern at -$13, manageable with the small blind payout.\n\nI'm focused on maximizing the \"Ride the Bus\" joker, which scales up Mult with non-face card hands, currently +26. I also have \"Acrobat,\" which triples the Mult on the final hand of the round, and \"Greedy Joker\" that gives +3 Mult for scored Diamonds.\n\nMy hand consists of a QS, 4S, 3H, 2H, JC, 8C, 4C, and JD. I have a consumable \"The Star\" that converts cards to Diamonds, which I'll save for now.\n\nThe primary objective is to get my Ride the Bus scaling up to maximize the Acrobat. I need to get as much Multiplier out of the hands as possible.\n\nThe strategy here is to play the *lowest* scoring hand I can, just to push over the need, which will maximize my Ride the Bus scaling. Currently, if I play a High Card, even a small card, I win immediately, which doesn't help Ride the Bus or Acrobat. So, playing the pair of 4s should allow me to use the Acrobat ability.\n\nI've got a pair of 4's. Playing those cards yields a \"pair\" hand, which is base 25, plus card chips 4 + 4, totaling 33 chips. My current Ride the Bus is +26. After this hand, the base Mult is 3, which totals 3 + 27 * 33 = 990 chips. Adding that to the 3524 chips brings me to 4514. I'll play the 2 of hearts, which scales the Ride the Bus to +27, which gets the total score to 4981.\n\nI will then play a scoring hand, the 8C, which is a face card.\n\nSince I am playing for the long game, using these hands to scale, the current *intended* play is: play a pair of 4s (positions 2 and 7) for a result of 990 chips. This is not enough to win, but it's enough to get me to a high value.\n\nThis plan achieves the following:\n\n1.  Scales Ride the Bus from +26 to +27, and then +28.\n2.  Sets up the final hand for Acrobat, getting a x3 Mult at the last hand.\n3.  Doesn't use consumables.\n\nThus, the play is to play a pair of 4s, which is a pair of spades (pos 2) and clubs (pos 7). The estimated chip total from this hand is 990.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,7]"}
