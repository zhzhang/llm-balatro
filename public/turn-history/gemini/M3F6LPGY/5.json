{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Early Game: A Strategic Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 1, Round 1. I've got \"Ride the Bus\" Joker, which scales with consecutive hands *without* face cards. My current money is $6. The shop offers a photograph, which is a multiplier on the first face card played, but conflicts with my Joker. Saturn, which boosts Straights, and a Celestial Pack are also available.\n\nThe Photograph is a no-go with \"Ride the Bus.\" Saturn is okay, but I'm not focused on Straights at this point. The Celestial Pack, at $4, seems like the best bet. It gives me a guaranteed planet to improve my hand. This seems like a better bet than the low chance of finding a straight early.\n\nI have $6. Spending $4 on the Celestial Pack leaves me with $2, and $1 interest. I lose $1 interest by buying the pack, but the immediate power of the planet is likely worth it to get past the Big Blind and any early Boss.\n\nSo the plan is: `buy_booster 1` (Celestial Pack). That will improve my base stats without relying on face cards, letting me capitalize on the \"Ride the Bus\" Joker. The index for the Celestial Pack is `1` in *this* shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
