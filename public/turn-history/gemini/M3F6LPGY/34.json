{"reasoning":"**Strategic Tarot Selection: A Balatro Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so we're in Ante 4, with the Arcana Pack. I have $3, three Jokers: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, and the Midas Mask (a tricky one), and the option for a Tarot card. I need to make a solid choice to maximize scoring and prepare for the boss blind.\n\nThe options are: The Wheel of Fortune, The High Priestess, and The Tower.\n\n*   *Wheel of Fortune*: This is the ultimate gamble. A 25% chance for a game-changing edition on a Joker (like Polychrome or Holographic on Ride the Bus or Acrobat). But it's risky.\n\n*   *The High Priestess*: My gut is leading me here. Two guaranteed Planet cards! These can level up my hand types, which is huge early on.\n\n*   *The Tower*: One Stone card that adds chips and bypasses rank/suit considerations. Okay, not ideal.\n\n*   **Joker Analysis:** *Ride the Bus* is the breadwinner, at +10 Mult, but resets on face cards. *Acrobat* is x3 Mult on my final hand, which is valuable. *Midas Mask* creates Gold cards from face cards, which feels like a trap. I have to play face cards to make them gold. I should avoid it. It also grants +1 Joker slot and $3/round if held? That's useful, but I'm worried it will conflict with *Ride the Bus*.\n\n*   **Conflict Resolution:** My immediate thought is, should I stick to *Ride the Bus* (no face cards) or pivot to *Midas Mask* (play face cards). Then, I remembered *Vampire* is in the shop for $12. Since I only have $3, that's not an option.\n\n*   **Planetary Guidance:** High Priestess gives planets. Let's see. If I get planets for High Card or Pair, my most frequent hand levels, that's a massive, guaranteed boost. *Wheel of Fortune* is a 25% shot at glory. The Tower, not so impactful. I already got a *Four of a Kind - 3,848 chips*\n\n*   **Decision Time:** I'm going with The High Priestess. The consistency of two Planet cards outweighs the potential but uncertain upside of the *Wheel*. I'm leaning toward consistent progress.\n\n*   **Final Scrutiny:** Let me double-check. The *Midas Mask* description is odd - it says \"if held in hand\". It makes money if I keep it. That's a good mod effect. I don't think it changes my choice. I still choose High Priestess.\n\n*   **Joker Rearrangement:** I think I should check the Joker order. *Ride the Bus* then *Acrobat* is the correct order. The base mult is (Base + 10) * 3, and not the (Base * 3) + 10. That's good.\n\n*   **Confirmation:** *High Priestess* it is. I select position 2. This is the correct action.\n\n*   **Final Review:** I have confirmed I must select one tarot.\nI have already confirmed High Priestess is the correct tarot to choose.\nI am taking High Priestess.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
