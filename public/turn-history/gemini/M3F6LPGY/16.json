{"reasoning":"**Round 2: Boss Blind - Let's Get This Done**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 1/8, Round 2, Boss Blind. I'm starting with zero money, which means no rerolls or consumables – not ideal, but we'll work with it. The good news is I have a couple of Jokers: Ride the Bus, which is a solid +4 Mult that scales nicely with non-face hands, and Acrobat, a potentially game-winning x3 Mult on the final hand. The Boss Blind debuffs Hearts, meaning they won't score chips directly, but can still contribute to hand formation. I need to hit 600 chips to clear this.\n\nMy initial thoughts are centered on efficiency. I'm at the Blind Select screen, I know I have to play this round. The schema is straightforward: I need to specify an \"action\", and optionally, positions, hand type, and estimated chips. I initially thought to skip over this.\n\nAfter a quick mental review, I've got two Jokers in the right positions, an Additive one and then a Multiplicative. I can't reroll, so I have no real decisions to make.\n\nThe optimal play is clear: I'm going to **play_round**. So, I'll go ahead and execute that action.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
