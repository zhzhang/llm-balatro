{"reasoning":"**The Sixth Sense Acquisition Plan**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop after the Small Blind, with Ante 4. My primary goal, as always, is to maximize my chip gain this blind. I have a debt of -$15 and a limit of -$20. I need $6 to buy Sixth Sense, which is crucial because it gives me access to Spectral cards. Those are my key to scaling up since I'm running low on cash. I also want to make sure I sell something that I don't need since I'm on a negative budget.\n\nCurrently, I've got a decent Joker setup: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask (though that's a negative, but adds a Joker slot), Credit Card, and Onyx Agate. I have 5 Jokers out of a possible 6, with my *effective* total being 5 of 6. I also have \"The Star\", which I rarely ever use. I have one consumable slot open.\n\nThe plan is straightforward: I need to buy Sixth Sense, which is in the shop for $6. The Star is essentially useless to me in my current setup, since I had a Joker that benefited from diamonds, but it's no longer present. So, I will sell \"The Star\" for $1, which will bring my debt to -$14. Then, I can purchase Sixth Sense for $6. This will put me at the edge of my budget at -$20, but it will allow me to access Spectral cards.\n\nI am at position 1 (first item in the consumables list). I'm confident in this move. With the new plan, I confirm I can perform this, so I will sell the item and buy the Sixth Sense card. I will now submit.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"sell_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
