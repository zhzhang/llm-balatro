{"reasoning":"**Okay, here's the plan. It's Round 8, the final hand. I've got a Boss blind to beat and I need to score 1033 chips.**\n\nI've got a hand of cards, and a few Jokers that can help me: \"Ride the Bus\" (which gives me a multi-boost with non-face card hands), \"Acrobat\" (which gives a x3 multi on this final hand), \"Midas Mask\" (which has a negative effect, that it can turn played face cards into gold), and \"Greedy Joker\" (which gives bonus multipliers to diamond cards).\n\nThe goal is to play a hand that gets me past the chip target. I have face cards in my hand (Jack, Queen). I want to avoid scoring face cards to keep that \"Ride the Bus\" multiplier high, so let's stick to using the non-face cards in the hand.\n\nI've got a \"Lucky\" Ace of Diamonds, which is the clear best card. I'll need to play High Card with it. The best option is to play the Ace of Diamonds as the High Card. I can add the other non-face cards (10 of Hearts and 7 of Diamonds) just to use them.\n\nWith that, I've got:\n\n*   Base chips: 35\n*   Ace of Diamonds Chip Bonus: +11\n*   Base Mult: 4\n*   Ride the Bus: +23\n*   Greedy Joker: +3 (since the Ace is a diamond)\n*   Acrobat will trigger since it's the final hand: x3 mult.\n\nMy goal is a total of 4140 chips to clear the target.\n\nI'll check the logic one last time. There's no benefit to discarding here, with the target cleared easily. My face cards are worth $3 at the end of the round if I keep them in my hand thanks to Midas Mask. Let's keep those cards, and get some extra cash!\n\nSo, to recap: I'm playing the Ace of Diamonds (6) as the High Card with 10 of Hearts (3) and 7 of Diamonds (7). I'm confident that should do the trick.\n\nAll clear! Let's play.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [6,3,7]"}
