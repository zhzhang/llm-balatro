{"reasoning":"**My Strategy: Choosing the Right Booster**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` and my last move was buying a booster. Currently I have `$2` and my inventory includes `Ride the Bus`, which is a Common Joker with a base mult of 0, but it scales up by +1 for each non-face card in my hand. My booster choices are: `Neptune`, `Jupiter`, and `Uranus`. I need to reach 450 for the Big Blind and 600 for the Boss in Ante 1.\n\nI need to make a decision quickly. `Ride the Bus` clearly steers me towards non-face cards. `Neptune` for Straight Flushes is a tempting, high-scoring option, but it's *way* too hard to pull off while avoiding face cards.\n\n`Jupiter` (Flush) and `Uranus` (Two Pair) are both viable. I won the Small Blind with a Flush, so Flushes seem doable. I need to prioritize building my Joker, and `Ride the Bus` needs as many hands played as possible, with no face cards in them. Flushes are relatively easy, especially with low cards. Two Pair is reliable but scores lower.\n\nI'm ruling out `Neptune`. The choice is between `Jupiter` and `Uranus`. `Jupiter` provides more base mult, which will be crucial early on. If I get `Jupiter`, it will take my Flush from level 1 (35 chips, 4 mult) to level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult), while `Uranus` would upgrade my Two Pair from level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) to level 2 (40 chips, 3 mult). The higher initial mult provided by `Jupiter` is the better play, and this fits my play style.\n\nSo, I'm going with `Jupiter`. The command is `select 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
