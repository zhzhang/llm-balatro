{"reasoning":"**My Turn, My Thoughts**\n\nOkay, let's see where we are. Ante 3/8, Round 5. Need to be sure; last turn was the Boss, then a Shop. And back in the shop. I have a whopping $2. Let's see what's on offer and how this hand looks.\n\nI've got Ride the Bus for +14 Mult if no face cards score, Acrobat for x3 final hand, and Midas Mask, which turns face cards gold. Ah, the Midas Mask. A bit of a conundrum here, with Ride the Bus wanting to avoid scoring face cards and Midas Mask making face cards gold upon *scoring*. But gold cards give money when held. It's a conflict I'll need to carefully consider. High Card is Level 3, giving 25 chips and 3 mult.\n\nNow for the Shop. I can't afford Earth, Jupiter, a Jumbo Standard Pack, Paint Brush, or even a reroll. Everything's $3 or more, and I have just $2. No consumables, nothing to sell. I'm completely locked out. The only play is to move to the next round. So, `round_select` it is. No other actions are possible here. I am stuck! Let's hope things improve next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
