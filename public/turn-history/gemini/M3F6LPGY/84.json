{"reasoning":"**Balatro Decision Time**\n\nOkay, so the game wants me to pick the next move. Let's see... I'm at Ante 4 of 8, Round 9, right in the shop phase. Things are a bit tight, I'm at -$20, which is the absolute limit thanks to that Credit Card, so no wiggle room there.\n\nI've got six Jokers in play: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask (which is kind of a dud right now), the Credit Card (lifesaver!), Onyx Agate, and Sixth Sense. The shop? Not much to look at. Two Standard Packs at $4 each (forget it), a Seed Money Voucher for $10 (also a no-go), and I just bought Sixth Sense. Reroll is out of the question, too expensive.\n\nRealistically, I can't buy anything. I'm maxed out on debt. So, the only possible move is to go to the next round. My plan is to start with a single 6 to trigger Sixth Sense, hoping to get some spectral cards out of it.\n\nI should probably rearrange my Jokers, though. I *always* want to optimize the additive multipliers before the multiplicative ones. So, Ride the Bus (+28 Mult), Onyx Agate (+7 per club), and then Acrobat (x3).\n\nThe prompt says played cards and modifiers come before the held-in-hand bonuses.\n\nSo the score order should be: Played Cards -> Ride the Bus -> Onyx Agate -> Acrobat (on the final hand).\n\nCurrent: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask, Credit Card, Onyx Agate, Sixth Sense.\n\nIdeally, the order would be: Ride the Bus, Onyx Agate, Acrobat. The Midas Mask and Credit Card don't affect scoring.\n\nBut, I'm in the shop. I can rearrange, but I can't *do* anything else.\n\nLet's do the Joker shuffle to optimize.\n1. Ride the Bus\n2. Onyx Agate\n3. Acrobat\n4. Midas Mask\n5. Credit Card\n6. Sixth Sense\n\nSince I'm in the shop, I might as well rearrange the Jokers now. It's the most efficient thing to do.\n\nOkay, let's just go to the next round, there's nothing else I can do right now. Action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
