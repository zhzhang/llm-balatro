{"reasoning":"**Current Thinking: Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the middle of a Celestial Pack, round 3 of 7. The goal here is straightforward: pick the planet card that best fits my current build. Let's see... I've got a few jokers working for me: Ride the Bus, which is all about non-face hands; Acrobat, which gives a nice multiplier on the final hand; Midas Mask, negating the face cards (which I need to be careful of); and Greedy Joker, which is handy with diamonds.\n\nRight now, I'm playing a lot of High Card; it's already Level 3 and it's been played 13 times. I have a Three of a Kind at Level 1 that has been played just once. Ride the Bus strongly favors sticking with low-risk hands, like High Card or Pairs, to keep the streak going.\n\nNow, the pack options: Pluto, Mars, and Earth.\n\n*   **Pluto (High Card):** Leveling up High Card is really the core of my current strategy. It boosts the mult and chips, making the \"default\" hand stronger, which in turn benefits from Ride the Bus. This seems like the obvious play.\n*   **Mars (Four of a Kind):** This would be super powerful, but it's tough to hit consistently.\n*   **Earth (Full House):** A solid hand, but harder to hit than High Card, and there's the risk of including face cards which is what I don't want, because Ride the Bus resets if I play face cards.\n\nGiven how much I'm leaning on High Card and the synergy with Ride the Bus, Pluto is the clear winner. Leveling it up just makes the entire operation more efficient and reliable.\n\nSo, the action is \"select\", the position is 1 (Pluto). I don't strictly need to specify an intended hand type, since I'm not playing a hand right now, but the schema allows `null`. I'll just keep the value of `null` there. I'm not estimating any chips yet either.\n\nThe JSON should be pretty simple:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nOkay, let's just make sure this is all valid JSON and ready to go. No comments, no control tokens, everything double-quoted, and it follows the schema... Yep, all good. Final check: Pluto is in position 1, I want to select Pluto. Done.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
