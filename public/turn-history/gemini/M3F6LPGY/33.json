{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decisions**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 2, Round 4, with $7 and the shop open. The main goal, as always, is to maximize my scoring potential. I have some interesting Jokers: \"Ride the Bus\" which is fantastic (+10 Mult, resets on scoring face cards), \"Acrobat\" which offers a x3 Multiplier on the final hand, and the tricky \"Midas Mask\" (face cards become Gold cards when scored, adds a joker slot, but has a negative effect). I'm currently capped at 6 Jokers.\n\nThe shop is tempting. There's a \"Vampire\" card (Polychrome, x1.5 Multiplier, and grows by x0.1 per enhancement removed) that I would *love*, but it costs $12 – too rich for my blood right now. The Vampire has great synergy with Midas Mask, but Midas Mask adds a conflict to my current Ride the Bus strat - so I would eventually have to pivot.\n\nMy initial thought was to consider selling my current jokers, Ride the Bus and Acrobat, to afford the Vampire, but that's too risky this early.\n\nI need to see what I can get now. So, looking at the boosters, I have an \"Arcana Pack\" and a \"Standard Pack\", both at $4. The Arcana Pack is generally better for the long game or immediate utility, offering Tarot cards that can enhance, generate money, or help with deck manipulation. The Standard Pack gives playing cards - not as valuable.\n\nWith my $7, buying the Arcana Pack leaves me with $3. Saving for interest isn't worth it at this point, as it would only net me $1. Since there are potentially higher value returns from the Arcana pack.\n\nThen I realized that I need to confirm the *Midas Mask*/*Ride the Bus* conflict. If I play a face card, Midas Mask creates an enhancement, but this causes *Ride the Bus* to reset.\n\nGiven the potential of the Arcana Pack to help me now (and with the \"The Pillar\" Boss blind potentially coming up soon), I'm going to buy the Arcana Pack.\n\nI'm now buying the Arcana Pack.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
