{"reasoning":"**The Strategy is Set**\n\nOkay, here's the plan. Ante 1/8, Boss Blind is active, and I need 600 chips to win. Hearts are debuffed, so I'll minimize their impact. I've got two Jokers: Ride the Bus, which I'll build up by avoiding scoring face cards, and Acrobat, which I'll save for a massive multiplier on the final hand. My starting hand is: 8s, 4s, Qh, 5h, Ac, Kc, 9c, 2c. I can see the potential to build a Flush here with more Clubs or Spades. Let's make the best use of the cards I have.\n\nHand 1 is all about building Ride the Bus. I need to play a hand without face cards that score so it doesn't reset. I'll discard strategically. \n\nLet's discard the Qh, Kc, 5h, 4s, and 2c. I want to draw in some good cards. \n\nI'll play [8s, 4s, Ac, 9c, 2c] as a \"High Card\", with the Ace as my lead. No scoring face cards! The Ace is the highest card.\n\nThis means Ride the Bus will go to +5 from +4! Chips will be (5 base + 11 Ace) * (1 base + 4 Ride the Bus) = 80 chips. This is great for the start. 80 is a good base for starting and I can make this play to get ride the bus going. \n\nI'll play three more hands to build this joker and save the final hand for Acrobat, for maximum score. I'll save any discards to get a better hand as possible, maybe a Flush.\n\nAll right, let's play the Ace of Clubs hand, and see what the next draw gets me.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,7,8]"}
