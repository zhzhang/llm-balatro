{"reasoning":"**Analysis of the Boss Blind: The Hook**\n\nOkay, I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase for the Boss Blind of Ante 3, \"The Hook,\" which I understand means I'm facing a -1 hand size. I need to hit 4000 chips, and I'm starting with nothing – $0. Let's see, my Jokers are: Ride the Bus (+20 Mult, gains +1 if no scoring face card), Acrobat (X3 Mult on final hand), Midas Mask (makes Face cards Gold), and Greedy Joker (+3 Mult for Diamonds). My hand levels are High Card 4 (35 Chips, 4 Mult) and Flush 3 (65 Chips, 8 Mult).\n\nThe immediate goal is to reach that 4000 chip threshold. My only options, considering the lack of consumables, are `play_round` or `rearrange_jokers`. I'll glance at my current Joker order: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask (ugh), Greedy Joker.\n\nAlright, time to think this through. The scoring order is crucial: Boss effects, then \"On played\" Jokers, then the cards themselves score with all \"On Scored\" Jokers, then the held-in-hand Jokers, and finally, my Independent Jokers.\n\nI remember Ride the Bus and Acrobat, they are Independent Jokers. \"Independent Jokers\" activate left-to-right. Now, I want Ride the Bus's +20 Mult to happen *before* Acrobat's X3 Mult is applied.\n\nSo, the current order looks like:\n1. Ride the Bus (+20 Mult)\n2. Acrobat (X3 Mult)\nThis is optimal. Ride the Bus adds 20 to the mult total, and *then* Acrobat multiplies the final Mult by 3.\n\nBut hold on. Should I move Greedy Joker or Midas Mask? Greedy Joker adds a multiplier on score, and Midas Mask makes face cards Gold. Remember, the general scoring is calculated in this order:\n(Base Chips + Played Card Chips -> Total Chips)\n(Base Mult + Played Card Mult + On Scored Joker Mults -> Current Mult)\nThen Independent Jokers are processed left-to-right.\nIf an Independent Joker is +Mult, it adds to the current Mult.\nIf an Independent Joker is XMult, it multiplies the current Mult.\n\nI can confirm that if Ride the Bus (Independent +20) is at position 1 and Acrobat (Independent X3) is at position 2:\nMult = (Base + ...)\nMult = Mult + 20 (Ride the Bus)\nMult = Mult * 3 (Acrobat - only on last hand)\n\nIf I had the order reversed:\nMult = (Base + ...)\nMult = Mult * 3 (Acrobat)\nMult = Mult + 20 (Ride the Bus)\nThis would be strictly worse.\n\nThe order is:\n1: Ride the Bus (+20)\n2: Acrobat (X3)\n3: Midas Mask\n4: Greedy Joker\n\nGreedy Joker and Midas Mask are \"On scored\", so they trigger when the card scores during step 3. Ride the Bus and Acrobat are \"Independent\", and trigger during step 5.  Within step 5, they trigger left-to-right. So keeping Ride the Bus (position 1) before Acrobat (position 2) is optimal.\n\nSince my Joker order is optimal and I can't do anything with consumables, I will simply `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
