{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the State and Preparing for the Next Hand**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: We're in Ante 4, Round 10, with 2091 chips and a target of 7500. We've got three hands remaining and four discards available. I'm currently -$18, but that's manageable. Our Jokers are: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask (negative edition), Credit Card, Onyx Agate, and Sixth Sense. The key is to maximize the impact of Ride the Bus (no face cards), and Onyx Agate (Clubs). Acrobat triggers on the final hand, so we have to order the Jokers properly for it to work. We just sold the Ankh. The goal is to maximize the final hand's score.\n\nI need to get Ride the Bus and Onyx Agate working before Acrobat. I need to rearrange those Jokers. Currently, the order is: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask, Credit Card, Onyx Agate, Sixth Sense. This is bad. Acrobat has to be last or it'll multiply too early. The best order is: Ride the Bus, Onyx Agate, then Acrobat.\n\nThe ideal order is Ride, Onyx, then Acrobat. I've calculated the best play, based on current hand, to easily win the round. To do this, I must place Onyx and Ride before Acrobat. Acrobat is the x3 multiplier on the final hand. So, the correct action is to rearrange the Jokers, using the target positions: 1 (Ride), 5 (Onyx), 3 (Midas), 4 (Credit), 6 (Sixth), 2 (Acrobat).\n\nThe command I will send will be: `rearrange_jokers 1 5 3 4 6 2`. I will verify one more time. The command is `rearrange_jokers`, where the list contains the current index of the joker to move to that position. The order will be Ride, Onyx, Midas, Credit, Sixth, Acrobat.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"rearrange_jokers\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 5, 3, 4, 6, 2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,5,2,3,4,6]"}
