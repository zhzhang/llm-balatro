{"reasoning":"**Strategic Arcana Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the `TAROT_PACK` phase, with just $1 remaining. Let's break down these options. The goal, based on the current hand and the \"Ride the Bus\" / \"Acrobat\" setup, I need to either support the high card/pair strategy or improve the flush. I'm looking at the following Arcana cards:\n\n1.  `Ride the Bus`: +8 Mult (increases by +1 per consecutive hand without scoring face cards).\n2.  `Acrobat`: X3 Mult on the final hand of the round.\n3.  The hand cards are: `Ace of Spades`, `3 of Spades`, `7 of Hearts`, `2 of Hearts`, `8 of Clubs`, `Ace of Diamonds`, `Queen of Diamonds`, `9 of Diamonds`.\n\nThe pack contains:\n1.  `The World`: Converts up to 3 selected cards to Spades. Potentially useful for Flushes, but I've only got two Spades right now. Flush level is 2.\n2.  `The Fool`: Creates the last Tarot or Planet card used. The secondary description says it creates Jupiter (Flush level up), which is solid for scaling Flushes.\n3.  `The Emperor`: Creates 2 random Tarot cards, and my consumable slots are empty (0/2). This is where things get interesting.\n\nI know that `The Emperor` is generally the strongest pick early-to-mid game because it can fish for economy (Hermit/Temperance) or enhancements (Hierophant/Empress/Justice). `The Fool` (Jupiter) is good for immediate scaling of Flushes. `The World` is pretty situational, and my current hand doesn't scream \"Flush.\"\n\nConsidering the `Ride the Bus` strategy, \"The Emperor\" can give me two more chances at useful consumables like `The Hermit` ($) or `The Hanged Man` (thinning the deck, specifically face cards). I have to remember that `The Emperor` generates two random Tarots. This is almost always better than a single specific planet unless that planet is crucial. With $1 in the bank, finding a `Hermit` or `Temperance` would be a game-changer. So even though `The Fool` (Jupiter) is specific to Flushes, I think `The Emperor` is the best choice.\n\nHold on, something is not clear: the description of `The Fool` says \"Creates the last Tarot or Planet card used during this run The Fool excluded Jupiter.\" The description says `The Fool` will create `Jupiter`. But `The Emperor` is still generally better to build up resources.\n\nWait! The description for `The Emperor` says \"Creates up to 2 random Tarot cards (Must have room)\", and my inventory room is 0/2. Perfect! I can get two new cards.\n\n**Action: `select 3`.**\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
