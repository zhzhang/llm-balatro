{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Strategy: Ante 4/8, Round 10**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm at Ante 4/8, Round 10, staring down a target of 7500 chips with a meager 4401 in my pocket and a $18 debt to clear. Two hands left, four discards. Got to make this count.\n\nMy current jokers are: Ride the Bus (+30 Mult, scaling), Onyx Agate (+7 Mult for Clubs), Acrobat (x3 Mult on final hand), Midas Mask (Face cards become Gold), Credit Card (allowing debt), Sixth Sense (creating Spectral if the first hand is a single 6).\n\nRight now, my hand is: Q♠, 9♠, 5♠, 4♠, Q♦, 9♦, 8♦, 3♦. No Clubs, which is a bit of a concern. The main play is High Card (Level 5) -- 45 Chips, 5 Mult.\n\nI've got to play one hand before the final hand to trigger Acrobat for the x3 multiplier on the last hand.\n\nRide the Bus is key: it gains +1 Mult each hand I play without scoring a face card. Currently, it's at +30. I want to keep it going.\n\nLet's do some quick math:\n\n*   **Hand 1 (non-final):** Play the 9♠ (position 2). Chips: 45 (Base) + 9 (card) = 54. Mult: 5 (Base) + 30 (Ride the Bus) = 35. Score: 54 * 35 = 1890. I need another 3099 chips.\n*   **Hand 2 (final):** I'll be guaranteed to be above target, after the final hand I can ensure Onyx Agate is triggered if a club is drawn.\n\nDiscarding is an option to find a Club for the final hand. There are 12 Clubs in the deck. Playing a Club on the final hand would be: 55 Chips, +7 Mult (from Onyx), +31 from ride the bus, and x3 from Acrobat for the win!\n\nSo, the play is simple: Play the 9♠, keep Ride the Bus climbing, and find a club for the final hand with the discards. I can select up to 5 cards to play. But it only scores when the highest hand is played. Therefor just playing the 9♠ is ideal right now to ensure Ride the Bus is incremented.\n\nFinal score: 4401 (current) + 1890 (estimated hand) = 6291. Final hand should easily cover the remaining 1209 chips. With acrobat, I will be well above the requirement.\n\nNo face cards this round! Gotta protect Ride the Bus. This eliminates the need to consider Midas Mask, and Sixth Sense is irrelevant in this turn.\n\nLet's do it.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2]"}
