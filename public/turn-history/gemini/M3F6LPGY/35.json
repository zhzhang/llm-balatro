{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy: Maximizing Scoring Potential with Limited Resources**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 2, Round 4 with only $3. The shop is tempting, but I can't afford anything useful right now. I've got a couple of planet cards in my consumables – Pluto, which boosts High Card, and Earth, which boosts Full House. My initial assessment is that these are crucial for scaling up my hands. High Card is my go-to, and I've played it five times, so that upgrade is immediately attractive. Full House, while less frequent, offers a solid chip and multiplier boost.\n\nMy immediate goal is to optimize my current hand composition. I need to free up space and boost my base stats. Selling the consumables for cash is an option, but in the early game, those permanent hand level-ups are almost always more valuable. I'm thinking I should prioritize using the consumables over selling them for meager interest.\n\nI'm definitely going to use both consumables. Given that Pluto is in position 1 and Earth is in position 2, the plan is to use Pluto now. I'll execute the command `use_consumable 1`. I might consider the next one for the next turn, given the current hand. I will then use `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
