{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis and Action**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, $5 in the bank, and a hand built around High Card (Level 4). My Joker lineup is decent: \"Ride the Bus\" is fantastic, \"Acrobat\" provides multiplier, \"Midas Mask\" offers an extra Joker slot (though it costs for face cards, which I'll be careful to avoid), and \"Greedy Joker\" is great for Diamonds. The shop has \"Credit Card\" for only $1. The \"Star\" tarot card is available for $3, it converts cards to Diamonds. The \"Mega Celestial Pack\" is looking appealing and should help level up High Card (with Pluto). I can also see the \"Jumbo Standard Pack\", available for $6.\n\nMy immediate goal is to maximize scoring and establish an efficient economy. \"Ride the Bus\" and \"Greedy Joker\" are my current core Jokers. So, the \"Star\" which helps me make diamond cards, perfectly synergizes. Also, \"Credit Card\" for $1 is a no-brainer. This opens a significant liquidity buffer, letting me go into debt to afford the more expensive boosters later. I can buy the \"Credit Card\" and then go into debt to buy boosters.\n\nThe \"Credit Card\" is a must-buy, for only $1. I'll buy that first. Next I'll buy \"The Star\" to help with diamond conversion. I want to buy the \"Mega Celestial Pack\" to level up the High Card. I should buy \"Credit Card\" first, it is only $1 and expands my options. With $5, I can do this and still have $4. The best next move is buying the \"Star\". Then, I can take out debt.\n\nOkay, let's break it down. Action, buy the credit card.\n\nLet's do this:\n\n1.  I have $5.\n2.  I buy \"Credit Card\" for $1. I am at $4.\n3.  I buy \"Star\" for $3. I am at $1.\n4.  I buy \"Mega Celestial Pack\" for $8. I am at $-7 (debt is now).\n\nRight. Buying the \"Credit Card\" for $1 is the critical first step. It gives me breathing room. Let's make this happen. I will do this by buying it first. Then the \"Star\". Then, the \"Mega Celestial Pack\".\n\nThe action is: `buy_card`, and position is `[1]`\n\nFinal check:\n\nCurrent Money: $5.\nCredit Card Cost: $1.\nOwned Jokers: 4. Max Jokers: 6.\nSpace is available.\n\nAction: `buy_card`, positions: `[1]`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
