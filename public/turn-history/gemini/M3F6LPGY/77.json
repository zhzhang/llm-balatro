{"reasoning":"**The Poker Strategy Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. We're in Ante 4, Small Blind, and the goal is 5,000 chips. Right now, I'm at 1,620, and I have three hands left. I'm leveraging the \"Ride the Bus\" Joker, which is currently at +25 Mult and scales with non-face cards. The \"Acrobat\" Joker offers a juicy x3 Mult on the final hand, but only *that* hand. The \"Greedy Joker\" adds +3 Mult for scored Diamonds, and I have the Ace of Diamonds in my hand. Crucially, I'm in debt, so winning this round is key.\n\nMy initial thought is to maximize Ride the Bus. My hand consists of: 4S, 3H, 2H, JC, 8C, 4C, AD, JD. Playing a Face card resets Ride the Bus, so I *must* avoid Jacks. If I play the Ace of Diamonds (AD) right now, it's a High Card. The base chips is 56 (45 base plus 11 from the Ace), and with Greedy Joker and Ride the Bus, my Mult is 33 (5 base + 3 Greedy + 25 Ride the Bus). This gets me ~1848 chips, bringing my total to 3,468. If I play another card worth ~1,600, I'll pass 5,000 and the round will end. Acrobat would never trigger.\n\nI have 4 discards, which I'll use to filter out face cards. With three hands left, I want to optimize Ride the Bus by playing two hands with non-face cards before unleashing Acrobat on the third, *final* hand. I have to make sure to reach 5,000 chips.\n\nThe Star converts up to 3 cards to Diamonds. If I use it on non-Diamonds, Greedy Joker (+3) triggers more. However, for a High Card, only the scored card matters. It doesn't help if I score the non-face cards. I'm playing High Card anyway, I'll save \"The Star\" for later.\n\nThe order of jokers matters. Greedy Joker is an \"On Scored\" Joker (Step 3). Ride the Bus and Acrobat are \"Independent\" Jokers (Step 5). Since Acrobat is x Mult and Ride the Bus is + Mult, Ride the Bus *must* be to the left of Acrobat. Current Joker Order: 1: Ride the Bus, 2: Acrobat. This is correct.\n\nNow, let's crunch the numbers. I play the Ace of Diamonds. This yields (45 + 11) * (5 + 3 + 25) = 1848 chips. Ride the Bus goes to +26. I'm now at 3,468. If I play an 8C (which has a chip value of 8), I get (45 + 8) * (5 + 26) = ~1643 chips, getting me to a total of 5111. I win and Ride the Bus scales, but Acrobat won't trigger. I want scaling more.\n\nWait, Midas Mask's secondary description: \"$3 if this card is held in hand at end of round +1 Joker slot\".\n\nOkay, the last turn was a High Card, yielding 1,620 chips. Yes, that's banked. The Ride the Bus at 25 Mult is correct, scaling is working! Greedy Joker \"+3 Mult when scored\". Yes.\n\nI need to execute. I'll play the Ace of Diamonds, as a High Card.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [7]"}
