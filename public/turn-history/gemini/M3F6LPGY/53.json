{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nAlright, let's see where we are. Round 6, Ante 3. We just beat the Small Blind, but I'm strapped for cash with only $2. The shop's a no-go – everything's priced at $4 or more, and a reroll is out of the question at $5. Looks like I'm stuck with what I've got.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup though: Ride the Bus (+18 Mult), Acrobat (X3 Mult on final hand), Midas Mask (negative, and provides $3), and now, thanks to the Judgement card, the Greedy Joker (+3 Mult for Diamonds). Midas Mask is a bit of a wildcard since it offers a bonus slot, but it's not currently taking up a standard spot. My total Joker slots used are 4/6.\n\nMy initial thought was to rearrange the Jokers.  I've got to make sure the scoring order is optimized: +Mult before xMult.  I'm thinking: 1. Ride the Bus, 2. Greedy Joker, 3. Acrobat, 4. Midas Mask. After some consideration, I decided that the current order of the cards isn't strictly wrong.\n\nSince I can't buy anything, rearranging is unnecessary. It's time to move to the next blind.\n\nLet's double-check the scoring logic, just to be thorough. The scoring order looks correct: Card effects (Greedy Joker) then +Mult (Ride the Bus) then xMult (Acrobat).\n\nSince I have no other options, let's select the next round. *Wait*, is rearranging even necessary *right now*? I can do it at any point. No, since I can't buy anything, moving to the next round is the most logical choice.\n\nI've got to ensure the Jokers are in the best possible positions. Greedy Joker adds +3 Mult for Diamonds. So, if I play a Diamond card (not a face card) as High Card: Mult = 24. Final hand: 24 * 3 = 72. I don't see any other logical action so let's move forward.\n\nI'm ready. The ideal action is `round_select`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, let's look at my money: $2. Shop cards: Can't afford them. Boosters: Can't afford them. Vouchers: Can't afford them. No consumables. I have four Jokers, with a max of six.\n\nI'm not going to sell Midas Mask for $6 to buy a card. The potential negative on face cards is offset by $3 at the end of the round. It's too valuable.\n\nLooking at the Joker order: Ride the Bus, Acrobat, Midas Mask, Greedy Joker. It's not worth making any changes. The final Mult will be *Ride the Bus* (18), and then the Mult of *Acrobat* (X3).\n\nThe scoring is:\n-Card scores (Greedy Joker +3).\n-Independent Jokers: *RTB* (+18), *Acrobat* (X3)\n\nAgain, it's correct.\n\nAction: `round_select`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\nOkay, let's move to the Blind Select screen.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\nAll other actions are impossible:\n\n- Can't buy.\n- Can't reroll.\n- Can't use.\n- Can rearrange, but it does not make a difference.\n- Can't sell (don't want to).\n\nThe order is already correct (Additive + before Multiplicative x).\n\nSince the task is to select an action:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\nOkay, ready.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\nI'm happy with this choice. Now, let's crush the Big Blind.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
