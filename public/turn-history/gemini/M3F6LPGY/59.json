{"reasoning":"**My Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's see what we have here. I'm sitting on $4 after that last big blind, and my joker lineup is interesting. \"Ride the Bus\" is my primary carry, aiming for a high mult by avoiding face cards. Then I've got \"Acrobat\" for the final hand mult, \"Midas Mask\" (the negative one, which is a bit of a liability if I get unlucky with face cards), and \"Greedy Joker\" for those sweet diamond multipliers.\n\nLooking at the shop, I'm presented with some interesting choices: \"Sly Joker\" (pair boost), \"Zany Joker\" (3 of a kind mult), a \"Celestial Pack,\" and the option to reroll, which is out of the question since I only have $4 and it costs $5.\n\nI need to analyze my hand. My build is leaning pretty hard into that \"Ride the Bus\" strategy and boosting a \"High Card\" hand (currently level 4). Both \"Sly Joker\" and \"Zany Joker\" are worth considering. The \"Sly Joker\" offers a nice chip boost if I get a pair, which is rare but good if it occurs. The \"Zany Joker\" offers 12 mult for 3 of a kind, but \"Ride the Bus\" is already doing well on the mult front. The \"Celestial Pack\" is intriguing because it can level up \"High Card\" even further (perhaps another Pluto!). I bought one last turn and got Pluto, which really helped. Buying a Celestial pack is generally a strong move for long-term scaling, as I've found.\n\nI have $4 exactly. Purchasing the \"Celestial Pack\" seems like the most strategic move in the long run. Building up a core hand like this, via the Celestial Pack, seems to be the best way to leverage my resources. The \"Sly Joker\" would leave me with $1. The \"Zany Joker\" would be nice, but \"Ride the Bus\" is already pulling weight with its mult.\n\nGiven the current setup, and especially the synergy with \"Ride the Bus,\" the \"Celestial Pack\" is the clear winner here. I'm going to buy the Celestial Pack. It's a risk, but it's a calculated one, given the potential payout down the line. It's time to build this High Card strategy!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
