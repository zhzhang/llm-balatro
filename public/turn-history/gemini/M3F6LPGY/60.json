{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Celestial Pack: Choosing the Optimal Planet**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Planet Pack (Celestial Pack) stage. The objective is clear: pick one of the three Planet cards – Jupiter, Neptune, or Uranus. Let's break this down. My Jokers are \"Ride the Bus\" (which is the core of this build), \"Acrobat\", \"Midas Mask\" (unfortunately), and \"Greedy Joker\". \"Ride the Bus\" is king here, giving me a +20 multiplier, which increases with each hand if I can dodge face cards. \"Greedy Joker\" offers a nice +3 multiplier specifically for Diamonds.\n\nLooking at my hand levels, *High Card* is my workhorse at Level 4, but annoyingly, it's not one of the available Planet cards in this pack. *Flush* is at Level 2, *Two Pair* at Level 1, and *Straight Flush* at Level 1. I need to think about which card best complements my existing Jokers and my focus on \"Ride the Bus\" and maximizing my \"High Card\" potential.\n\nThe options: Jupiter (Flush), Neptune (Straight Flush), and Uranus (Two Pair).\n\n*   *Flush* (Jupiter) is already Level 2. Flushes are pretty easy to get, and the \"Ride the Bus\" strategy of avoiding face cards works really well with it. Plus, \"Greedy Joker\" gives me that sweet Diamond synergy.\n*   *Straight Flush* (Neptune) is just too rare and unreliable. It's not a viable strategy.\n*   *Two Pair* (Uranus) is only Level 1. *Flush* at Level 2 is generally better, and more consistent, and I have a level in it already.\n\nConsidering everything, *Flush* feels like the clear winner. *High Card* isn't available, and while *Two Pair* is okay, *Flush* is a generally stronger and more consistent hand that synergizes with \"Greedy Joker\". Since \"Ride the Bus\" rewards avoiding face cards, Flush seems the way to go. Leveling *Flush* with Jupiter will increase the base value of a solid hand I can play often. So, I will **select** Jupiter.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
