{"reasoning":"**The Strategic Calculation**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Round 8, Ante 3/8, staring down the Boss blind with a -1 hand size. I need to make 1649 chips to clear this blind. I have two hands left, and four discards. My hand is: Jack(S), 6(S), Queen(C), 3(C), 8(D), 6(D), 4(D).\n\nI have the \"Ride the Bus\" Joker, which gives a hefty +22 Multiplier if I *don't* score with any face cards this round. The \"Acrobat\" Joker, X3 the final hand, is crucial, so this hand is Hand 2, and the *next* hand is the last. I also have \"Midas Mask,\" which makes Face Cards gold when scored. I *don't* want to score any Face Cards right now, so that's irrelevant. \"Greedy Joker\" is great – it adds +3 Multiplier to Diamond cards that are *scored*.\n\nMy goal is clear: Score a decent chunk of points *without* resetting \"Ride the Bus\", and set up a killer final hand for the Acrobat. I need to leave myself with a score of 402 or less for the final hand.\n\nLooking at my hand, I see a clear path: play the 8(D), 6(D), 4(D), 6(S), and 3(C) as a High Card (8 of Diamonds). This means no face cards will be played and scored. The 8 of Diamonds will be the Highest Card in this hand. \"Greedy Joker\" will kick in for the 8(D) and give a +3 multiplier. \"Ride the Bus\" will provide the other +22 Multiplier since I'm not using a face card.\n\nSo, let's break down the math. Base Chips are 35. The 8 of Diamonds adds +8 Chips, for a total of 43 chips. Base Multiplier is 4, \"Greedy Joker\" gives +3 for the diamond 8, and \"Ride the Bus\" gives +22, for a total Multiplier of 29. 43 chips times 29 multiplier equals 1247 chips. I've double checked that the Diamonds other than the High Card, (6D, 4D), won't be counted for \"Greedy Joker\".\n\nThis will leave me needing 402 chips to win, which I can absolutely achieve with the final Acrobat hand. Playing the High Card strategy this hand gives me a safe path to victory.\n\nI need to confirm the card positions:\n1: J(S)\n2: 6(S) -> Play\n3: Q(C)\n4: 3(C) -> Play\n5: 8(D) -> Play (Scores)\n6: 6(D) -> Play\n7: 4(D) -> Play\n\nThis seems correct, and I'll confirm that 43 times 29, is, in fact, 1247. Now let's play this.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,2,4]"}
