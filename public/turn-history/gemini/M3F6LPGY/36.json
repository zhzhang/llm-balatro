{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment and Action Plan**\n\nOkay, let's take stock of the situation. We're at Ante 2, Round 4, in the Shop phase. I've got $3. My Joker setup is Ride the Bus in slot 1 (a +10 Mult), Acrobat in slot 2 (x3 Mult on the last hand), and Midas Mask in slot 3 (which turns face cards to gold when scored and gives me $3 if held, plus an extra Joker slot. We have an Earth consumable in position 1 that levels up Full House. I can have a max of 6 Jokers (5 + 1 from the Midas Mask).\n\nLooking at the shop, the Vampire is tempting but is way out of reach at $12. The Standard Pack is $4, and a Clearance Sale Voucher costs $10, also too expensive.\n\nI can't afford anything currently. I have these possible actions:\n\n*   `use_consumable 1`: Use Earth to level up Full House.\n*   `sell_consumable 1`: Sell Earth for $1 (Total $4).\n*   `rearrange_jokers`: Change Joker order.\n*   `sell_joker`: Sell a Joker.\n*   `buy_card`, `buy_booster`, `buy_voucher`: All too expensive.\n*   `round_select`: Go to the next blind.\n*   `reroll_shop`: Costs $5 (Cannot afford).\n\nMy current priority is to maximize my scoring potential this early on.\n\nI have Earth (lvl 1), which increases Full House by +2 Mult and +25 chips. Selling it gets me to $4. The Standard Pack is not a good deal. There's a much bigger benefit to the Earth card, so I should use it now. The vampire is very far out of reach.\n\nI need to make sure my Jokers are ordered optimally. Ride the Bus should be to the left of Acrobat to maximize the multiplier. The current order, Ride the Bus (1), Acrobat (2), Midas Mask (3), is the correct order.\n\nThe best course of action is to use the Earth planet card to upgrade Full House.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.  Use Earth.\n2.  Go to the round selection.\n\nTherefore, I will action `use_consumable` with position `1`. I need to execute `use_consumable 1`. I need to check one more time: Earth permanently improves Full House. The Standard Pack has a low probability of an improvement at this point in the run. I have no reason to hesitate, and I should use Earth.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
