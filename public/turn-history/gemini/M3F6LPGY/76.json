{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Strategy: High Card with Ride the Bus Scaling**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm on round 9, with a small blind of 5,000 chips, and I'm currently down $-13. I have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining. I need to make some serious chips. The current hand is: 4 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds.\n\nMy Joker setup is: Ride the Bus (+24 Mult), Acrobat (x3 Mult on final hand), Midas Mask (-$3 if held at end of round + 1 Joker Slot), Greedy Joker (+3 Mult for Diamonds), and Credit Card (up to -$20).\n\nMy primary objective here is to scale *Ride the Bus*. It gains +1 Mult per non-scoring face card played per hand, which is crucial. Midas Mask is a little unclear on the description... it seems to be unique version that provides an extra Joker slot.\n\nMy initial thought is to discard the face cards (Jack of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds) to keep Ride the Bus scaling. I *could* also use \"The Star\" to create Diamonds for Greedy Joker, but I might want to save it for a better hand or to synergize with Greedy Joker later.\n\nNow, let's look at the basic plan. I'm going to aim for High Card, which at Level 5 is worth 45 chips and 5 Mult. Ride the Bus will give me a huge bonus. Based on this, I'm expecting roughly (45 + 9) * (5 + 24) = 1,566 chips, playing a single non-face card. If I play this kind of hand for the next three hands, I will have more than enough to win the round.\n\n*   I'll discard the face cards to maximize my odds of drawing non-face cards and Diamond.\n*   The final hand *must* utilize Acrobat for the x3 multiplier.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nAfter some more thought, I see the scaling potential. *Ride the Bus* gains Mult per hand *played*. So, to maximize it, I need to play as many scoring hands as possible without face cards. Since I have 4 hands and the 4 hands are sufficient to meet the goal, I'm set!\n\nLet's work out the math. If I play a non-face card and maintain the non-face hand (High Card) 3 times I will have (54 * 29) * 3 = 4698 and the ride the bus will scale to 27. On my fourth hand, it will increase to 28 for a final high-card score of ~1,566. And then with the Acrobat multiplier this total ~4,698.\n\nLet's put together the plan. I will play the 9 of Hearts as a High Card. Discard the face cards to keep getting better hands. I'm going to stick to a High Card for each round. On the final round, I'll still do a high card but with the Acrobat Joker.\n\n*   I can also keep \"The Star\" for a future hand.\n*   Since I can win, I need to check the Joker order.\n\nThe correct Joker order is: Ride the Bus, Greedy Joker, Acrobat. This is so that the Greedy Joker can also be multiplied by the Acrobat.\n\nSo, I'm going to play the 9 of Hearts (Position 2). This will get me my initial High Card of ~1,566 chips and start the scaling process. Then, I can focus on scaling Ride the Bus with high card and non-face cards!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2]"}
