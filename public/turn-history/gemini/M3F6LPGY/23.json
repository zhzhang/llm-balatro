{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and My Options**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the SHOP phase of Ante 2, Round 3, with a measly $1. My strategy hinges on \"Ride the Bus,\" so keeping face cards out of the picture is paramount. I've got a couple of Jokers – Ride the Bus (+8 Mult, resets on face cards) and Acrobat (X3 on final hand) – and a couple of consumables: The Magician (Lucky cards) and Strength (+1 rank).\n\nThe shop's offerings are underwhelming given my budget: Mars ($3, Planet), To Do List ($4, Joker), a Mega Standard Pack ($8, Booster), and a Clearance Sale ($10, Voucher).\n\nNow, let's break down these consumables. The Magician could be useful, as turning non-face cards into Lucky cards could generate some mult without risking face cards. Strength, however, is intriguing because I could manipulate face cards into non-face cards. J->Q, Q->K, K->A – hold on... In Balatro, Aces aren't face cards! That's perfect for \"Ride the Bus.\"\n\nI can't afford anything in the shop right now. Selling the consumables would net me $2 more ($1 each). That would put me at $3. It's enough to buy Mars, but the Mars effect is useless for my build.\n\nBut can I even *use* the consumables? Ah, no. The `use_consumable` command needs a hand visible, and I'm not in a hand-visible state right now. I was in a hand-visible state during the Tarot Pack step, but not now. The `use_consumable` command needs targets from the hand. Since I’m in the SHOP phase and not in a pack step, I can’t use them.\n\nSo, I have $1 and can't buy or use anything. Selling the consumables won't make a meaningful difference given the shop's offerings. Mars isn't useful to my build.\n\nGiven all this, the best course of action is clear: I need to exit the shop and move onto the next blind to earn some more money. There's nothing more I can do here.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
