I'm down -$14, facing \\\"The Arm\\\" boss blind which reduces hand levels, and I *need* 10,000 chips. I have four hands and zero discards. The hand I've drawn is: Ace of Spades, 10 of Spades, 3 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, King of Clubs, two 10 of Clubs, and a 7 of Diamonds. I've got a few useful Jokers: \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" (great for Clubs but I need to avoid face cards), \\\"Onyx Agate\\\" (bonus for Clubs), \\\"Acrobat\\\" (final hand multiplier), \\\"Midas Mask\\\" (negative face card effect, avoid!) \\\"Credit Card\\\" (gives me some breathing room on debt), and \\\"Sixth Sense\\\". Ugh, I was *really* hoping to get that Sixth Sense bonus but I don't have a 6 *and* I have no discards left. It is impossible to trigger this round.\\n\\nMy immediate focus is maximizing my chip generation with what I've got. I need to get as many chips as I can, as quickly as possible, to win. I need to keep \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" active, so the King of Clubs *cannot* be played, because it resets the multiplier. And I need to preserve my Club cards as much as possible, because \\\"Onyx Agate\\\" loves them.\\n\\nI've calculated the best hand to play: a High Card, using either the Ace or 10 of Clubs. The *ideal* scenario is to trigger the full \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" (+32) and \\\"Onyx Agate\\\" (+7), and then the level reduction from \\\"The Arm\\\". The plan is to play the Ace of Clubs as the first hand, then the 10 of Clubs in the following hands.\\n\\nI've considered other strategies, like forming a Pair to gain more Multiplier. But right now, the High Card yields more points. I need to cycle cards to find some more clubs and hopefully finish the round by holding the 10 of Clubs (Pos 7) to gain a Planet Card effect.\\n\\nI'm ready. The first play will be the Ace of Clubs. While I'm at it, I can also cycle the \\\"junk\\\" cards, to get another club in hand for a future round. Okay, let's play the Ace of Clubs! Let's get this done.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 4 3 8 high card 2464\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 100]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

I'm gunning for that sweet 10,000 chip prize, currently sitting on a meager 2,024. Three hands left, and a credit card debt looming at -$14. The \\\"Arm\\\" is breathing down my neck, ready to downgrade any hand I play. My brain is working at full throttle to maximize these final few hands.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand this boss mechanic. The \\\"Arm\\\" specifically reduces the level of the *played* hand. This means if I play High Card and score, it becomes Level 3 after I score. So, a level 4 High Card goes to 3, and a level 3 High Card goes to 2, and a level 2 High Card goes to 1. This is crucial for planning.\\n\\nLet's break down the cards: I'm holding a hand with two 10s of Clubs, King of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, and an Ace of Spades. The \\\"Ride the Bus\\\" joker is a gold mine, giving me +33 mult. Onyx Agate could give +7 mult if I play a club. Acrobat triggers a x3 mult on the last hand, and the \\\"Planet\\\" effect on the 10 of Clubs on the final hand. I need to make sure I get that effect.\\n\\nThe crucial decisions are beginning to emerge:\\n\\n**Hand 2 (Next Hand):**\\n* Play 10 of Clubs.\\n*  *My main priority is the Planet effect on the 10 of Clubs (Pos 7) for the last hand. I need to get the Onyx Agate working for me.*\\n*   Level: High Card is Level 4\\n*   Scoring Card: 10 of Clubs (Pos 6)\\n*   Play 6 (10C), 3 (6S), 4 (7H)\\n*   This is High Card (10 of Clubs).\\n*  (35 (Level 4->3) + 10) * (3 (Level 3) + 34 (Ride the Bus) + 7 (Onyx Agate)) =  45 * 44 = 1,980.\\n\\n**Hand 3:**\\n* Level 3 High Card.\\n* Scoring Card: 7 of Clubs\\n* Play: 7 of Clubs (Pos 8), 10 of Spades (Pos 2), 6 of Spades (Pos 3)\\n*   Level: High Card is Level 3\\n*   Scoring Card: 7 of Clubs\\n*   Play 8 (7C), 3 (6S), 2 (10S).\\n*  (25 (Level 3->2) + 7) * (3 (Level 2) + 35 (Ride the Bus) + 7 (Onyx Agate)) =  32 * 45 = 1,440.\\n\\n**Hand 4 (Final Hand):**\\n* Level 2 High Card.\\n* Scoring Card: 10 of Clubs.\\n* The Planet effect on the 10 of Clubs!\\n* Play: 10 of Clubs (Pos 7), 6 of Spades (Pos 3), 7 of Hearts (Pos 4)\\n*   Level: High Card is Level 2\\n*   Scoring Card: 10 of Clubs.\\n*   Play 7 (10C), 3 (6S), 4 (7H)\\n*  (25 (Level 2->1) + 10) * (3 (Level 1) + 36 (Ride the Bus) + 7 (Onyx Agate) * 3 (Acrobat)) =  35 * 135 = 4,725\\n\\nLet's do the math: 2024 (current) + 1980 + 1440 + 4725 = 10,169.\\n*I made it!*\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 3 4 6 high card 1980\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 101]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

Round 11, the dreaded \\\"The Arm\\\" boss blind is upon us, and I'm down to the wire. My goal is a cool 10,000 chips, and I'm currently sitting at 3,564, with a measly two hands left. The pressure is on! And I'm in the hole with -$14.\\n\\nFirst, I need to take stock. I've got my Ride the Bus joker at a solid +34 mult, Onyx Agate is giving me +7 for Clubs, and Acrobat is lurking, ready to triple my mult on the final hand. Oh, and of course, Midas Mask, making face cards Gold, but I'm trying to avoid them.  I am hoping to use Sixth Sense and the Credit Card if needed.\\n\\nThe key is this hand: Ace of Spades, 10 of Spades, 3 of Spades, King of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, and 6 of Diamonds. The Arm is going to drop my hand level. This is key to my strategy.\\n\\nI have two hands to make this happen, meaning my goal is to get as high a chip score as possible without losing the advantage.\\n\\nMy initial thought was to play the 7 of Clubs in the next hand, to get the most chips, keeping my 10 of Clubs for the final hand to trigger the planet. But wait, I've got to play the numbers. What if the calculations are all wrong? I need to get as many chips as possible from the penultimate hand.\\n\\nI need 6,436 chips. If I can play the 7 of Clubs next, I can get 1,408. But, I am still 5,028 chips short! \\n\\nI need to maximize this first hand. Then the final.\\n\\nI need to evaluate all the hands... High Card, Flush, Pair, etc. And, oh, the cards left in the deck! What do I need to pull? I've got a lot of calculations to make, a lot of what-ifs to analyze.\\n\\nAh-ha! A Pair of 10s... If I play the 10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs, I score 1,980. That's better! If I score 1,980 on the penultimate hand, plus the total for the current 3,564, I need at least 4,456 more for the win.  I need to score high in the final hand.\\n\\nAlso, Ride the Bus will give me another +1 mult. So the final hand will be higher.\\n\\nThen, there's the Acrobat multiplier. That adds even more to the final score.\\n\\nAnd finally, to keep Onyx Agate activated, I need to make sure I score the Club card. So, if I play a Pair, and score a Club card, then the Onyx Agate is activated. I can't let it pass. I have to count it in.\\n\\nI have to carefully evaluate the final hand. I need to make sure I score a Club.\\n\\nSo, here's the plan. I will play the 10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs for a Pair of 10s in the penultimate hand (1,980 chips). I must play a Club card (10 of Clubs), in that hand to get the Onyx Agate. Then, I need to draw some good cards to get the highest score possible in the final hand.\\n\\nIn the penultimate hand, I must not use the Queen or King. Those ruin my strategy. I will play the two 10s, with the other cards, and pray for high cards!\\n\\nI've got this. I think. Okay, let's do this!\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 2 5 1 3 8 pair 1980\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ride the Bus.

  "reasoning": "**Analysis Paralysis: The Final Hand**\n\nOkay, here we are. Final hand, 10,000 chip target, and a tight situation. I'm currently at 4,884, so I need at least 5,116 more. Let's see... I've got a decent setup with **Ride the Bus**, **Onyx Agate**, and **Acrobat** Jokers in play.  That Acrobat is going to be crucial with its x3 multiplier at the end of the round. Plus, the negative **Midas Mask** is in play, so I need to avoid face cards. And the Arm is going to downgrade whatever hand I play.\n\nLet's quickly review the hand: I have a King and Queen in each suit, and some other cards too. Okay, so I am going to avoid face cards since that will reset Ride the Bus.\n\n*   **Option A, High Card (7 of Clubs):** I could play the 7 of Clubs, ensuring *Ride the Bus* and *Acrobat* trigger. The 7 of Clubs will score a base of 25 chips. Add the 7 and score 7 Onyx Agate is (25 + 7) * (3 + 35 + 7) * 3 = 4,320. Not enough! I am still short!\n\n*   **Option B, High Card (Ace of Hearts):** I could play the Ace of Hearts, but it does not trigger the Onyx Agate. I need to be 36 * (3 + 35) * 3 = 4,104, short.\n\n    Okay, so I have to try something else here, since I'm short and the obvious options don't look great. \n*   **Option C, Two Pair:** I have two Kings, two Queens, and two 7s.\n    Two Pair with 7s: (7s, 7c, Kings) = 54 \\* 48 = 2,592 (Not enough)\n    \n*   **Option D: High Card with Lucky.**\nI could try for Lucky, and 1/5 chance for +20 Mult, and Ace would get me 36 * 58 * 3 = 6,264.\n\nOkay, I need to look at what will make the most chips.\nLet me go back and re-evaluate the scoring. Ok, since 7 of Clubs is in play I can get the highest chip potential. Ok, back to the calculations. It looks like... wait, is there an extra multiplier being applied?\nNo, it's correct. \nOk, let me look at all the Jokers again, ok. Ride the Bus is +35, Onyx Agate +7 for Clubs, Acrobat x3. Midas Mask is negative, so irrelevant.\n\nOk, now, I need to get as high as possible.\nI am very close.\nOk, if I have to, I will play the High Card Ace (if I can't reach the target with the 7 of Clubs). And hope for that lucky trigger.\n6,264 could reach it! It is the highest probability.\n\n\n"
