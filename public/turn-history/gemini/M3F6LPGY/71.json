{"reasoning":"**Choosing the Second Planet for My Mega Celestial Pack**\n\nOkay, here we are, Round 8, with an ante of 4/8. I've already snagged Pluto, and now it's time to choose the second Planet from this Mega Celestial Pack. The pack rules are clear: I can pick two Planets immediately. I'm focusing on my High Card strategy, currently at Level 5, aiming to scale Ride the Bus. My Joker setup is looking good: Ride the Bus, Acrobat (x3 Mult on final hand), Midas Mask (negative, turning face cards Gold), Greedy Joker (+3 Mult on Diamonds), and Credit Card (debt limit).\n\nThe pack gives me the following choices: Mercury (Pair), Uranus (Two Pair), Venus (Three of a Kind), and Mars (Four of a Kind).\n\nConsidering my build, Mercury seems like the safest bet. It's the most likely accidental hand while focusing on High Card, and leveling up Pair is a solid backup plan if I stumble into playing a Pair instead of a High Card (though I should be aiming for the latter). Let me check the current hand levels: Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, and Four of a Kind are all at Level 1. I’ve played Pair 4 times and Three of a Kind once.\n\nTherefore, the obvious choice is to level up Pair, which is Mercury (position 1 in the pack). I know I need to use the `select` command and input the position in the pack. I've selected Pluto previously, so now I need to select Mercury (position 1) to level up my Pair.\n\nSo, `action`: \"select\", `positions`: [1]. Mercury, here I come!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
