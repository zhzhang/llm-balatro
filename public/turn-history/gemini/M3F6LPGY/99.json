{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Labyrinth of Luck and Strategy**\n\nAlright, here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 11. I'm gunning for that sweet 10,000 chip prize, currently sitting on a meager 2,024. Three hands left, and a credit card debt looming at -$14. The \"Arm\" is breathing down my neck, ready to downgrade any hand I play. My brain is working at full throttle to maximize these final few hands.\n\nFirst, I need to understand this boss mechanic. The \"Arm\" specifically reduces the level of the *played* hand. This means if I play High Card and score, it becomes Level 3 after I score. So, a level 4 High Card goes to 3, and a level 3 High Card goes to 2, and a level 2 High Card goes to 1. This is crucial for planning.\n\nLet's break down the cards: I'm holding a hand with two 10s of Clubs, King of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, and an Ace of Spades. The \"Ride the Bus\" joker is a gold mine, giving me +33 mult. Onyx Agate could give +7 mult if I play a club. Acrobat triggers a x3 mult on the last hand, and the \"Planet\" effect on the 10 of Clubs on the final hand. I need to make sure I get that effect.\n\nThe crucial decisions are beginning to emerge:\n\n**Hand 2 (Next Hand):**\n* Play 10 of Clubs.\n*  *My main priority is the Planet effect on the 10 of Clubs (Pos 7) for the last hand. I need to get the Onyx Agate working for me.*\n*   Level: High Card is Level 4\n*   Scoring Card: 10 of Clubs (Pos 6)\n*   Play 6 (10C), 3 (6S), 4 (7H)\n*   This is High Card (10 of Clubs).\n*  (35 (Level 4->3) + 10) * (3 (Level 3) + 34 (Ride the Bus) + 7 (Onyx Agate)) =  45 * 44 = 1,980.\n\n**Hand 3:**\n* Level 3 High Card.\n* Scoring Card: 7 of Clubs\n* Play: 7 of Clubs (Pos 8), 10 of Spades (Pos 2), 6 of Spades (Pos 3)\n*   Level: High Card is Level 3\n*   Scoring Card: 7 of Clubs\n*   Play 8 (7C), 3 (6S), 2 (10S).\n*  (25 (Level 3->2) + 7) * (3 (Level 2) + 35 (Ride the Bus) + 7 (Onyx Agate)) =  32 * 45 = 1,440.\n\n**Hand 4 (Final Hand):**\n* Level 2 High Card.\n* Scoring Card: 10 of Clubs.\n* The Planet effect on the 10 of Clubs!\n* Play: 10 of Clubs (Pos 7), 6 of Spades (Pos 3), 7 of Hearts (Pos 4)\n*   Level: High Card is Level 2\n*   Scoring Card: 10 of Clubs.\n*   Play 7 (10C), 3 (6S), 4 (7H)\n*  (25 (Level 2->1) + 10) * (3 (Level 1) + 36 (Ride the Bus) + 7 (Onyx Agate) * 3 (Acrobat)) =  35 * 135 = 4,725\n\nLet's do the math: 2024 (current) + 1980 + 1440 + 4725 = 10,169.\n*I made it!*\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,6]"}
