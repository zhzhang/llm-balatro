{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State: Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop, first round, with a measly $2. The goal is to get to the next blind. Let's see, I've got \"Ride the Bus\" as my Joker, which I *need* to start scaling since it’s currently at +0 multiplier. It scales up with non-face cards – that's crucial. I have nothing else: no consumables, no vouchers. My \"Flush\" hand is level 2, which gives me a 50 chip base with a 6 multiplier.\n\nLooking at the shop, there's nothing I can afford. \"Photograph\" is $5 and conflicts with my Joker, and the \"Saturn\" is also $3. I can't even get a reroll at $5 or the Director's cut at $10. I have to select round_select.\n\nThe \"Ride the Bus\" needs those low cards. The Big Blind is 450 chips. A Flush at level 2, with that 6x multiplier... let's say I get a flush of low cards. That’s probably around 80 chips (50 base + cards) * 6 multiplier, or about 480 chips. That should get me through the Big Blind in one or two hands, all while building up \"Ride the Bus.\" Time to move forward - I'll execute the `round_select` command.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
