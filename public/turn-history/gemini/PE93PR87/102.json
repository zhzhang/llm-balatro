{"reasoning":"**Decision Time in Balatro**\n\nAlright, the game wants me to pick a Planet card from the Jumbo Celestial Pack. I'm in Ante 4/8, Round 10, and need 5000 chips to clear the ante. I've got $33 right now.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup: Green Joker (Holo), Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome), and Constellation (Negative, with the \"+1 Joker slot\" thing going on, but it is working).\n\nHere are the Planets: Venus levels up Three of a Kind, Neptune is Straight Flush, Pluto is High Card, Uranus is Two Pair, and Saturn is Straight.\n\nI'm currently playing a mix of Three of a Kind, Full Houses, and some Two Pairs (because of Spare Trousers).\n\nRight now, the priority is to consider how my Planets will interact with my deck. Venus (Three of a Kind, Level 4) is appealing because it is a hand I regularly use and enjoy. Plus, my current hand types will scale my Spare Trousers joker. Leveling it up will make it very strong.\n\nI'm thinking about how the scoring works. The prompt says a Full House contains a Two Pair for Joker effects, and that seems to hold up. This means that even if the base score is only calculated for the \"highest\" hand, it does scale the jokers in my deck.\n\nI'm leaning towards Venus for Three of a Kind. Three of a Kind is level 4, while Straight is Level 2. So Venus (Three of a Kind) seems the best choice because Three of a Kind is frequently used. However, I should check my actual hand types: I've played Three of a Kind twice, Pairs twice, Full Houses four times, and Two Pairs twice. Thus, Venus seems like the best choice.\n\nI'll go with Venus. It's +2 Mult (good for scaling) and +20 chips. I want to keep Three of a Kind strong.\n\nThe only remaining choice is if there are other considerations:\n1.  **Joker Order:** It seems fine.\n2.  **Shop:** The step is Planet Pack.\n\nI'm going with Venus, which is position 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
