{"reasoning":"**Pre-Boss Blind Decision: The Pillar**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 7, Round 16, with $29 in the bank. I've got a solid Joker setup: Green Joker (Holo, +22 mult), Spare Trousers (+16 mult), Certificate (for seal generation), Luchador (Polychrome, X1.5 mult - boss defense), Constellation (Negative, X2.9 mult scaling with planets), and Blue Joker (+122 chips). I also have a The Lovers consumable and a few vouchers – Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Grabber, and Hieroglyph.\n\nThe shop is offering Popcorn ($5, +20 mult decaying) and Crazy Joker ($4, +12 mult for Straights), but honestly, neither are compelling. I'm at a full Joker slot capacity. Popcorn is temporary and I have better mult already, and Crazy Joker is niche and weaker than what I've got. The real goal here is to maximize my score to beat this Ante 7 boss, \"The Pillar,\" and ideally set myself up for Ante 8. My core engine is built around scaling Constellation using Planet cards.\n\nMy immediate constraint is that I've only got $29 and I'm nearing the boss. I'm getting $5 interest currently. Rerolling ($7) is tempting for a chance at a planet card, but it's risky. That leaves me with $22, which is below the interest cap, so the risk outweighs the reward. I've got to make a choice.\n\nSo, I have three options: reroll, buy popcorn, or advance to the round. Rerolling again would be risky at $22. Buying Popcorn is useless, because the full Joker slots. Advancing is the obvious choice. I have a very strong hand.\n\nConsidering the \"Pillar\" boss, which debuffs previously played cards, I need to be careful with hand selection. I'm fairly confident in my current setup: Blue Joker (chips), Green Joker (mult), Spare Trousers (mult), Luchador (boss defense), and Constellation (scaling).\n\nHere's my rough score estimate: a basic Two Pair Level 2 would give me around 40 chips and 3 mult. Add Blue Joker's +122 chips, and that's roughly 162 chips per hand. With Green Joker and Spare Trousers I'm looking at +38 mult, plus a base mult of 3. Luchador adds X1.5 and Constellation adds X2.9. That brings my total mult to around 178. Multiply chips by mult (162 * 178) is roughly 28,836 chips per hand. With 6 hands in total (Grabber + Hieroglyph -1), I'm looking at about 168k chips which should be more than enough to beat the Ante 7 boss comfortably.\n\nI've already rerolled twice, so further spending now would be detrimental. There's nothing in the shop that helps my core strategy. I'll get $5 interest and potentially win more money by advancing.\n\nI'll choose the round. And... now let's double check Joker order: it doesn't matter too much, but let's make sure +mult is first before Xmult, and that the Blue Joker, with the chips is first. Yes, that's what I have. Alright, let's proceed to the round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
