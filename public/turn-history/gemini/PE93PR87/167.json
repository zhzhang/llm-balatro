{"reasoning":"**My Round 15 Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Blind Select, getting ready to face The Mark. My ante is 6, and I need to hit 40,000 chips. Right now, I have $43. The Boss Blind effect is a problem – all face cards are dealt face down – but I have the `Luchador` joker, which can disable it.\n\nMy hand is pretty strong. I've got a Holo Green Joker (+11 Mult), Spare Trousers (+14 Mult), a Certificate, the `Luchador` (Polychrome x1.5 Mult), Constellation (Negative, x2.8 Mult), and a Blue Joker (+122 Chips). I also have 'The Lovers' consumable, which I'll hold for now.\n\nThe *immediate* decision is: do I sell `Luchador` to remove the blind, or play the round with the blind active?\n\nLet's do some quick math. I'm expecting to make a Three of a Kind. The Blue Joker gets me +122 Chips, and the Green Joker and Spare Trousers offer +25 to my multiplier. Then the `Luchador` and Constellation give me x4.2 on top of that. A Three of a Kind at Level 9 offers 190 Chips and 19 Mult. So, if I can hit a Three of a Kind, I'm looking at roughly (190 + 122) * (19 + 25) * 4.2, which is about 62,000 chips – easily over the 40,000 target.\n\nThe `Luchador`'s Polychrome multiplier of x1.5 is a bonus I don't want to toss if I can avoid it. Since I can disable the Boss Blind *during* the round if I need to, there's no harm in starting with the blind active. My joker order is already optimized for this. +chips on the left, then additive mults, then the multiplicative jokers. I should be able to make a play either way.\n\nThe command is straightforward: `play_round`. I am set!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
