{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis: Balatro - Round 17**\n\nOkay, here we are, Round 17, with $40 in the bank, aiming for those juicy Big Blind (52.5k) and Boss (70k) scores. The shop is open, and I've got some decisions to make. Let's start with my current setup: Green Joker (+23 Mult), Spare Trousers (+18 Mult), Certificate (card gen), Luchador (x1.5 Mult, with polychrome and boss disable), Constellation (x3.0 Mult), and Blue Joker (+124 Chips).\n\nNow, the joker order... I've already optimized the additive and multiplicative joker order. Chips are calculated first. Then, additive multipliers are handled left-to-right, followed by multiplicative jokers, also handled left-to-right. Putting the multiplicative jokers (Luchador, Constellation) after the additive ones is absolutely the way to go here. I've re-confirmed this, it's critical.\n\nThe shop itself isn't *amazing* this round. The Rough Gem, offering a bonus for diamonds, is a bit of a dud. We're not in dire need of that kind of support. My real focus is finding Planets to scale my Constellation. So let's look at the boosters: Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6) and the regular Arcana Pack ($4). Arcana packs can give me a \"High Priestess\" (planets) or cards that let me manipulate the deck, which would be ideal.\n\nWith $40, I'm definitely going for the Jumbo Arcana Pack. It's the higher-value buy. I'm going to *buy_booster 2*. Then I'll re-evaluate. I should also consider a reroll for more Planets or helpful Tarots.\n\nAfter that, let's look at what else I can do: the card order is already optimized, so I don't need to *rearrange_jokers*. I have \"The Lovers\" consumable, but it's best to save that for the round to boost a specific card. I won't buy that Rough Gem and I already picked the best booster. The Jumbo Arcana Pack gives me the best chance to find something impactful like the \"High Priestess\" or other boosts.\n\nLet's do it! I'm going for the Jumbo Arcana Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
