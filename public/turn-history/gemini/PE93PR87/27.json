{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Plan of Action**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We're in Ante 2, Round 4, facing \"The Pillar\" boss blind. I need 1600 chips and have zero, but I've got 4 hands left. \"The Pillar\" is debuffing cards I used previously this Ante, but that's what I need to navigate. I've got a strong hand, with Aces, Kings, a Queen, and some other cards, all offering chip value. My inventory is looking solid, with Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador (Polychrome), Constellation, and a Justice card, which is huge.\n\nThe previous hand was a Two Pair, and that's the key: the Boss blind will debuff some of the cards I used last round. Based on previous behavior, it's likely Aces or Kings. I've got Aces and Kings in my hand, so I need to play smart. I need to be *sure* to use the Justice Card on a card I'm 100% *certain* wasn't played in that last hand.\n\nI'm thinking: Use Justice. This is going to be my linchpin play! I want to avoid debuffing the X2 multiplier, so I'm using the Justice card on the Ace of Diamonds, which was *just* drawn this turn. That's a safe bet; it wasn't in the Small Blind hand. I then need to discard some cards to activate Mystic Summit, giving me a +15 multiplier! \n\nThen, I'll play the highest-scoring hand. If I don't discard the cards, I *should* have enough chips to win.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.  Use Justice on the Ace of Diamonds (position 8).\n2.  Discard cards ( QS, 5H, 10C, 9C ) to activate the Mystic Summit (0 discards).\n3.  Play a high-scoring hand (likely Aces and Kings) for maximum chip generation.\n\nHere's the JSON for the action: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 8]}`. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,8]"}
