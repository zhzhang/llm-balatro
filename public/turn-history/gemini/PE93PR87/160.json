{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase, Ante 6, Round 15. I've got $62, and my main objective is to keep pushing towards beating those boss blinds. I'm getting close to the end of Ante 6, so I need to optimize this shop. My current hand is:\n\n*   **Green Joker (Holo):** +11 Mult, +10 Holo Mult, for a total of +21 mult.\n*   **Spare Trousers:** +14 Mult, scales on Two Pair.\n*   **Certificate:** Adds a sealed card every round.\n*   **Luchador (Polychrome):** x1.5 Mult, can disable Boss Blind.\n*   **Constellation (Negative):** x2.6 Mult, which is my primary scaling engine, increasing +0.1 per Planet card used.\n*   **Blue Joker:** +122 Chips.\n\nI also have *The Lovers* consumable (Wild card) and three vouchers: Tarot Merchant, Grabber, and Hieroglyph.\n\nLooking at the Shop, I see:\n\n*   A *Business Card* for $4.\n*   Two *Celestial Packs* for $4 each.\n*   And *Wasteful* for $10.\n\nGiven my setup, especially *Constellation*, Planets are the key to scaling my multiplier. I just used Venus and am in a good position.\n\nMy immediate focus is those Celestial Packs, as they’ll directly boost *Constellation*. I can afford both, so that's the obvious first move:\n\n1.  **Buy the first Celestial Pack.**\n2.  **Buy the second Celestial Pack.**\n\nAfter that, I'll assess the remaining options. *Business Card* is likely not worth it because I have no open joker slots. *Wasteful* is also not a high priority, given it increases discards, which is not good for Green Joker.\n\nAfter buying the booster packs, I'll need to consider my options. I should then decide whether to reroll the shop or round-select if I don't see anything promising. I need to make the next move, so I will now execute the first booster pack purchase.\n\n**Action: `buy_booster 1` (Celestial Pack).**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
