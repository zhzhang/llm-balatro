{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action for Small Blind Ante 1**\n\nOkay, the goal is 300 chips for the Small Blind. I have $4 right now, and I can play four hands. The cards I've got are: Ace of Spades (11), Jack of Spades (10), 3 of Spades (3), 3 of Hearts (3), Ace of Clubs (11), Jack of Clubs (10), 2 of Clubs (2), and Jack of Diamonds (10).\n\nLet's see the potential hands... I see three Jacks. Calculating for a Three of a Kind with Jacks, that's 180 chips, but I need 300. Then there's Two Pair, Jacks and Aces (124 chips), or Jacks and 3s (92 chips). Neither of these looks promising. But wait, a Full House is possible: Jacks over 3s.\n\nCalculating a Full House. Base is 40 chips times a multiplier of 4. Then, add the card values: 10 + 10 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 36. So, (40 + 36) * 4 = 304 chips. That's more than the 300 needed! This looks like the winning play.\n\nDouble-checking this... Yep, Full House: base is 40, multiplier is 4, and the card chip total is 36, for a total of 304.\n\nOkay, so I will play cards in positions 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, for the full house. That's a solid strategy.\n\nNow the JSON looks like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [2, 3, 4, 6, 8],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"full house\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 304\n}\n```\n\nOkay, the numbers are good, the positions are correct. Need to run a final check.\n\nAre there any other possible hands? Flushes aren't there. No straights either. No four of a kind either. Full house is the best.\n\nAction confirmed is \"play.\"\n\nNow, positions are [2, 3, 4, 6, 8].\n\nHand is \"full house\".\n\nChips are 304.\n\nLet's check the rules to see if it makes sense to go for a higher hand, or to discard cards to try to get more money after the round. But wait, since this round is only 300, getting the full house and hitting 304 seems optimal, because that also means I have 4 hands remaining at $1 each. Plus, the reward from the round.\n\nAt the end of the round, I'll have: $4 (current) + $3 (reward) + $3 (hands) = $10. And I'll get another $2 interest, to have $12 at the end. Best to hit the Full House and get the bonus money and hand reward.\n\nAction is \"play\", with positions [2, 3, 4, 6, 8] with a hand type of \"full house\". Estimated chips: 304. This is the optimal move.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,8]"}
