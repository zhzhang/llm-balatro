{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Final Stretch**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 8, Round 19. This is it, the final push for this run. I've got $22, and this shop is crucial. My core strategy hinges on Constellation, the x3.6 Mult Joker that scales with Planets. I have a solid Joker lineup already: the Holo Green Joker (Mult), Spare Trousers (Two Pair scaling), Certificate (adds cards and seals), Luchador (Polychrome and Boss disable), Blue Joker (chips), and of course, Constellation itself.\n\nI'm evaluating the shop options: Wily Joker is out; I'm happy with the flat chip generation from Blue Joker. The Star doesn't fit my scaling strategy. The Jumbo Pack has a small chance for a Planet but isn't ideal. The Hone Voucher is useless at this stage. That leaves the Reroll. Rerolling is the key to finding a Planet and really powering up Constellation. I need to get planets to buy, that's the only way to make it scale.\n\nJudgment is a consumable, but I don't want to sell any of my Jokers unless it would replace something weak, which isn't the case here. I don't really want to get rid of Certificate as it can create more cards and seals to help my Blue Joker.\n\nGiven I have a full Joker set, I'm already happy with the Luchador and Green Joker. Constellation is my main scaling engine at x3.6, with the aim to get this multiplier as high as possible.\n\nRight now, the reroll is the best play. It costs $6, and I still have enough money left over to potentially buy another Planet. I should always be keeping some money for the next shop as well. I'm sitting on enough money for the next shop if I need to.\n\nThe prompt says \"Game Step: SHOP.\" There are no Planets in the current shop. That seals it. I'm going for the Reroll. $6 for a shot at a Planet is worth it at this stage of the game.\n\nTherefore, the action is `reroll_shop`. I'm hoping for Planets to boost Constellation.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
