{"reasoning":"**Okay, here's the game plan, as I see it:** I'm in Ante 2, Round 3, facing a Spectral Pack after cleverly skipping the Big Blind with an Ethereal Tag. I've got $1, which is tight. My goal is to hit 1600 chips to beat the upcoming boss, \"The Pillar,\" which debuffs cards played in the *previous* Ante. I need to make the best of this Spectral Pack, looking at the cards and jokers available and strategizing for scaling.\n\nMy current jokers are a strong mix: Smiley Face (additive mult for face cards), Mystic Summit (additive mult for discards), Luchador (polychrome, disabled the boss when sold), Constellation (scaling multi, X1.1) and Certificate (a random sealed card each round - very useful!) The Luchador is a Polychrome, so that's a *lot* of Multiplier.\n\nThe Spectral Pack offers two enticing options: Talisman (Gold Seal for $3 when played) and Trance (Blue Seal for a Planet card if held at the end of the round). I'm leaning heavily towards **Trance**, which will *really* synergize with Constellation. Constellation gets X0.1 Mult for every Planet used, and I can generate one per round with Trance. Money is useful, but the long-term scaling of the X-Mult is better.\n\nNow, where to put that Blue Seal? I need a card I can safely keep in my hand. I'm thinking, since I have the Smiley Face and that's the only one of my Jokers that scales up face cards, I should consider *not* sealing a face card because I'll need to use those for scoring. The low-rank cards seem like good candidates. The 7 of Diamonds seems like a good choice to hold since it's not essential for a scoring hand and doesn't synergize with a joker *at the moment*. The Ace of Diamonds is better chip-wise, but I can't build face cards with it so it's less important to hold.\n\nWait, looking at the hand again: I'll choose Trance (choice 2) and apply it to the 7 of Diamonds (position 8). The previous round, I skipped the Big Blind. This means the Pillar debuffs whatever I played in the Small Blind. I need to get 1600 chips.\n\nThe command is `select 2 8`. I have to be sure about this.\n\nI'm checking that the Jokers are ordered for optimal scaling: Additive first, then multiplicative. Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, Constellation, and finally Certificate. Seems good.\n\nI need to confirm the Luchador's effect (Polychrome means X1.5). Since the Constellation is X1.1 and Luchador is X1.5, I can multiply these together to get X1.65.\n\nChecking again: I skipped the Big Blind last round. The previous blind was the Small Blind, where I played a Two Pair. Only these cards are debuffed. The Certificate card will be new, so it won't be debuffed.\n\nIf I take Trance, I get a Blue Seal and a Planet, which will scale the Constellation. Money is good, but the X-Multi Joker is better.\n\nOkay, let's verify the command again, it is: `select 2 8`. Positions are: Spectral Pack choice 2, to hand card position 8 which is the 7 of Diamonds.\n\nThere's no need to rearrange Jokers, sell any Jokers, or play other commands. It's a straight `select 2 8`.\n\nThe schema says `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1>`. Got it.\n\nDouble checking the hand, ensuring position 8 is the 7 of Diamonds. Yep, QS, QH, 4H, KC, 4C, AD, 9D, and finally 7D.\n\nOkay, I'm now certain: `select 2 8`.\n\nThe bonus from the Gold Seal is good ($3), but one planet, which scales the X-Mult joker, is better! I need the scaling more than the money right now.\n\nNo reason to put the Blue Seal on a face card because it wouldn't score, and Smiley Face needs the face cards to score in order to benefit from its mult bonus.\n\nTherefore, the final decision: **`select 2 8`**. Time to apply that Blue Seal to the 7 of Diamonds, set up Constellation scaling, and get ready to crush that boss!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,8]"}
