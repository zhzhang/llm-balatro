{"reasoning":"**My Shopping Strategy: Ante 6, Round 15**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop phase of Ante 6, with $65. I've got a decent hand, and my Jokers are shaping up nicely. I have six Jokers, with Constellation being the negative joker. Now, the main focus is maximizing Constellation's multiplier, along with the hand levels.\n\nMy current Jokers are solid: Green Joker providing a +21 mult, Spare Trousers with +14 scaling on Two Pair, a Certificate, Luchador for boss blind disruption, Constellation at x2.5, and a Blue Joker boosting my chips by 122.\n\nThe key here is Constellation, which scales with Planet cards. I can level my Three of a Kind with these. So, the first move is to prioritize getting that Venus card (in shop position 2) because it is a planet card, which increases Constellation from x2.5 to x2.6.\n\nI've already scanned the shop. I have Venus for $3 and Celestial Packs for $4 each. I have a Wasteful Voucher that I could get for $10, and a Business Card for $4, that gives a chance for face cards to be cheap. Buying Venus first, because of the immediate boost to Constellation is a good start. I can then use it, so let's start with `buy_and_use_consumable` to buy and immediately use Venus, at shop position 2. I'm already at the Joker limit, so Business Card doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm definitely going to buy the Celestial Packs too. They contain Planet cards, which I need to get the most value out of Constellation. The Wasteful Voucher is tempting for the extra discard, but it's not essential. And honestly, it would hurt Green Joker, so no.\n\nEssentially, the plan is:\n1.  Buy and use Venus.\n2.  Buy and use Celestial Packs.\n3.  Maybe reroll or consider Wasteful later, but right now, Constellation and Planets are the focus.\n\nSo, first up: buying and using the Venus card at shop position 2!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
