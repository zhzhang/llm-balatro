{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Priorities: Constellation Scaling in the Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the Shop phase, Ante 4, Round 9, with $42 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Green Joker, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome, boss-buster), and the key piece, Constellation. My immediate goal is to maximize score and get more scaling opportunities. Specifically, I need to get the most out of Constellation. It really takes off with Planet cards. I’ve already bought the Grabber voucher, so that's taken care of.\n\nLooking at the Shop, I see the Celestial Pack, which contains Planet cards, which I need! The Arcana Pack is also there, and a Wheel of Fortune. The Wheel of Fortune has a chance to boost a Joker, which is a good value, since I have money to spend.\n\nI've got the following options: I'll buy the Celestial Pack to scale Constellation, and then grab the Wheel of Fortune. Maybe I'll buy the Arcana pack later on. Since I've got $42, I can comfortably afford both boosters and the Wheel of Fortune.\n\nMy plan follows the pre-established order: buy Grabber, then Celestial Pack, maybe Arcana, and then potentially Wheel of Fortune.\n\nTherefore, the next action is a no-brainer: I need to buy the Celestial Pack (Booster 1) to get Planet cards. This is a high priority because it directly addresses Constellation scaling and hand leveling. I’m thinking ahead here, considering that I have an open slot for a Planet card. I can afford it, and there's no reason to delay. So, the command is `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
