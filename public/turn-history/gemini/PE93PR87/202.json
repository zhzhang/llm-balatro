{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Ante 7, Round 18**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 7, Round 18 with $30 in the bank. My primary goal, as always, is to maximize my score and get set up for Ante 8. I've got a decent Joker lineup: a Green Joker with a nice +13 Mult (Holo), Spare Trousers (+18 Mult), the Certificate for adding sealed cards, Luchador (x1.5 Mult) that's Polychrome and can disable the boss, Constellation (x3.5 Mult, but negative), and a Blue Joker (+126 Chips). I'm also holding the Judgement consumable, but I have no room for a new joker, which means I'd need to sell one.\n\nThe shop is offering a Smiley Face (+5 mult for face cards) for $4 and a Mega Standard Pack for $8. The reroll cost is $5. I just played Pluto and leveled up High Card, which scales Constellation.\n\nSmiley Face seems weak compared to what I already have, so that's out. My top priority right now is to scale Constellation because it scales with planets. The Mega Standard Pack has 5 cards and a chance to get me those planet cards. That pack is a fixed cost and a good buy to improve my card pool.\n\nLet me take a closer look at my current Jokers. I think the Blue Joker might be the first to get sold as it gives me chips. The Green Joker is not as strong, though it's Holo. The Luchador is not great, but disables the boss. Certificate is great for seals.\n\nMy hand levels aren't terrible: Three of a Kind is at 10, Pair at 9, Full House at 6, and High Card at 5. The Certificate definitely helps with sealed cards. But my scaling hinges on Planets and thus, Constellation.\n\nI have $30, and a reroll costs $5. My best bet is the Mega Standard Pack first to expand my card pool. This is a solid plan.\n\nAction: buy_booster 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
