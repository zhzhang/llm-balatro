{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Ante 5, Round 13 - The Boss Looms**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 5, Round 13. Time to optimize. I've got $23. The Boss is The Pillar, which means it debuffs cards played *this ante*. This is crucial.\n\nFirst, the inventory. Constellation is my engine (x2.4 Mult), fueled by planets. I've got Spare Trousers (+12 Mult) scaling with Two Pairs, Green Joker (+9+10 Mult) scaling with played hands, and Blue Joker (+118 Chips) scaling with deck size. Luchador (x1.5 Mult) is my clutch play – I can sell it to negate the Boss effect. This is key.\n\nThe shop offers The Emperor ($3), which creates Tarot cards, and a Standard Pack ($4). I can't buy The Emperor outright due to a full inventory. I could sell a Consumable (The Lovers, Strength), but Tarot cards aren't Planets, which means I can't scale Constellation. Strength increases a hand rank (up to 2 cards), The Lovers makes a card Wild. Neither are game-breaking right now.\n\nRerolling for planets or Celestial Packs is expensive ($9). With only $23, it's a risky move, especially with the Boss Blind incoming. The interest cap is $25, and I am close to the $4 threshold.\n\nI'm focused on scaling Constellation. The Standard Pack does little for my current strategy, adding only a few chips from Blue Joker.\n\nThe current shop is not ideal for scaling Constellation.\n\nI remember my previous hand: a Two Pair and High Card played. The Pillar will debuff those hands if played again, so I need a plan. Luchador provides the solution here. If the debuff is too punishing, I sell.\n\nI have no consumable to target in the Shop (no hand to target). `round_select` is looking like the best option.\n\nLet's double-check the shop. Selling a consumable to buy The Emperor is a gamble. Tarots are random and don't directly boost Constellation. It's probably not worth it now.\n\nMy interest calculation. $23 gets $4. Spending leaves $19 gets $3.\n\nIt's tempting to get the Standard Pack ($4), which will leave me at $19, but then I'll make a little less from interest (and it's not a lot).\n\nLet's check the Jokers again, to ensure the order is correct. Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation, Blue Joker. The total mult is (Base + 19 + 12) * 1.5 * 2.4. I believe the calculation order is correct (addition mult before multiplication mult).\n\nSo, the optimal move is `round_select`.\n\nOne last thing. If I sell a consumable, I have $24. I could get The Emperor, but I'd prefer the interest. It does not look like The Emperor is worth it.\n\nReasoning: $23 is close to interest. Shop cards don't help Constellation. Standard pack is not worth it, Joker order is fine, Luchador is ready, consumables are full but not useful in shop.\n\nA Standard Pack is okay, but I can make more money.\n\nI just realized the Boss debuffs cards *played* this ante. My current hand: Two Pair and High Card. If I replay them, they will be debuffed.\n\nBut I have Luchador! I can sell it if needed.\n\nLet's look at the last hands played again to confirm.\n\nI've only played those two hands in Ante 5, so if I try a Full House or Three of a Kind, I am okay.\n\nLet's double-check the math. Total Mult = (Base + 19 + 12) * 1.5 * 2.4. Chips = (Base + 118).\n\nMy total is more than enough.\n\nFinal decision: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
