{"reasoning":"**My Decision: Strategic Use of The Hermit for Long-Term Gain**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. Ante 6, Round 15. Big Blind. I need 3,210 chips. I have a decent hand with a pair of 4s, plus an Ace of Hearts that earns me $3 when played. I have some powerful Jokers: a Green Joker for increasing Mult, Spare Trousers, a Luchador with x1.5 Mult, Constellation with x2.5 Mult and a Steel card to make it x1.5. Plus, I have Blue Joker for extra chips, and the Hermit and The Lovers (which enhances a card into a wild card).\n\nMy current money is $28. My goal is to optimize my financial position and get the necessary chips. Using \"The Hermit\" now is the best move. It'll max out at $20, giving me $48. This'll help in the shop for future investments. I can win this round pretty easily. I can achieve the chip requirement easily.\n\nMy original plan was to play the Ace of Hearts for an extra $3, but before that, it's best to use \"The Hermit\". The Hermit takes priority, then I'll use the Ace to secure the win.\n\nI need to make sure the game understands the actions. I should generate one JSON object.\n\nThe appropriate action is: Use the Hermit.\n\nLet's use the Hermit consumable.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
