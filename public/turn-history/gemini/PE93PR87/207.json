{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Ante 7/8 - Blind Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Round 18, Boss Blind is \"The Plant\" – all face cards get debuffed, losing chip values and abilities. Target is 70,000, and I have $17. Got Director's Cut voucher for a boss blind reroll, but that's $10 and probably not needed.\n\nMy hand strategy is Three of a Kind, Pair, and Full House. The debuff *sounds* bad, but actually, I'm okay because my build isn't dependent on face card *values*, but rather their use in creating a hand. Debuffed face cards still count for hand formation, so I'm covered.\n\nI have some solid Jokers: Green Joker (+Mult, Holo), Spare Trousers (+Mult on Two Pair/Full House), a Certificate (useless now), Luchador (Polychrome x1.5 Mult - sellable to disable the Blind), Constellation (Negative x3.5 Mult), and Blue Joker (+Chips). Plus, a Judgement consumable if I want to ditch a joker, but I don't really want to do that.\n\nLet's break down my options:\n*   **Play the Round:** Target is 70,000. I've scored around 63,000 recently with a Pair. With my current setup, my approximate score, even with debuffed face cards, is ~120,000, which is over the target easily.\n*   **Sell Luchador:** Doesn't make sense. It *removes* a multiplier, which is the whole point. So, that's out.\n*   **Reroll the Blind:** \"The Plant\" is actually manageable and, from an optimization perspective, *good* as long as I can utilize non-face cards.\n*   **Sell a Joker for Judgement:** Useless, since I have a full hand.\n\nThe Boss effect isn't threatening at all. I have the multipliers to hit this score. Therefore, I'm going to play the round as is. With the recent play to a Pair, I can easily exceed the target of 70,000.\n\nOkay, let's double-check. I'm focusing on Three of a Kind or even a Full House using non-face cards, so debuffing face cards is irrelevant. I will still get the 70,000 requirement.\n\nNow, let's optimize the Joker order. How is this set up?\n\nHere's the current order: Green (+Mult), Trousers (+Mult), Certificate, Luchador (xMult), Constellation (xMult), Blue (+Chips).\n\nLet's quickly check the scoring order: Chips, \"On Scored\" Jokers, Independent Jokers. \"Independent Jokers\" go left-to-right.\n\nThe Blue Joker, which adds Chips, belongs in the *Chips* calculation. Jokers that are \"+X Mult\" are *added* to the Mult calculation before the multipliers are applied. The order looks good for multipliers: additive, then multiplicative.\n\nGreen (+), Trousers (+), Luchador (x), Constellation (x).\n\nPerfect. That's the correct order.\n\n**Action: Play Round.**\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
