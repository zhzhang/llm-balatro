{"reasoning":"**My Ante 2 Shop Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 2, Round 2. I've got $9, and this shop is crucial. I've got a decent Joker setup already: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, and my new Polychrome Luchador. I need to make the best possible play here, optimizing my scoring potential.\n\nI've got the Luchador, which is Polychrome, so that x1.5 multiplier is going to be key. I know the order matters for Jokers; I need the additive mults from Smiley Face and Mystic Summit to trigger *before* the Polychrome multiplier. Good thing I checked – edition effects are part of the base Joker ability in this game, so the left-to-right order *already* works perfectly. I'm leaving Luchador last.\n\nNow, looking at the shop: The Tower is tempting for stone cards but isn't a priority. The vouchers are out, and rerolling is a waste of money here. So I have to choose between Buffoon and Celestial Packs.\n\nI’m thinking Buffoon Pack first, to find potential Jokers. I always need better jokers.\n\nThe ideal play is to buy both packs if I can. That’s $8, leaving me with $1. That’s a valid option here. \n\nI’ll start with the Buffoon Pack. And I’m going for it.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
