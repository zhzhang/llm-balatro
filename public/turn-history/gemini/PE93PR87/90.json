{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Decision: Grabber Voucher**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 9. I've got $52 and a solid, if slightly quirky, joker setup. Constellation is the key here - that's where the real scaling is. Currently, it's at x2.0, so every planet card I can play is crucial. The Hieroglyph voucher is hampering me, taking away a hand and setting me back.\n\nMy initial thought is to grab the Grabber voucher. It’s the obvious play – an extra hand every round for $10 is fantastic, especially with Hieroglyph in play, effectively adding a hand. I can't think of any scenario where I would not choose the grabber when the shop is open.\n\nI've got a Celestial Pack ($4) on offer, which is tempting because it can trigger Constellation immediately and level up a hand. The Arcana Pack ($4) could be good for deck manipulation, but I'm not seeing any pressing needs there. Wheel of Fortune ($3) is a gamble, but potentially useful. Mail-In Rebate is available, but that's a non-starter; I'm not selling any of my current jokers for it.\n\nThe primary goal is to maximize Constellation's scaling and keep the economy/efficiency high. So, I see it as: **buy Grabber, then Celestial Pack, maybe Arcana, and then potentially Wheel of Fortune.**\n\nI just used Venus, so the shop is open, and Grabber is the most impactful permanent upgrade available. I can buy the voucher, then the Celestial Pack. Then the Arcana Pack, and finally the Wheel of Fortune. If I can, that is.\n\nSo, I’ve got to start with the Grabber voucher. It's the safest and most logical progression. It's $10, leaving me with $42. I'll get that first. Then I can buy the Celestial Pack ($4), leaving me with $38. Then I'll check what my remaining money will be.\n\nI will verify the positions one last time... shop vouchers at position 1: Grabber.\n\nSo, the action is `buy_voucher` with position `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
