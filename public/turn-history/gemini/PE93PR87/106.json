{"reasoning":"**Current Evaluation: Round 10 Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop, with $26. My main goal is to optimize for the next round, and maybe beyond. Let's see. My current Jokers are solid: the Green Joker is at +14 Mult, Mystic Summit at +15, Spare Trousers is a scaling +4. Luchador is for that boss, Constellation gives me an extra joker, and Certificate gives me a random card. \n\nThe shop has Supernova for $5. It adds mult based on times a poker hand has been played. But looking at the numbers, it's just not an upgrade right now – it'd be +4 for Full House (which is my highest level hand) or even less for the other hands. Not worth it.\n\nThen there's The Chariot. It's a Steel Card consumable. But wait a minute... I can't *use* The Chariot right now because I'm in the SHOP phase. I don't have a hand to target! \"use_consumable ... Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets\". I have to remember that cards are only \"in hand\" during the Blind Select phase or the Round phase. I'm sure that I've seen a hand, so let's look at Turn 105. Yes, there was a hand! But in Turn 106, there's no hand. That confirms it. So the Chariot is not useful *right now*.\n\nSo, what are my options? I have $26, a perfect amount to get $5 in interest. I could reroll, but there's nothing compelling in the shop. I have full Joker slots. I've bought The Chariot, and I've evaluated the shop.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to move to `round_select` and preserve my money for interest. That's the only logical move. No changes in the current set up are needed to get to the next round.\n`action`: \"round_select\"\n`positions`: null\n`intended_hand_type`: null\n`estimated_chips`: null\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
