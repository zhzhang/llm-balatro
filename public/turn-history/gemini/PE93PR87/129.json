{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis for Ante 5, Round 12: A Calculated Skip**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Small Blind's up – 11,000 chips needed. I'm currently holding a Garbage Tag that offers a nice $31 reward for skipping. I only have $17 right now. My Joker setup is looking *very* strong for this stage: Green Joker (+18 Mult), Spare Trousers (+10 Mult), Certificate (adds card), Luchador (Boss Disabler), Constellation (x2.3 Mult, +1 Joker Slot, currently a negative). Then I also have a Blue Joker with +118 Chips.\n\nPlaying the Small Blind would yield roughly $10 (reward + interest + hands). Skipping nets me a clean $31. Now, $31 is a game changer at this point, nearly doubling my bankroll. My scaling Jokers would benefit from playing, but the economy boost from $31 is far more valuable in the long run. I need money for rerolls and to buy the expensive shop packs, especially to find Planets for Constellation. This Boss Blind (The Ox) is \"Decrease level of played poker hand\". Luchador can disable this, but 22k is not an issue with my jokers right now.\n\nA Pair (Lvl 5) is estimated to give (70 + 118) * (6 + 18 + 10) * 3.45 = 22,052 chips. This clearly one-shots the small and big blinds, as well as the boss. My deck is overpowered right now. So it's best to prioritize the economy and skip this round.\n\nMy Jokers are already in the optimal order for scoring. Green and Spare give additive mults, so are on the left. Then the multiplicative mults (Luchador and Constellation). Then the Blue Joker. This is perfect.\n\nSo, the action is to skip the round.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
