{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Analysis for the Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here we are in Ante 4, Round 11, at the SHOP. I have $30, which is perfect for maximizing interest. My primary focus right now is to scale my existing multipliers, and I've got a solid core strategy in place with high-frequency Two Pair/Three of a Kind hands, leaning heavily on Joker synergies – specifically Green Joker, Spare Trousers, and Constellation.\n\nI've got six Jokers in total – Green, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, and Constellation (which is Negative, meaning it takes up 0 slots). I'm at my Joker limit. That means I have no free slots.\n\nLooking at the SHOP, the Acrobat joker (X3 mult on the final hand) is tempting, but my build focuses on winning in fewer hands, so it's probably not the best fit right now. The Onyx Agate (+7 Mult for Clubs) is too specific and doesn't mesh with my current strategy.\n\nMy core thought is this: *reroll*! I really need to try and find Planets to scale Constellation. Spending $5 will leave me at $25, which keeps me at the maximum interest level.\n\nI need to quickly assess my Jokers, and consider possible sales: Luchador, Mystic Summit, Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate.\n\nGiven this, I have a few things I'm sure of: I'm rerolling the shop, hoping for a Planet. My decision tree is simple:\n*   Reroll for Planets/scaling Jokers.\n\nTherefore, the action is `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
