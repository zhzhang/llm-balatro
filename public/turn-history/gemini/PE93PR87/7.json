{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment of the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, so the ante is 1/8, and this is the first round, the Boss Blind. The Boss Blind, \"The Hook,\" is going to discard two random cards each hand. I need 600 chips to beat it. I've got a Smiley Face Joker, which gives +5 mult for face cards, and a Mystic Summit Joker, which gives +15 mult if I make no discards. I only have a single dollar right now. The Polychrome Tag is a nice bonus; the next Joker in the shop will be free and Polychrome.\n\nCurrently, all my hands are at Level 1, except for Full House, which I've played once, but the levels are standard. I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase, specifically deciding on playing this Boss Blind.\n\nLet's break down the situation. The Boss needs 600 chips. The Jokers are the key here. Smiley Face is good for face cards, and Mystic Summit requires zero discards. The Boss's ability to discard two cards each hand is the primary challenge. It doesn't directly hurt scoring, but it’ll make constructing hands much harder.\n\nThe only valid action at this point in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase when I’m facing a Boss Blind is `play_round`. I have no consumables to play or sell. I *could* rearrange the Jokers, but both are additive multiplier Jokers, so the order usually doesn’t matter, unless I had any xMult Jokers, and this is not the case. It is good practice, though, to put +Mult before xMult, so I will keep this in mind as the game progresses. Also, selling a Joker right now would be foolish.\n\nMy action then is clear: `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
