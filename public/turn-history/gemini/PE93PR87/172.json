{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Scaling Constellation**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in the Shop after beating the Ante 6 Boss, sitting on $61. My immediate goal is to conquer Ante 7 and 8. Looking at my Jokers, I have a solid setup: a Green Joker providing +22 Mult, Spare Trousers adding +16 Mult via Two Pair synergy, a Certificate throwing in a random sealed card, Luchador offering a 1.5x Mult boost, and, crucially, a Constellation Joker which is currently at 2.8x Mult that scales with Planet cards. I also have a Blue Joker with a +124 chip bonus. Inventory is one \"The Lovers\" consumable, and in the Shop, I see \"Scary Face\" and \"High Priestess\" cards, a Standard and an Arcana Pack, and a Director's Cut Voucher.\n\nThe key here is the High Priestess. I have a plan: Buy the High Priestess for $3 and use it. This will cost me $3, leaving me with $58.  The High Priestess creates two Planet cards, which are exactly what I need to trigger the Constellation Joker.  That's a x0.2 boost on top of the x2.8 it currently has. Buying and using the High Priestess is the clear, optimal play. I will then have The Lovers in one slot and the two planet cards created by The High Priestess in the other slot.\n\nI know I need to specify an action using a JSON object. I've already determined that the correct action is `buy_and_use_consumable` with the High Priestess at position `[2]`.  I'm double-checking the command description and the schema now.\n\nOkay, I'm confident. The correct action is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_and_use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\nI'm making sure my reasoning is clear.  Using the High Priestess is the immediate priority for the Constellation multiplier boost.  I have the money, the slot, and this is the best possible play.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
