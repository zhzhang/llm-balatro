{"reasoning":"**My Analysis of the Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm staring at the Celestial Pack selection screen. It's Round 9, with an ante of 4/8, and I've got $38 in the bank. Let's see, my Joker lineup is looking pretty solid: Green Joker (Holo), Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador (the boss-buster), and that pesky Constellation.\n\nNow, my hand levels are: Full House Level 4 (good base chips and mult), Pair Level 4 (solid fallback), Three of a Kind Level 4, and some lower levels for other hands. I'm focusing on consistent, high-scoring hands.\n\nI have three planets to choose from: Pluto (High Card, not really my style), Mercury (Pair, leveling up a hand I already play, Level 4 to 5), and Mars (Four of a Kind, a big jump, Level 1 to 2, but harder to hit).\n\nThe crucial point: any planet selection will trigger Constellation, which will increase my Multiplier. Constellation is currently at x2.0 but will go up to x2.1 with any planet selected.\n\nMy goal is to pick the planet that gives me the most utility, or strengthens a hand I can *actually* play. Mercury, leveling a Pair, is a *reliable* option because Pairs are easy to come by, even as part of other hands (though only the scoring hand counts).\n\nMars gives a much bigger boost, leveling a Four of a Kind, but is tougher to pull off, even with Certificate adding some extra cards. Pluto is just not good.\n\nConsidering past hand history, Three of a Kind, Full House, and Flushes have been my bread and butter. Spare Trousers rewards Two Pair. Two Pair contains a Pair, and is fairly easy to get.\n\nWhile leveling up a Pair is consistent, and is level 4, Mercury would get me to Level 5. Strengthening a hand I actually *play* is the priority. Actually, strengthening Pair is a good option since it's easy to pivot to.\n\nMercury is the best choice here. Leveling up Pair offers the most consistent value, while allowing me to pivot to Two Pair. Leveling Four of a Kind is a better scaling value, but is harder to trigger.\n\n**Action: Select Mercury**\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
