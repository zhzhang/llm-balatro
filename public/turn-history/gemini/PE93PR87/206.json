{"reasoning":"**Round Selection: Prioritizing Planet Acquisition**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 7, Round 18, with $17 in the bank. The primary objective is to scale Constellation, which needs Planets, and prepare for Ante 8. The current shop has: Gluttonous Joker, Smeared Joker, and Judgement (consumable).\n\nLooking at the Jokers, Green Joker (+13+10 Mult), Spare Trousers (+18 Mult), Certificate (Utility), Luchador (Polychrome x1.5 Mult, Boss disable), Constellation (Negative x3.5 Mult), and Blue Joker (+130 Chips). With 6/6 Jokers, I'm at capacity.\n\nThe shop cards aren't directly helpful to the strategy right now. Gluttonous Joker gives +3 Mult for Clubs, while Smeared Joker lets suits count as others; not useful for current strategy. Rerolling the shop for $6 is an option, but with the interest calculations ($1 for every $5), I could lose more than I gain, depending on the round. If I keep $15, I get $3 interest. If I spend $6 and have $11 left, I'd get $2 interest.\n\nI have to consider the \"Judgement\" card. To use it, I'd need to sell a Joker. Blue Joker provides a decent chip boost (+130), but might be replaceable, given the others are multipliers. Selling any of my Jokers feels risky, given my scaling goal.\n\nI've got a Blue Seal in my deck! This means I need to play rounds and let it trigger. Since the shop is unhelpful, and I don't need to sell anything, I'm going to proceed to round select to increase my chances of drawing the Seal and getting Planets. The shop isn't providing any boosts, and the cards aren't necessary.\n\nI will rearrange the Jokers, but not sell anything. Order doesn't matter, but +Mult should come before xMult.\n1.
