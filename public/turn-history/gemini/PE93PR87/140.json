{"reasoning":"**The Crucial Reroll**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 5/8, Round 13, right before the Boss Blind, The Pillar, which is a real pain since it debuffs cards *already played* this ante. I've got $41, and my hand is looking alright. My main scaling engine is Constellation, which is sitting at x2.3 mult. The problem is, I need Planets. I'm running with a good core of Jokers: a Green Joker (Holo, +9 Mult, +10 Mult edition), Spare Trousers (+12 Mult, scales with Two Pair), Certificate (Adds sealed cards to hand at start of round), Luchador (Polychrome, x1.5 Mult, can sell to disable Boss), and a Blue Joker (+118 chips, based on deck size).\n\nThe shop is currently offering Superposition ($4), Wily Joker ($4), and a Standard Pack ($4). Superposition is useless, requires a specific hand, and I don't have space for more Jokers anyway. Wily Joker isn't synergistic with my Two Pair strategy. The Standard Pack would slightly benefit the Blue Joker but that's not what I need here. I need Planets to help scale my Constellation Joker!\n\nI've got the Tarot Merchant, Grabber, Hieroglyph Vouchers and two consumables: The Lovers (Wild card), and Strength (+rank).\n\nThe Luchador is interesting for dealing with The Pillar. I can sell it mid-round to get rid of the annoying debuff. But right now, my focus is the shop.\n\nI've already rerolled twice this shop, so the cost is $7 now, but I have plenty of cash and Constellation is a x2.3 multiplier, every planet is a x0.1 increase, which is a very high ROI. I can easily afford another reroll.\n\nLet's do it. I'm rerolling the shop for Planet cards or Celestial Packs. I need to push that Constellation multiplier as high as possible for the late game. I'm going to take the action of `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
