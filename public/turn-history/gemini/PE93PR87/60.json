{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop, Round 6 of Ante 3, with $38 in the bank. My goal, as always, is to maximize my score potential and build a robust scaling engine. I have a decent set of Jokers already: a Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation, and a Certificate. I also have a single Mercury consumable.\n\nRight now, the most logical move is to use that Mercury card. It'll level up my Pair hand to level 4 and, crucially, bump the Constellation multiplier from X1.5 to X1.6. This is a solid, direct improvement to my current core build, focusing on multi-heavy scaling.\n\nAfter that, I'll reassess the shop. Let's see... the options are:\n\n*   **Wasteful Voucher ($10):** A +1 discard would be great for more hand flexibility, synergizing with my Spare Trousers Joker for Two Pair scaling, but it directly conflicts with the Mystic Summit, which gives +15 Multi when I have 0 discards left, meaning I'd have to discard twice instead of once to get its benefit. I might hold off if I want to rely on Mystic Summit early.\n*   **Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6):** Always a solid choice for finding Tarot cards to enhance the deck or generate money.\n*   **Standard Pack ($4):** Good for adding cards to the deck, which potentially can give me more value out of Certificate.\n*   **Splash (Foil) ($5):** Gives +50 chips. My current build is multi-heavy. I need chips, and Splash at $5 with Foil (+50 chips) is actually quite good for points. The \"Every card counts\" effect is niche, but it's still good.\n*   **Lusty Joker ($5):** Heart cards +3 Mult. Not very synergistic with my current Spades/Diamonds heavy hand, but cheap.\n\nAlright, step one: *use* the Mercury consumable. I'll take a look at the shop *after* this. Then I'll re-evaluate.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
