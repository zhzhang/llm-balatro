{"reasoning":"**The Ante 7 Crossroads: A Strategic Reckoning**\n\nAlright, here's the situation: We're in Ante 7, Round 17 – the crucial Big Blind, with a hefty 52,500 chip requirement looming, and the subsequent Boss to worry about. My primary focus is to build enough scoring power to comfortably clear these hurdles, and then get ready for Ante 8.\n\nMy current build hinges on Constellation, a x3.2 multiplier that I'm actively trying to scale with Planets. Additive multipliers come from my Green Joker (+23), and Spare Trousers (+18), with Luchador (x1.5) also in the mix. The Blue Joker provides a solid chunk of chips (+124).\n\nThe shop presents a Gift Card and Crazy Joker. The Gift Card, while potentially good for long runs, is irrelevant now. I need immediate power. The Crazy Joker is for Straights, which I'm not playing.\n\nThe key question is whether to reroll the shop again or proceed to the next round. Rerolling would be to find Planet packs, or individual Planet cards. With $25 in hand, a reroll will cost me $6, leaving me with $19, but will get me closer to Planet cards. The alternative is to bank the interest (which caps at $5), and hope for a better shop next round.\n\nMy current high hand is ~36k chips, which doesn't hit the 52.5k target, so I need to improve. A Three of a Kind comfortably hits ~100k, and I've already optimized the Joker order for this.\n\nI've already used a couple of Planets this shop. The reroll is a gamble. Should I go for it? It's a debate of short-term gain versus long-term economy. I'm going to lean towards scaling Constellation further for Ante 8 by rerolling one more time. The interest will not be missed as much as having a powerful scaling multiplier.\n\nHold on, I see the shop state has now refreshed. There's nothing truly useful on the screen, only the Gift Card and Crazy Joker. Rerolling a single time is the decision. If I find something good, great. If not, I can at least maximize interest by moving to the round screen.\n\nAfter the reroll, it's time to face facts: there's nothing useful in the shop. The safe play is to preserve my money. It is time to enter the blind selection screen.\n\nJust to be safe, I'm verifying the current Joker order (Green, Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation, Blue). It's optimal for maximizing multiplier application. I'll make a final inspection of the numbers, and proceed to the Big Blind, confident I can win. I re-read the Luchador description - it appears to have a bit of a typo in the description, but I can ignore the extra text.\n\nI've re-considered all the shop options. Is there any reason to delay? No. I'll take a final look to make sure. I'm choosing `round_select` to proceed to the next blind.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
