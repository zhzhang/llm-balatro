{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision Making**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 17. I've got $30. My key Jokers are Constellation (x3.2 Multiplier, Planet card scaling), Spare Trousers (+18 Multiplier, Two Pair synergy), Green Joker (+13 Multiplier, +10 Holo), Luchador (1.5x Polychrome, boss disable), Certificate and Blue Joker (+124 Chips). The shop currently has a Rough Gem for $7. Hand levels are Three of a Kind (Lvl 10), Pair (Lvl 8), Full House (Lvl 6) and Two Pair (Lvl 2). I'm focusing on scaling Constellation via Planet cards and boosting Spare Trousers with Two Pair plays.\n\nMy initial thought is that the Rough Gem isn't very impactful right now. It provides only $1 per Diamond card, and with a limited inventory of only six Jokers, I have no reason to sell anything.  I just used Neptune. Now the shop is just Rough Gem. I have $30. Reroll is $5.\n\nTherefore, the critical decision is whether to reroll the shop for potentially better cards, specifically Planet cards, or to advance to the next blind.  Rerolling costs $5. I need Planet cards to trigger Constellation, and I want to find them in the shop.  With $30, spending $5 to reroll is affordable. Advancing to the next blind means missing out on this chance to improve Constellation.\n\nI've already optimized the Joker order for Multiplier stacking: Green Joker (+13 + 10 edition), Spare Trousers (+18), Luchador (X1.5), and Constellation (X3.2). The Blue Joker is positioned last, and is independent of the other multipliers.\n\nConsidering all this, it's clear that the best move is to reroll the shop.\nThe action is `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
