{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decisions - Ante 5, Round 12**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 5, Round 12, and it's shop time. I've got $37 and a decent Joker setup: Green Joker (hand scaling), Mystic Summit (+15 Mult but conditional), Spare Trousers (Two Pair scaling), Certificate (seal cards), Luchador (Polychrome, Boss disable), and Constellation (Negative, Planet card scaling). I'm at the max Joker limit (6 slots, thanks to Constellation). My hand levels are decent: Three of a Kind at level 6, Pair at level 5, Full House at level 4, and Two Pair at level 1, but scaling with Spare Trousers.\n\nMy current focus is clearing Ante 5 and eventually getting to Ante 8. Constellation and Spare Trousers are my current scalers, and the Green Joker is a solid foundation. Given my set up and amount of chips, I really want Planet cards to make Constellation go crazy.\n\nThe Shop cards aren't perfect, but they could be useful. \"Shoot the Moon\" isn't a build I'm going for, but +13 Mult is okay. \"Ice Cream\" for +100 chips is great, especially since I'm lacking on chips, but I have no space for it. The shop has a \"Mega Buffoon Pack,\" \"Arcana Pack,\" and a Tarot Merchant voucher.\n\nMy priority is Planet cards to pump up Constellation. Rerolling the shop to hunt for Planet cards is the ideal play. I need to make some decisions.\n\nCurrently, I have about 28 flat Mult mid-round or 43 end-round, with about a 3.45x multiplier, leading to around ~96 to ~148 total Mult. With the current scaling, I need planet cards.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are to grab the Tarot Merchant first, since it's a permanent buff, then maybe the Arcana Pack for deck manipulation or money. The Mega Buffoon Pack is tempting for potential Joker upgrades, but it's not a priority and will require a replacement. Reroll is an option if the shop doesn't give me what I want.\n\nComparing the \"Ice Cream\" to \"Mystic Summit,\" I have about 70 base chips with my Pair and 130 with 3 of a Kind. The Ice Cream would put me at about 170 chips, but this is compared to 85 Mult from Summit (with hand clears). The chips would be a huge boon early. However, the potential from the Buffoon Pack for something like a \"Blueprint\" or \"Burnt Joker\" is more attractive.\n\nI quickly check the Joker limit again. With Constellation as Negative, it's a non-issue; it adds a slot, not consume it, so I am indeed full. The Negative effect is the bonus.\n\nI calculate my spending: $10 for Tarot Merchant, $4 for Arcana Pack, and $8 for Mega Buffoon Pack ($22 total) plus $5 for a reroll, and I have enough to buy what I need.\n\nMy strategy: Buy the Arcana Pack first (Planet card potential). Then buy Tarot Merchant. Then I'll re-evaluate the shop after I've opened the pack.\n\nI'm ready to buy the Arcana Pack; it's the best first step. The command is `buy_booster 2`. That's the appropriate action.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
