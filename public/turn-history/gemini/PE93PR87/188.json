{"reasoning":"**Analysis of the Shop Phase: Maximizing Constellation Joker**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. I'm in Ante 7/8, Round 17, and in a Tarot Pack shop, looking to squeeze every last point out of this run. I've got $30, a solid Joker setup with a Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome), Constellation, and a Blue Joker, plus The Lovers consumable. I also have a few vouchers, but right now, I'm laser-focused on the immediate play.\n\nI need to get the most value out of Constellation, which increases its multiplier by x0.1 for every Planet card played. I'm eyeing the High Priestess Tarot card, which creates Planet cards. Currently, it's at x3.0. The obvious play is to use High Priestess, but here's the kicker: The High Priestess creates \"up to 2\" Planets. My single consumable slot is occupied by The Lovers.\n\nIf I select High Priestess *now*, I get *one* Planet card. Not ideal. If I use The Lovers *first* I free up a slot, and then I select High Priestess and get *two* Planet cards. Double the planets, double the Constellation boost. So, that's what I need to do: use the consumable *before* selecting the High Priestess. The command to use is `use_consumable`. I can use The Lovers to make one of my cards wild, and in doing so, free up a slot in my hand. Then I'll have two free slots. That's optimal for maximizing the Constellation.\n\nI want to check what cards I should turn into a Wild Card, and the 10 of Spades (position 2), seems ideal. It's not enhanced and it's not a steel or gold card.\n\nOkay, let's step back for a second and look at the specifics. The game's pretty clear on the mechanics. Constellation only cares about how many Planets are *played*, so two is better than one. I know I have 1/2 consumables, and the description of High Priestess says \"Creates *up to* 2 random Planet cards (Must have room)\". I need to use \"The Lovers\" *before* picking up the High Priestess.\n\nSo the correct command is: `use_consumable 1 2`.\n\nNow, before committing, I'm checking that that this is available while inside the shop. The commands list confirms it: `use_consumable` is there. It's the only logical choice!\n\nAnd I *need* to be sure: One more look: I have space. I have the Lovers at slot 1, and the current hand at 8 cards, which will allow me to have 2 planet cards. The High Priestess says \"up to\" two. If I select it now, I only get one planet.\n\nAnd with that final check, it's clear: `use_consumable` on card 2. After that, I select the High Priestess in the next turn and get the planet cards.\n\nSo, in JSON, the command I need is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 2]\n}\n```\n\nThat's the play to maximize Constellation, simple as that.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,2]"}
