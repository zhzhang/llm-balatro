{"reasoning":"**The Play: A Calculated Full House for Maximum Value**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Big Blind, round five, needing 1200 chips. I have $6 and three hands remaining. Let's see... the hand in front of me: two Queens, three Jacks, a King, a Glass Ace, and a Blue Seal 7 of Diamonds. The Mystic Summit joker gives a fat +15 Multi because I have no discards left, and that's *key*. The Smiley Face joker will be very effective since I'm going to play a hand full of face cards (+5 Mult per). The Spare Trousers joker gets +2 Mult if I play a Two Pair or a Full House, which I can, and plan on doing. I have the Luchador, which is polychrome and gives X1.5 Mult, and I also have the Constellation, which gives X1.1 Mult. Finally, I have the 7 of Diamonds (Blue Seal), which will provide a Planet Card at the end of the round.\n\nFirst, I consider a Full House of Jacks and Queens. Jacks (Jc, Jd, Jh) and Queens (Qs, Qc). This hand will score a base 40 chips and will earn 10 chip for each card played. The base multi for a Full House is 4, plus the Smiley Face bonus (5 face cards * 5 = +25), plus the Mystic Summit (+15). The subtotal is 44 Mult. The Luchador is X1.5 Mult, and the Constellation is X1.1. So my total Mult is 44 * 1.5 * 1.1, which ends up being 72.6, so the total score is 90 * 72.6 = 6534. This is much higher than what I need to clear the Big Blind, so the Glass Ace remains unused for this round.\n\nNow, wait... What about the Spare Trousers? The card description says \"This Joker gains +2 Mult if played hand contains a Two Pair.\" But this only works for *future* hands, not this one.\n\nLet's check the alternative. If I play Two Pair (Queens and Jacks), it is base 20 chips, 2 mult, plus 71 chips from the card. Smiley Face with 4 face cards is +20, Mystic Summit is +15. And my modifiers: a X2 from the Glass Ace, X1.5 from Luchador, and X1.1 from Constellation. Total score: 8669.1. It is risky though, as the Glass Ace can break.\n\nI'll be playing a Full House. My hand is: Jc, Jd, Jh, Qs, Qc, in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. This is the optimal play.\n\nAfter checking the descriptions and doing some final calculations, the base multi is 4, then +25 from Smiley Face and +15 from Mystic Summit. So, total chips: 90. The overall Multi: 72.6. Total Score: 6534. Easy.\n\nI double-checked to make sure that the order of the cards in the hand list correspond to the number positions I have used, and that they are exactly as I need them to be. I am also planning on keeping the 7 of Diamonds (Blue Seal) in my hand for the Planet Card at the end of the round. This will be the final played poker hand. With this win, I move on to the Boss Blind.\n\nI am playing these cards: Qs, Jh, Qc, Jc, Jd.\nThe intended hand: Full House.\nEstimated score: 6500.\n\nI'm playing the Full House. Let's do this.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,7]"}
