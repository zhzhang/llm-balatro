{"reasoning":"**The Plan for The Pillar**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 2, Round 4, facing The Pillar. This boss debuffs cards played previously in the Ante, which means the previous Two Pair I played in the Small Blind might be affected. My goal is 1600 chips. I've got a decent hand, and some key items.\n\nI've got Smiley Face (+5 mult for face cards), Mystic Summit (+15 mult at 0 discards), Luchador (X1.5 mult), Constellation (X1.1 mult), and a Certificate. My hand is: Ace of Diamonds (Glass, +11 chips, X2 mult), Queen of Spades (+10), King of Hearts (+10), 5 of Hearts (+5), Ace of Clubs (+11), King of Clubs (+10), 10 of Clubs (+10), and 9 of Clubs (+9).\n\nMy key is the Glass Ace, and activating Mystic Summit. I need to get to 0 discards. I have 3 discards left, and $1. I'm aiming for a Two Pair (Aces and Kings) or maybe a Full House if I'm lucky with the discards.\n\nSo, I need to focus on what to discard. The Glass Ace is a huge bonus. I need to get rid of the cards that don't fit into my best hand - the 5 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs, and 9 of Clubs.\n\nI need to confirm if the Aces and Kings are debuffed. The reasoning from the last turn strongly suggests a Two Pair of Aces and Kings was used, and those cards were in my hand. Let's assume the worst: they're debuffed. However, the Glass Ace isn't, since it wasn't on the table yet.\n\nSo, my action is clear: I need to discard cards to trigger Mystic Summit, and then hope that I get lucky with the best hand. The discards are positions 4, 7, and 8.\n\n**Action: `discard` positions [4, 7, 8].**\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,7,8]"}
