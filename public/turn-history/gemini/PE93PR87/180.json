{"reasoning":"**Reroll for Planets to Scale Constellation**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7/8, heading into \"The Pillar\" boss blind. My current money is $35, which is above the interest cap of $25, so I can comfortably afford to spend some to improve my setup. My Jokers are pretty good: I have a Holo Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador (boss disable), Constellation (negative, but x2.9 multiplier, which I'm building around), and a Blue Joker for chips. I also have the Lovers consumable (1/2). I've got vouchers like Director's Cut (reroll), Tarot Merchant, Grabber, and Hieroglyph.\n\nThe current shop has The Sun (converts cards to hearts) for $3 and Pareidolia (all cards become face cards) for $5. I'm focusing on scaling Constellation, which thrives on planets. The Sun doesn't help me, and Pareidolia could be useful against certain bosses, but it makes The Mark harder and doesn't synergize immediately with my current plan.\n\nSince I need Planets to scale Constellation, and the reroll cost is now $6, I'm going to spend $6 to reroll the shop. This seems like the best play to find the cards I need. My current play will be: `reroll_shop`. I can do it, as I have $35, so I will spend $6 and still have $29 to play with.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
