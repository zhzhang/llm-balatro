{"reasoning":"**Shop Analysis: Joker Slot Management and Optimal Play**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. It's Ante 2, Round 5, and I'm in the SHOP step. I've got $5 and a full house of Jokers – six to be exact. Let's run through them again, just to be sure. I have: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation (Negative), and Certificate.\n\nNow, the crucial thing is the Joker slot limit. The game state tells me \"Max Jokers: 6,\" and Constellation is the \"Negative\" version which adds a Joker slot.  Since Constellation is a Negative joker, the slot is effectively 6.  I have 6 Jokers, meaning I *should* be at my limit.\n\nI tried to buy a card in the first slot and the buy action failed, the error message clearly stating that I can't. That confirms it, I am maxed out. Even though Constellation adds a slot, I'm still at the hard limit.\n\nThe shop offers the Egg and the Sly Joker, but I can't buy either because I'm full. The Egg is tempting for the economy, but am I really going to sell a scoring joker to buy it? Let's assess:\n\nI could sell Smiley Face (Common, +5 Mult to face cards), Mystic Summit (Common, +15 Mult when no discards), Certificate (Uncommon, adds a sealed card each round), or even Spare Trousers (+2 Mult for Two Pair which will scale), but those jokers are so vital to my strategy. I'm already crushing the blinds, and I have a $25 Investment Tag on the horizon. My mults right now are Mystic Summit (+15), Smiley Face (+5/face), Spare Trousers (+2), and the X mults from Luchador (X1.5) and Constellation (X1.4). Even if I didn't have Smiley Face and only played two face cards, that's already a high base mult.\n\nIn the end, selling any of my current Jokers for the Egg or Sly Joker feels like a downgrade at this stage. Certificate is great long term; Spare Trousers are excellent for scaling; Luchador and Constellation are critical for multiplicative mult, and Mystic Summit is a huge flat mult boost. Smiley Face is the weakest, but it's still decent.\n\nSo, I'm going to proceed to the next round. I've assessed the situation. I'm not selling any Jokers to make room, I'm in a good spot for this ante.\n\nBefore I go, let's just make sure the Joker order is optimized: Smiley, Mystic, Spare, Luchador, Constellation, Certificate. I have the additive mults (1, 2, 3) to the left of the multiplicative mults (4, 5). Perfect. Certificate can go anywhere since it doesn't score.\n\nFinal Decision: Move to Round Select. Action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
