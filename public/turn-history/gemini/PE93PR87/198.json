{"reasoning":"**My Turn in the Shop**\n\nOkay, here we are in the Shop phase of Ante 7, Round 18, with $37 in the bank. The goal, as always, is to crush the Ante 7 boss and move on to Ante 8. I've got a solid Joker setup: Green Joker (a nice +13 Mult, Holo), Spare Trousers (+18), the Certificate, Luchador (x1.5), Constellation (currently at x3.3, which is key), and Blue Joker (+126 Chips), bringing me to 6/6 Jokers, plus a Judgement consumable.\n\nThe Shop has some interesting options. There's Smiley Face (a potential +5 Mult for face cards, which *could* be useful, but I'd have to sacrifice a strong Joker for it; probably not worth it), Pluto (a Planet card - and *very* relevant), an Arcana Pack (always a good bet for deck thinning and enhancements), and a Mega Standard Pack (for more deck tinkering).\n\nMy Pair is Level 9, Three of a Kind is Level 10, so I'm well on my way. I recently used Mercury to level up Pair and give Constellation a boost. The current strategy is centered on Constellation, which scales with Planet cards.\n\nAha! Pluto is the key here. Buying Pluto for a mere $3 will immediately bump Constellation up to x3.4, making it more powerful. This seems like the obvious play. I'm also considering the Arcana Pack for further deck enhancements.\n\nThe Judgment consumable is tempting, but I can't use it right now because I'm at my Joker limit. So, the play is clear: I'm going to *buy_and_use_consumable* at position [2], which is the Pluto card. This will immediately support my scaling strategy with Constellation. This is the optimal play right now. No need to overthink it - get that Pluto.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
