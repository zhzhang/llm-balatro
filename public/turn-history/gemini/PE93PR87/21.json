{"reasoning":"**Shop Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2, Round 3, $7 in the bank. I'm in the SHOP phase. I've got Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, and Constellation as my Jokers. I'm aiming for a strategy that leverages Constellation, which thrives on Planets, and Mystic Summit, which requires zero discards. I have one consumable slot open.\n\nThe shop presents a few options: The Hanged Man, Certificate, Arcana Pack, Mega Arcana Pack, and Wasteful. I immediately rule out the Mega Pack and Wasteful due to the cost. The Hanged Man might be okay for deck thinning later, but it isn't worth it at this stage.\n\nMy primary concern is finding Planets to scale Constellation. The Arcana Pack could give me a Planet immediately. But the Certificate, an Uncommon Joker, is intriguing. It adds a *random* card with a seal at the start of each round. Seals have significant power: Gold for money, Red for re-triggering, Blue for Planets (Constellation synergy!), and Purple for Tarot cards, which can eventually lead to Planets.\n\nI can afford the Certificate for $6. The alternative is to buy the Arcana Pack for $4 and hope to get money, but that's a gamble. It is a long-term strategy, and with my limited funds, it makes more sense to grab the guaranteed value. The Certificate will also provide discard fodder for Mystic Summit and face cards for Smiley Face.\n\nConstellation provides a Joker slot due to its negative edition, so Certificate will fill one of my slots (5/6). Given the consistent benefit of the Certificate's cards, I believe it is a stronger pick now than it would be later.\n\nI will buy the Certificate.\n\nHere is the JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_card\", \"positions\": [2], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
