{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Play**\n\nOkay, Ante 8, Round 20, time to maximize this run. My goal is to crush this final stretch and handle that Verdant Leaf boss with its annoying all-cards-debuff-until-a-Joker-is-sold. The Big Blind is 75,000 chips, so I need to make some serious Multiplier moves.\n\nI've got $16 to work with, and a decent Joker lineup: a Green Joker with scaling Holo multipliers, Spare Trousers giving scaling Multiplier to Two Pair, Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome, x1.5, and crucial for that boss debuff), Constellation with its scaling Planet multiplier (x3.7), and the Blue Joker which adds chips.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Celestial Pack is *perfect*. It lets me instantly use a planet for Constellation. Constellation is the key here, scaling that multiplier up. $4, well spent. That pushes me to the first action.\n\nShould I buy any other cards? Hiker is too low impact at this point and Fortune Teller is good, but I don't want to sell something to give me the space, so it's a no. Standard Pack isn't great. Hone isn't worth it, and I'll save money for rerolls.\n\nNow, that Luchador ability... It says \"Sell this card to disable the current Boss Blind.\" The debuff disappears when I sell the card during the blind. I can sell it when the Verdant Leaf comes up. That's a good fail-safe, but I will try to avoid selling it unless I absolutely have to.\n\nSo, I will buy the Celestial Pack. Then, I need to find other Planets or Tarots later. Now, let's execute this play!\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
