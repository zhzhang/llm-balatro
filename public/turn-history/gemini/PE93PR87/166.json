{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis - Ante 6**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 6, with $43. The goal, as always, is to get through the blinds and win. My current setup is decent, but I'm hungry for more scaling, especially Planets for my `Constellation` Joker (x2.8 multiplier). I've got a good base going with a Holo Green Joker (+11 Mult), Spare Trousers (+14 Mult - conditional on Two Pair), Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome, x1.5), Constellation (x2.8 negative, but that's what I'm trying to mitigate!), and a Blue Joker (+122 Chips). I'm also holding `The Lovers` consumable, which is fine for now. I also have `Tarot Merchant` and `Grabber` Vouchers.\n\nThe shop presents a few choices: `Mime` for $5, `The Empress` for $3, and the `Wasteful` Voucher for $10.  `Wasteful` is a no-go. I need to get through the next blind and build my economy (interest). I have to figure out how to best use the Tarots and my cards to get the biggest score possible.\n\nMy immediate priority is Planets.  I need to get that multiplier up. I can use the reroll, but it's now at $7, and I've already rerolled twice.  Is it worth the risk? I'm torn.  I've been rerolling a lot and am specifically looking for planets.\n\nI have to carefully evaluate the current shop. `Mime` doesn't seem useful right now. `The Empress` *could* be good, especially given the `Tarot Merchant` voucher, but it doesn't give me what I need for scaling, and I'd need to play a hand to target. The best move is to proceed to the next round if I am satisfied with my deck.\n\nI think I'll buy `The Empress` for $3. It's a cheap way to increase scoring if I get stuck. But I'd rather keep my slot open in case I get a Spectral or Arcana pack that has a Planet in it. And spending more than I have to on rerolls, just to get a +0.1 increase, isn't worth it.\n\nSo, I think I'll hit the next round to build the money back up. It is probably the best move. My current hands are strong enough to beat the next blind.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
