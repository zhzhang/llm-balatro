{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 17. The primary objective is to maximize the score to beat the upcoming blinds, the Big Blind at 52.5k and the Boss at 70k, and finish Ante 8. I have $43 to work with.\n\nLooking at my Jokers, **Constellation** is the key. It's currently at X2.9 Mult, scaling with Planets. I need more Planets. **Mercury** is in the shop for $3, which is perfect because it's a Planet card and will level up Pair, AND trigger Constellation. This is the obvious first move, it's a no-brainer. After Mercury, I could buy Arcana Packs for more planets.\n\nSo, the action is to buy and use Mercury. Checking the API, it's a `buy_and_use_consumable` action and the shop index position of Mercury is 2. So the command will be `buy_and_use_consumable` and the position is [2]. Buying it will leave me with $40, which is enough to buy an Arcana pack or two if they are available. I don't need a target; Planet cards are used globally.\n\nI just went back and re-read all the shop info. Yup, position 2 is correct, Mercury is a Planet, and the action to buy and use it is correct.\nI'm confident that this is the highest value move given the current board state and my available resources. The increase in Constellation's multiplier will pay off immediately. Now, let's get Mercury!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
