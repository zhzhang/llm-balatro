{"reasoning":"**The Optimal Tarot Pack Choice**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. We're in Ante 3, Round 6, with $32 in the bank. Our goal, as always, is to maximize score and scaling. Right now, the primary scaling focus is Constellation, which loves Planet cards, and we also have Spare Trousers for Two Pair scaling. We have a solid Joker setup: Smiley Face for face cards, Mystic Summit for no discards, Spare Trousers, Luchador for boss disable, Constellation (negated but still impacting the hand), and Certificate for random sealed cards.\n\nThe Jumbo Arcana Pack gives us five choices, and I need to make a solid decision here:\n\n1.  **Death:** Could be useful for deck manipulation, maybe duplicating face cards for Smiley Face or that Blue Seal 7 of Diamonds, but is more situational.\n2.  **The High Priestess:** Creates up to two random Planet cards. This is a direct upgrade for Constellation – two planet cards are an immediate X0.2 multiplier increase and hand level improvements!\n3.  **The Magician:** Useful for Lucky Cards, but less reliable.\n4.  **The Hanged Man:** Can thin the deck, but deck thinning is not the immediate priority.\n5.  **The Wheel of Fortune:** High risk/reward. A joker upgrade is tempting, but a 25% chance isn't reliable.\n\nConsidering the existing strategy, the \"High Priestess\" looks like the best bet. It guarantees planet card generation, which is exactly what we need for Constellation. This is the most consistent scaling option and I can put the planets in my consumable slots. The Blue Seal 7 of Diamonds in the hand also creates a planet card, so it is guaranteed scaling.\n\nLet's double-check the logic. The High Priestess will produce two planets, which will trigger Constellation twice. That's a solid X0.2 multiplier increase. Other options are less direct and/or less reliable. We have 0/2 consumables, so we have plenty of space. Wheel of Fortune is only 25%, and Death is more situational.\n\nI'm confident. **I'll select Choice 2: The High Priestess.** The command is `select 2`. And here is my final thought: select 2.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
