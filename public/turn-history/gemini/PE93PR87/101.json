{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Moves**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 4/8, Round 10. Time to make some strategic decisions. I've got $39 to work with in this SHOP phase. My current Joker setup is pretty interesting: the Green Joker (that Holo version is nice), Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, the Certificate (always a wildcard), Luchador, and Constellation. The Constellation joker is negative, which is normally bad, but it also has a secondary effect that gives me an additional Joker slot, so I'm at the full 6 Jokers.\n\nMy hand levels are decent, but they can always be better; Pair is at level 5, Three of a Kind at 4, Full House at 4, and Two Pair at only level 1. I need to focus on scaling the Constellation joker, which multiplies my score, and improving those hand levels.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Supernova joker seems weak relative to what I've already got with the Green Joker and Spare Trousers. The Chariot is tempting, the Steel card enhancement could be useful. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is a must-buy as it offers Planets, which directly scale Constellation, and the Spectral Pack also seems worth a look; it's high-risk, high-reward.\n\nWith $39, I can comfortably afford both packs. I will buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack and the Spectral Pack. I can also afford the Chariot consumable, as I currently have no consumables.\n\nMy primary goal here is to get Constellation scaling up, which is at x2.1 Mult right now. The Jumbo Celestial Pack directly helps with that by offering Planets. I'll buy and use that pack immediately. I'm also hoping the Spectral Pack will hold something useful. Let's see what's in there. I have all the money I need to acquire everything, so let's start with the Celestial Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
