{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Navigation**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 3, Round 6, in the shop phase. I've got $27, which is currently giving me maximum interest of $5. My primary goal is to maximize my scaling engine, especially Constellation (X1.8 multiplier, scales with Planets). Mystic Summit (+15 Mult at 0 discards), Smiley Face (+5 Mult for faces), and Spare Trousers (+2 Mult for Two Pair) provide flat and scaling Mult. Luchador gives X1.5 and disables bosses, and Certificate adds a card. I've got a decent lineup, but I'm always looking to optimize.\n\nThe shop itself offers some interesting options, but nothing is immediately game-changing. I could buy Wily or Sly Joker, but I'd need to sell one of my current Jokers. Selling Smiley Face or Spare Trousers (+2) for a Wily Joker (+100 Chips) is tempting for immediate points, but I'm prioritizing Planets for Constellation. I can also buy a standard pack, but the value is pretty low in general. The Wasteful Voucher is immediately out – extra discards hurt Mystic Summit. Rerolling is available, but that costs $6, dropping my interest below the max.\n\nThe math points to a simple strategy. Rerolling ($6) would leave me at $21, losing $1 of interest. I want to keep at least $25 for the max $5 interest. I have to decide if it's worth it. Given the lack of Planets in the shop, I think I'm better off moving to the next round, building up my money, and seeing what the next shop brings. I can always check `round_select` to verify.\n\nWait. Let me double-check something. I have to determine if Spare Trousers scales with Full Houses. The rules say that a full house *contains* a Two Pair. *This is huge*! If I play Full Houses (my best hand), Spare Trousers scales! This is great.\n\nOkay, let's look at the available actions. I don't know the next blind, so I have to click `round_select`.\n\nGiven that I have $27, I could buy the Standard Pack ($4), but then I would have $23 and lose on interest. Certificate already adds cards.\n\nI think it's time to move to `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
