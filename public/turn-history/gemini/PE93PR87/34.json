{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Few Rounds**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 3/8, Round 4, $22 in the bank after using Temperance. Let's see... I've got Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, Constellation (the pesky negative one, but it gives me an extra joker slot, which is crucial), and Certificate. Six total slots, maxed out. No consumables, which isn't ideal, but manageable.\n\nThe shop is offering a Half Joker, Spare Trousers, a Standard Pack, and, most importantly, the Hieroglyph voucher. The Hieroglyph immediately catches my eye. Reducing the Ante by 1 is *massive* early game. More rounds mean more money, more shops, and more time to build my deck with Certificate and find those sweet Planet cards for Constellation. Yes, it costs me a hand, but I'm usually crushing these rounds in one or two hands anyway. That's fine.\n\nMy current focus is on Full Houses – that's where the high scores have been. The Spare Trousers, which scales with Two Pair, is a perfect fit. Since Full Houses *always* contain a Two Pair, it'll be scaling every time I play a Full House. I can slot this into my sixth slot.\n\nThe Standard Pack is just good general deck-building material – useful for finding more face cards to synergize with Smiley Face.\n\nSo, the play here is clear. The Hieroglyph voucher costs $10, which leaves me with $12. Spare Trousers cost $6, leaving $6. Standard pack costs $4. Buying the Hieroglyph is non-negotiable; its scaling effect is what I need. Spare Trousers are excellent for this deck build. I should check if I can afford it. Yes, I can; Constellation gives me an additional slot, so I'm not over the limit. Buying the Standard Pack is also good for building the deck.\n\nThe Hieroglyph voucher is the most impactful move here. Let's buy that.\nAction: `buy_voucher`, positions: [1]\nReasoning: Hieroglyph resets the Ante, allowing for more time to scale the deck. I can afford it.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
