{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Steps**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 7/8, Round 18, and it's SHOP time. I've got $30 left after purchasing an Arcana pack. My primary goal is to maximize my score and get ready for the final Ante. I have a solid setup, with a focus on Constellation as my main scaling engine; it's currently at x3.4 and scales with planets. I've already used Pluto and Mercury, so more planets are key.\n\nLet's break down the shop and my options. Right now, I'm sitting on:\n\n*   **Money:** $30\n*   **Jokers:** Green Joker (+23 Mult), Spare Trousers (+18 Mult), Certificate (adds seals), Luchador (x1.5, boss insurance), Constellation (x3.4), Blue Joker (+126 Chips)\n*   **Consumables:** Judgement (unusable with 6/6 Jokers)\n\nThe shop is offering: a Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards, not that useful right now), and a Mega Standard Pack.\n\nNow, I bought the Arcana pack. The immediate priority is to hunt for more Planet cards or Tarot cards that can make Planet cards. I'm going to want to purchase more Arcana Packs.\n\nI considered selling Blue Joker to use Judgement, but Blue Joker's 126 chips is quite good. I'll pass on that for now.\n\nSo, the action is done, and my money is down. Time to move on and see what the next blind has in store.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
