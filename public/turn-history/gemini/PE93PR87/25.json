{"reasoning":"**Current Round Strategy: The Pillar**\n\nOkay, so we're in Ante 2, Round 3, and it's time to tackle The Pillar blind. The challenge? Debuffed cards from previous plays this ante. I need 1600 chips to clear this round. Money is tight, just $1 in the bank! I'm holding a decent hand, and the board has a two pair.\n\nMy hand is: Smiley Face (additive mult), Mystic Summit (additive mult), Luchador (Polychrome, X1.5 mult), Constellation (Negative, X1.1 mult), and Certificate (adds a card at the start of the round). I also only have the Boss Blind to deal with this Ante.\n\nLuchador can be sold to negate The Pillar's effect, but it's *way* more useful to keep that juicy x1.5 multiplier. I only played a Two Pair in the Small Blind, so I can try to minimize debuffs by avoiding those cards.\n\nLet's quickly run a Joker check. Order is crucial. Smiley Face and Mystic Summit add to the base score, while Luchador and Constellation are multipliers. My current order (Smiley, Mystic, Luchador, Constellation, Certificate) is *perfect*. Additive comes before Multiplicative, and Certificate's position doesn't matter since it triggers at the start.\n\nThe only real question is: sell Luchador or play? Selling disables the debuff, but losing the x1.5 Multi would be a gamble. With most of my deck unaffected, I'm confident I can make this work. The goal is 1600 chips, and I need that multiplier.\n\nTherefore: No rearrange, no sell, just play the round. Here we go.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
