{"reasoning":"**The Constellation build is calling for the Meteor Tag!**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, round 14. We're in the Blind Select phase, and the Small Blind is 20,000 chips. I have a Meteor Tag (Mega Celestial Pack) available if I skip. Money isn't an issue, and I'm sitting on a solid collection of Jokers: Green (+10 mult), Spare Trousers (+12 for Two Pair), Certificate (adds a card), Luchador (x1.5, Polychrome), Constellation (x2.4, Negative), and Blue Joker (+120 chips). Consumables are The Lovers (Wild card) and Strength (+1 rank), but I can't use them now in this phase. My hand levels are already pretty good: Three of a Kind Level 7, Pair Level 5, Full House Level 4, and Two Pair Level 1.\n\nThe Green Joker and Spare Trousers will be happy if I get more hands to scale their bonuses. Certificate builds the deck. Constellation is the star here; it *loves* Planet cards. The Blue Joker just dumps chips, and that's always welcome.\n\nThe Small Blind is 20,000, and the Big Blind is 30,000, with the Boss (The Mark) requiring 40,000.  The Luchador is a good counter for the Boss, as it disables the \"all face cards are drawn face down\" condition.\n\nI have two options: Play the Small Blind for $3 and a chance at the shop, but that delays the scaling of Constellation, *or* I can skip for the Meteor Tag and get a guaranteed Mega Celestial Pack (2 Planets). A shop might have Planets, but it's not guaranteed. The Meteor Tag is guaranteed value for the Constellation build, and I want those planets, *badly*.\n\nMy Constellation is at x2.4 right now, and the Meteor Tag will boost that even further, plus level up my hands. Skipping for a guaranteed Mega Celestial Pack is a very solid play, especially with Constellation.\n\nOkay, checking the Boss blind again. The Luchador can neutralize the \"face down\" effect. I can comfortably reach the blind score with my current setup.\n\nI am deciding to skip for the Meteor Tag. It's the optimal play for the long game because it scales Constellation and hand levels.\n\nWait, skipping means I move directly to the Big Blind select phase. I'm skipping the Small Blind shop but *immediately* get the choice to shop after the Big Blind! The value for Constellation is very high, even given the shop access from the next Blind.\n\nIt's a definite skip.\n\nOkay, let's review the Joker order. My order, from top to bottom, is: Green Joker (+10), Spare Trousers (+12), Certificate, Luchador (x1.5, Polychrome), Constellation (x2.4), and Blue Joker (+120). This ordering works! I *must* have my additive mult jokers (Green/Trousers) before my multiplicative mult (Luchador/Constellation). The Blue Joker adds chips *before* the mult is applied, so its position doesn't directly influence the mult calculation. The order is ideal.\n\nSo, the action is `skip_round`. The Meteor Tag is a direct ticket to Constellation scaling.\n\nAnd, just to be sure, I can't use consumables right now, as I don't see my hand in the current phase.\n\nI'm ready to execute `skip_round`. The Meteor Tag is the play.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
