{"reasoning":"**My Strategy for Scaling to Ante 8**\n\nAlright, let's assess the situation. I'm at Ante 7, Round 16, post-Big Blind, pre-Boss Blind, with $50. The ultimate goal is to reach Ante 8. I've got a decent Joker setup: Green Joker (potentially +22 Multi), Spare Trousers (+16 Multi), Certificate, Luchador (X1.5 Mult), Constellation (X2.9 Multi, negative), and a Blue Joker (+120 chips). I've also got The Lovers consumable (1/2), and Tarot Merchant, Grabber, and Hieroglyph vouchers.\n\nThe key to this build is the Constellation Joker. It scales with Planet cards. I currently have one Blue Seal card, the 7 of Diamonds. My priority is to maximize Constellation's scaling.\n\nThe Standard Pack Choices are:\n1.  Queen of Spades (Foil, +50 chips)\n2.  King of Clubs (Blue Seal)\n3.  Queen of Spades (Standard)\n\nThe Queen of Spades (Foil) is tempting for the +50 chips, but the Blue Joker already gives me +120 chips, so that's not as critical. The Queen of Spades (Standard) is a no-go. The King of Clubs, however, is a Blue Seal card, and that's exactly what I need. More Blue Seals mean more consistent Planet generation, which fuels Constellation's multiplier.\n\nThe optimal strategy here is clear: acquire the King of Clubs to build the engine for Constellation. This is the only choice that actively supports the build and its scaling.\n\nBefore making my selection, I double-checked the Joker order – Green, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation (Additives then Multiplicatives). The order's right, and the Blue Seal is the priority for the long-term scaling I need.\n\nSo, I'll select the King of Clubs, which is at position 2 in the Pack Choices.\n\nCommand: `select 2`\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
