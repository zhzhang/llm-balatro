{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Moves**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop phase, post-Celestial Pack, with $38 in the bank. My immediate goal is to maximize my score to clear Ante 8. I have a decent base setup: Green Joker (Holo, +10 Mult), Mystic Summit (+15 Mult), Spare Trousers (+2 Mult, scaling on Two Pair), Certificate (adds a random card), Luchador (Polychrome, x1.5 Mult, sell to disable Boss), and most importantly, Constellation (Negative, x2.1 Mult, scaling with Planet cards). I'm also holding Grabber (+1 hand) and Hieroglyph (-1 Ante, -1 hand). My hand levels are decent: Pair (Lv 5), Full House (Lv 4), and Three of a Kind (Lv 4).\n\nGiven my resources, I have three solid options in the shop: Mail-In Rebate ($4 - not useful right now), Wheel of Fortune ($3), and an Arcana Pack ($4). My scaling relies on Constellation (Planet cards), Spare Trousers (Two Pair), and the Green Joker (hands played). My economy is healthy enough to support some calculated risks, but I want to keep fueling Constellation.\n\nThe initial instinct is to buy an Arcana Pack to potentially get Planet cards, but the Wheel of Fortune is also tempting with a 1 in 4 chance of getting a Joker edition. Given the cheap cost, the Wheel of Fortune is appealing.\n\nConsidering the previous thought process, I had planned to grab Grabber, a Celestial Pack, then *potentially* an Arcana Pack followed by a Wheel of Fortune. The Grabber and Celestial Pack are done, so the next step is the Arcana Pack.\n\nTherefore, the action is `buy_booster 1` (Arcana Pack).\n\nBefore I make the purchase, I need to confirm the Joker positions. Right now they are positioned correctly with additive Jokers on the left and multiplicative Jokers on the right, which is the correct way to set this up for optimization.\n\nSo, the play is to buy the Arcana Pack first.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
