{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Balatro Run**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 4, shop phase. Got $34. The goal is still to reach and beat Ante 8. I'm running a Two Pair strategy with scaling from Spare Trousers and hoping Constellation works out with Planets. I just used a Jumbo Celestial Pack and got Venus, so Three of a Kind is Level 6 and Constellation is at x2.3.\n\nI need to balance spending with keeping enough for interest - ideally $25. The Arcana Pack is only $4, which is safe, leaving $30.\n\nThe shop has Acrobat ($6, x3 on final hand), Onyx Agate ($7, +7 mult per Club), and the Arcana Pack ($4). My current jokers are a solid mix: Green Joker (+16), Mystic Summit (+15 mult if no discards), Spare Trousers (+8 mult scaling), Certificate (free card at round start), Luchador (x1.5 polychrome, Boss skip), and Constellation (x2.3 scaling).\n\nI'm thinking about Acrobat. It's powerful, x3 on the final hand. But my strategy relies on winning early and often, so Acrobat might not be ideal. I have no empty slots (5 used, 1 negative), but I was confused about how the negative joker (Constellation) factors into slot count. I have 6 Jokers and the \"Max Jokers\" display says 6. My understanding is that the negative edition joker takes 0 slots, hence I should be able to hold 6 Jokers with a Negative, which seems correct.\n\nOnyx Agate is tempting, but not better than what I have. I could sell Mystic Summit for Acrobat, but I'm hesitant to lose the +15 mult, especially if I have 0 discards. Acrobat is strong, but for now, I'll stick with what I have.\n\nThe Arcana Pack is looking like the best option. Tarot cards could give me money, or cards that fix my deck like a Strength or Death for my Two Pair strategy. I have to remember \"buy_booster\" for boosters and \"buy_and_use_consumable\" for the cards on the card selection screen.\n\nI'm checking if there's anything else. I still have $34, and can reroll for Planets if I wanted to, but the Arcana Pack is a more compelling first option. I don't need to sell Luchador - the x1.5 polychrome and the Boss skip is great. Certificate and Green Joker are great, too. Spare Trousers scales, so I'll keep that. The decision is made, buy the Arcana Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
