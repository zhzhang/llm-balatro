{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action - Ante 7, Round 18**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 7, Round 18, $22 in the bank. Shop's up. The goal is to maximize score, especially for the upcoming boss and for Ante 8.\n\nMy current powerhouses are: Constellation (x3.5 mult, negative so doesn't take a slot) and Luchador (x1.5 polychrome, boss disable). Additive mult comes from Green Joker (+13, Holo +10), Spare Trousers (+18). Blue Joker gives a hefty +130 chips.\n\nThe *current* shop is showing a \"Smiley Face\" (+5 mult for face cards). Seems marginal given my already decent additive mult. The Blue Joker's chip bonus or the existing additive mult jokers are much stronger. Plus, I'm maxed out on Joker slots. Selling one to get it? Nah.\n\nI've got a Blue Seal card in my deck which will generate a planet at the end of the round; awesome! I need to scale Constellation.\n\nNow, I also have a Judgement consumable. I could use it... *if* I sell a Joker. Blue Joker's chips are tempting to keep, but it's a *lot* of chips! Green Joker gives +23 in mult. Trousers is +18.\n\nHere's my Joker line-up in order, for efficient triggering:\n\n1.  Green Joker (Additive mult)\n2.  Spare Trousers (Additive mult)\n3.  Certificate (Utility)\n4.  Luchador (Multiplicative)\n5.  Constellation (Multiplicative)\n6.  Blue Joker (Chips)\n\nOkay, the order seems optimized, with additive mult building before multipliers kick in. My money is at $22.\n\nGiven the *lack* of planets in this shop, I need to reroll. I have enough money, $5, to reroll and keep my options open.\n\nRerolling is the play.\n\nAnd one more thing. I should examine the \"Luchador\" description carefully - it looks bloated. I suspect a UI bug. The *core* effect is known: It's the Polychrome edition (x1.5).\n\nReroll, here we go!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
