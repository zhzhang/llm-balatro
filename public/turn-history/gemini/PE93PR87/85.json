{"reasoning":"**Strategic Blind Assault: The Eye**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Blind Select screen for The Eye. This is Ante 3/8, round 8. I need to hit 4000 chips. \"The Eye\" Boss Blind is active, meaning I can't repeat hand types. I've got $37, so I'm not really worried about interest at this point.\n\nI have a solid Joker setup. Green Joker, Mystic Summit (crucial with no discards), Spare Trousers (potential for a Two Pair boost), Certificate (for a random card), Luchador (a polychrome multiplier, which is tempting to sell but strong), and Constellation (another big multiplier with a downside of -1 slot, but I'll make it work). I've got a Devil and Chariot consumable, but I have to wait to play them since I'm in Blind Select and the round has not started.\n\nI'm in the BLIND_SELECT state. The available actions are `play_round`, `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, and `sell_joker`. My previous attempt was to use a consumable from the shop, which failed. The action I want is to start the round.\n\nI need to decide how to approach this. Selling Luchador would disable the blind, but its x1.5 multiplier is huge, so I should be able to get 4000 without doing that, and that's the best option here.\n\nThe key is to minimize discards. Mystic Summit gives +15 Mult for no discards. I can rearrange Jokers later if needed. The current order looks good. I have (Base + 11 + 15 + 2) * 1.5 * 1.9 for a very high mult.\n\nLet's do some quick math. My Pair is Lv 4, base 55/5. My current multiplier is 33 (5 + 11 + 2 + 15). The polychrome from Luchador x1.5 is great, and Constellation x1.9 is another multiplier. I should be able to hit 4000 easily with a Pair, even without perfect cards.\n\n(55 (from the Pair) + 20) * 33 * 1.5 * 1.9 = roughly 7000. So I can beat this blind with a single hand.\n\nMy plan is simple: I'll use `play_round`. Let's hit it.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
