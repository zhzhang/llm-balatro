{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Buying Spare Trousers**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. I'm in Ante 2, Round 4. My money's at $12. I've got a decent Joker setup: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, Constellation (that pesky negative one, but it gives me an extra slot!), and a Certificate. I’m currently building around Full Houses, and I've got an immediate opportunity to scale: Spare Trousers. This is a no-brainer.\n\nI have $12, Spare Trousers costs $6. That leaves me with $6, which can either go towards a Standard Pack or generate interest. I'll pass on the Half Joker since it's geared towards hands with three cards or less.\n\nSpare Trousers provides a flat +2 Mult *for every* Two Pair in the hand. And a Full House, by definition, contains a Two Pair (plus a three-of-a-kind). So, buying Spare Trousers *will* be a great addition to my build. I've got one open Joker slot.\n\nI know I’ll have to format the output as JSON, and I need to buy Spare Trousers. Now the correct JSON format is `{\"action\": \"buy_card\", \"positions\": [2]}` since Spare Trousers is in position 2 in the shop. I need to make sure I get the positions right.\n\nThe schema expects: `action`, `positions`, `intended_hand_type`, and `estimated_chips`. No estimated chips or hand type for this move.\n\nThe ideal buy order is: buy Spare Trousers. I'll be in good shape after this. And this is the immediate priority. I'll re-evaluate the shop after this purchase. I should be able to get another joker soon!\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, a Full House *does* contain a Two Pair.\n\nSo, I'm buying Spare Trousers. Final JSON: `{\"action\": \"buy_card\", \"positions\": [2]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
