{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Decision - Ante 4**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 4, and I've got $9. Last hand I played a Full House for a massive 8,045 chips, so I'm riding that wave. The goal, as always, is to keep winning. Currently, I'm running Full Houses with Jokers: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, Constellation (which is negative, but has 1.1x multiplier currently), and Certificate. Constellation scales with Planet cards. I can hold 6 Jokers, but only 5 total, one of which is negative.\n\nIn the shop, I've got a Half Joker (useless for my Full House strategy), Spare Trousers (a Two Pair scaling joker which *does* work with Full House play), a Standard Pack, an Arcana Pack, and a pricey Hieroglyph voucher. Reroll is $5.\n\nI'm leaning towards deck manipulation or scaling up Constellation. Arcana Packs have a shot at The High Priestess, which gives 2 Planet cards – that would trigger Constellation for an extra 0.2x multiplier. The Standard Pack might add a useful card like a King or Ace, which my Smiley Face and Mystic Summit Jokers benefit from.\n\nGiven the options, I initially thought Arcana Pack ($4) is a must, and maybe a Standard Pack, but I need to save. I want to save for interest if possible, but improving the deck/scaling Constellation is important. Constellation scales with *Planet* cards, not Tarot, but Arcana packs sometimes offer Planet cards (The High Priestess) or ways to get money/improve the deck. *Self-correction*: Constellation gains X0.1 per Planet card. I haven't used any yet. Wait, description says \"Currently X1.1 Mult\", so one planet was used.\n\nI think I was right the first time. The Arcana Pack is the play. It might provide \"The High Priestess\" which would trigger Constellation.\n\nHere’s the plan: Buy Arcana Pack ($4), leaving me with $5. That'll earn $1 interest.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** Buy Arcana Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
