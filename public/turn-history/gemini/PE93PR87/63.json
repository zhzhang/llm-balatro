{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Maximizing Score & Scaling**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop after picking \"The High Priestess\" from a Jumbo Arcana Pack. My immediate goal is to maximize score potential and scaling. I've got a decent Joker setup: Smiley Face (Face card mult), Mystic Summit (discard bonus), Spare Trousers (Two Pair mult), Luchador (Polychrome mult), Constellation (Planet card scaling), and Certificate (deck manipulation). I also have two consumables: Earth (Full House level up) and Venus (Three of a Kind level up). And I have $32.\n\nThe key right now is Constellation. It’s sitting at X1.6, gaining +0.1 Mult for every Planet card I use. Earth and Venus are key here. I need to make space in my consumable slots for potential future ones.\n\nI've got a few options in the shop: Splash (Foil), Lusty Joker, a Standard Pack, Wasteful, and Reroll. Splash looks interesting, but I'd need to sell a Joker. Wasteful goes against my Mystic Summit strategy. Standard Pack isn't a high priority unless I want to manipulate my deck more with the Certificate.\n\nSo, the plan: First, I'm using \"Earth\" (Position 1) to level up my Full House to level 4. This also helps with Constellation scaling. Then I’ll use \"Venus\" (Position 2), to level up my Three of a Kind to Level 3.\n\nI’m rich enough to afford most things. I need to use the planets in my deck. With $32, I can afford to use the Earth and Venus. Constellation will be X1.8 after I use them both.\n\nAction: `use_consumable`\nPosition: 1 (Earth).\nTarget: None needed for Planet cards.\n\nAfter checking for more actions, there is not anything more to do but use the consumable.\n\nFinal Action: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
