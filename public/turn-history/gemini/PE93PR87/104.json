{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Spectral Pack: A Strategic Crossroads**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4, Round 10, facing the SPECTRAL_PACK step. $29 in the bank, six Jokers in play: Green Joker (hand size scaling), Mystic Summit (discard scaling), Spare Trousers (Two Pair scaling), Certificate, Luchador (boss disable), and Constellation (Planet scaling). My hand is a mixed bag, but it includes that Steel 9 of Diamonds with the Blue Seal – very important. I also have the Gold 2 of Diamonds.\n\nThe pack choices are Talisman (add Gold Seal to a card) and Ouija (converts hand to a single random rank, -1 hand size). Talisman is safe money, while Ouija is a high-risk, high-reward proposition. I'm currently leaning towards Three of a Kind, Pairs, and Full Houses, with an eye towards Four/Five of a Kind down the line. I want to build a scaling deck.\n\nThe Ouija option looks tempting as it would provide a Five of a Kind hand immediately, but the -1 hand size is a huge drawback, especially since I need to retain the Blue Seal on the 9 of Diamonds for Constellation scaling. I usually avoid this kind of strategy with a penalty. Talisman looks like a safe pick.\n\nI'm thinking Talisman. I could put the Gold Seal on the Ace of Clubs to give economy, but the 9 of Diamonds with Blue Seal is *extremely* valuable for Constellation. If I play the 9 of Diamonds, it creates a planet card. That is worth much more than the economy of the Gold Seal.\n\nWait, if I use Ouija *now*, I have 8 cards of the same rank in my deck for the rest of the run, making Four/Five of a Kind much easier to draw. But the Blue Seal is a much more effective strategy for me to take. I have a lot of scaling that synergizes much better with that card.\n\nI will choose Talisman. If I pick Talisman, I should put the Gold Seal on a card I *want* to play. The Ace of Clubs is a good candidate. But wait!\n\nThe Queen of Spades (Position 1) is a good target. It's a face card, scores well.\n\n**Action:** Select Talisman and apply it to the Queen of Spades. I can use the Queen of Spades now with the Gold Seal on it.\n\nOkay, let's re-read the Blue Seal card (9 of Diamonds). It's a Steel Card. If I put a Gold Seal on a card I play, I get money. If I keep the Steel card in hand, I get mult.\n\nI'll put the Gold Seal on the Queen of Spades (1).\n\n*Wait!* I just noticed the Luchador description is very buggy in the provided text (lots of repeated text). But I know what Luchador does: Sell to disable boss blind. It also has Polychrome (X1.5).\n\nAction: select\nPositions: [1, 1]\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1]"}
