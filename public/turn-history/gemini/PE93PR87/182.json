{"reasoning":"**Round 16: Tactical Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 7/8, $29 in the bank, and the next blind is the Small Blind at 35,000 chips. I have a decent hand with some scaling potential. The current blind select is for a Voucher Tag which isn't awful but it's not the priority. I have a plan:\n\nMy inventory is pretty solid: I have a Green Joker with +22 Multi (12 base + 10 holo) that scales per hand, Spare Trousers with +16 Multi that scales with Two Pairs, a Certificate, Luchador (X1.5 mult and can disable the boss), a Constellation at X2.9 Multi, and a Blue Joker with +122 Chips. I also have \"The Lovers\" consumable, but it's only useful in the round. I'm sitting at 6/6 Joker slots, which is good but means I need to be strategic. Vouchers in the wings: Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Grabber, Hieroglyph.\n\n*   **Reroll Boss?** The Mark (debuffs face cards) is the Boss. No, Luchador is a good counter. No need to spend the $10 reroll.\n*   **Sell Jokers or Consumables?** Absolutely not. Space is tight, but I want to keep everything. Selling the consumable is negligible.\n*   **Play Round vs. Skip?** Playing this round is looking like the best option. I can get some immediate cash. If I play the round, I get $3 base, interest (~$5), and hand bonuses (~$3-4) – so a solid $40 or so. This also lets me scale Green Joker and Spare Trousers. Each hand adds +1 to Green Joker and each Two Pair adds +2 to Spare Trousers. This is huge for the long term. I'm *very* interested in hitting a shop after this, given my Constellation and its potential to scale with Planets. Skipping gives me a Voucher Tag for the next shop (if I can get there!), but no immediate benefit.\n\nLet's do some quick math. Base Multi is approximately 22 (Green) + 16 (Trousers) = 38. Total Multiplier is roughly 38 * 1.5 * 2.9 = 165.3. With a Two Pair (40 chips, +3 mult) and 122 chips, I'm looking at ~(122 + 40) * (3 + 38) * 1.5 * 2.9 = ~28,892 chips. I can easily hit 35,000.\n\nI think the best course of action is to **play the round**. This will scale my jokers, get me money, and most importantly, allow me to access the shop. The goal is to find Planet cards for Constellation.\n\n*   **Joker Order:** Chips -> Additive Mult -> Multiplicative Mult. No real changes needed. The current order is fine. The game logic follows the right sequence: Blue Joker (Chips) -> Green Joker (+Mult) -> Spare Trousers (+Mult) -> Luchador (X1.5) -> Constellation (X2.9).\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
