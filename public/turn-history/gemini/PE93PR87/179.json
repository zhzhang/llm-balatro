{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Action Planning**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Shop phase, Ante 7/8, Round 16. I've got $40, a solid Joker lineup with potential, and a burning desire to maximize my score for Ante 8. My current Jokers are: Green Joker (+12 mult, +10 holo), Spare Trousers (+16 mult), Certificate, Luchador (X1.5, boss disable), Constellation (X2.9), and Blue Joker (+122 chips). I'm at 6/6 Joker slots, which is a good position. Consumables: The Lovers (1/2), and a good collection of Vouchers (Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Grabber, Hieroglyph).\n\nThe immediate concern is Ante 8. Constellation is my primary scaling engine, and it needs Planet cards to really take off. I've got a single \"Scary Face\" in the shop for sale, which isn't tempting enough to sell any of my current Jokers. I also see no boosters and no other Vouchers to buy.\n\nLet's quickly rule out other moves. Using or selling \"The Lovers\" is impossible or unwise as I currently have no cards in hand. My Joker lineup is efficient, so I'm not going to sell one off. I can't buy any cards because I'm full on Jokers and the \"Scary Face\" isn't what I need.\n\nMy current money: $40. My interest caps at $25. Rerolling the shop to hunt for Planet cards is the most logical move. Rerolls cost $5, so I can afford to reroll up to three times (15 dollars) to give myself the highest chance. This will leave me at $35.\n\nI need to make the move: `reroll_shop`. I need to ensure the JSON is valid, according to requirements. Only the \"action\" field is mandatory.\n\nHere is the JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
