{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Blind Select**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 4, Round 11, Boss Blind \"The Window,\" which means diamond cards are debuffed. I need 10,000 chips. I've got $25 in my wallet.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid: a Green Joker with a holo, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, a Certificate, Luchador (the polychrome one - thank goodness), and Constellation. The debuff on Diamonds is a mild inconvenience. I can make an easy 10,000 chips, no sweat.\n\nGiven the boss blind, and that I've only got one diamond card in my hand at most, I don't think that I need to sell Luchador to disable the boss blind. It does give 1.5x mult which will be beneficial. I can easily surpass 10,000 chips with my current setup.\n\nI have a Three of a Kind at Level 6, and I'll keep the polychrome multiplier on Luchador. Let's do the math. (13 base mult + 39 from Jokers) * 2.3 * 1.5 = ~179 mult total. Then I can just use my Three of a Kind, which should be roughly 23,322 chips. Easy.\n\nNow, let's make sure the Joker order is correct. Additive first (+Mult), then Multiplicative (XMult). The current order is perfect: Green Joker (+16), Mystic Summit (+15), Spare Trousers (+8), Certificate, Luchador (X1.5), and Constellation (X2.3). Looks good.\n\nNow, the important part: What can I do? I'm in BLIND_SELECT. According to the prompt, the available commands are `play_round`, `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, and `sell_joker`. Nothing to do but start the round. My move is `play_round`. Easy win.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
