{"reasoning":"**Focusing on the Final Boss**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 21, the Verdant Leaf boss is up next, and I'm looking at a STANDARD_PACK. I've got $7, six Jokers (including the key one, Luchador, to counter the debuff), and some pretty solid hand levels: Pair at Lvl 10, Three of a Kind at Lvl 11, and Two Pair at Lvl 4. The Verdant Leaf boss debuffs all cards until I sell a Joker.\n\nThe most important thing right now is that I need to reach 100k chips to beat the boss, so I need to focus on maximizing my score on the next hand, even with the debuff. The current hand is debuffed. Luchador is the key: Sell him to remove the debuff. Constellation has x4.0 mult if I'm lucky with Planets, and the Steel 2 of Hearts has a x1.5 mult if held in hand, and this is far more valuable than the other cards.\n\nMy immediate action is to grab the Steel 2 of Hearts (Position 1 in the pack). It's got the Blue Seal, and it creates a Planet, but the Steel is more important, it has a x1.5 mult while held in hand, which is crucial for maximizing my score. This is a no-brainer with a multiplier like that! I'm currently using Pair or Three of a Kind, so getting the Steel card in hand will be a massive boost. This is far better than the Wild card or the Lucky card.\n\nSo, the action is `select` and the positions are `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
