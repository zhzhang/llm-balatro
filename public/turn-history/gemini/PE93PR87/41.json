{"reasoning":"**Strategic Discard: Maximizing Two Pair and Mult**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 2/8, Round 5, big blind. I've got a $6 bankroll, need to hit 1200 chips, and I have three hands left with three discards. I'm holding a hand with a couple of useful Jokers: Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Mystic Summit (+15 Mult at 0 discards), Spare Trousers (+2 Mult scaling for Two Pair), Luchador (disable boss), Constellation (X0.1 Mult per planet), and Certificate (adds card with seal). I'm also sporting an active Investment Tag which is going to be nice after the boss is taken care of.\n\nMy current hand: Jh, Qc, 7c, 5c, 4c, 9d, 8d (Red Seal - retrigger), 7d (Blue Seal - planet if held). The Investment Tag is good for later.\n\nThe immediate goal is to scale Spare Trousers, so a Two Pair is what I'm aiming for. I have a pair of 7s and a hand with face cards (Jack, Queen, Red Seal 8). Mystic Summit is locked in, as I have to go to 0 discards. Plus, I want to be *very* careful with that Blue Seal 7d. I need to keep it in my hand until the final play to get that sweet Constellation bonus. I have to use *all* discards to trigger Mystic Summit. So, I need to discard cards to get to zero discards.\n\nLet's break down the cards. I've got two 7s (7c, 7d), face cards (Jh, Qc), and some junk (5c, 4c, 9d). I can discard up to 5 cards, but I only have 3 discards left. The best play is to get rid of the junk cards, while hoping to find a pair for the 7s (7c and 7d).\n\nSo, the plan is to discard 5c, 4c, and 9d (Positions 4, 5, 6) in order to get to zero discards.\n\nHere's the refined breakdown: I need to discard the non-pair, non-face cards and get the Mult from Mystic Summit. So discard: 4, 5, 6. Let's see what happens.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"discard\",\n  \"positions\": [4, 5, 6]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,5,6]"}
