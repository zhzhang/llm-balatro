{"reasoning":"**Celestial Pack Decision: Venus it is!**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` step after snagging a Celestial Pack. My primary objective here is to activate that juicy `Constellation` Joker for a +X0.1 multiplier. Any planet card will do the trick, but I want to be *smart* about it. Let's see... the options are Neptune (Straight Flush), Uranus (Two Pair), and Venus (Three of a Kind).\n\nInitially, I was leaning towards Venus because it levels up Three of a Kind, which is a common fallback, and that gives +2 Mult. It feels like the best balance of utility and the immediate constellation boost. I noted that I have to check my hand history to see if any hands have been played. Oh yeah! I have played Full House twice. Full house involves three of a kind. This makes me want to re-evaluate. \n\nSo, I re-assessed the three options:\n*   Neptune (Straight Flush): +4 Mult, but rare.\n*   Uranus (Two Pair): +1 Mult, common, but not the best.\n*   Venus (Three of a Kind): +2 Mult, common.\n\nWhile I could go for the big multiplier with Neptune, that's not reliable. Venus is the solid choice: good scaling, decent chance of playing the hand. It makes the most sense.\n\nSo I need to format my `action`. The format I've seen before is: `action`: \"select\" and the relevant `positions`. I can just run it!\n\n**Action:** `select 3` which is Venus.\n\nNow, let's see, what should the final format look like?\n\nOkay, the schema specifies:\n*   `action`: \"select\"\n*   `positions`: \\[3]\n*   `intended_hand_type`: null (it's a shop action, so no specific hand in mind)\n*   `estimated_chips`: null\n\nYup, that's the correct format. Just checking the Joker order again: Additive comes before Multiplicative. Smiley Face and Mystic Summit add multipliers. Perfect. The planet card, in any case, is just to trigger constellation.\n\nAlright, final check: Is there a compelling reason to pick Uranus instead? Not really. Venus provides better long-term utility.\n\n**Final Action:** `select 3` which is Venus. This gets us:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
