{"reasoning":"**My Shop Strategy: Maximize Constellation Scaling**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I'm in the shop phase, Ante 6, Round 15, and the goal is clear: maximize my score and push beyond Ante 6. I've got a decent bankroll of $58 to work with. The key here is my `Constellation` Joker; it's currently at x2.7 Mult, and it's my primary scaling engine, increasing by +0.1x for each Planet I use.\n\nLooking at my Jokers, I have:\n\n*   `Green Joker`: Solid +21 Mult\n*   `Spare Trousers`: +14 Mult on Two Pair\n*   `Certificate`: Adds random sealed card each round.\n*   `Luchador` (Polychrome): x1.5 Mult, boss disabler\n*   `Blue Joker`: +122 Chips (based on deck size)\n\nAll six slots are filled, so I need to be *very* selective about what I buy.\n\nConsidering the shop options:\n\n*   `Business Card`: I have plenty of money, and selling a Joker for this would weaken my setup. A definite no.\n*   `Wasteful` Voucher: +1 discard is generally nice, but it hurts my `Green Joker` build. Not worth it, especially at $10.\n*   Reroll: This is secondary to my main goal.\n\nMy first priority is to feed `Constellation`. I see a `Celestial Pack` available (Booster 1). That's perfect; the *most efficient* way to scale `Constellation` and potentially find key cards to level up hands. The $4 is a bargain.\n\nWait a second...I *think* I bought the first Celestial Pack already...I need to check previous state. Ah, yes, in turn 161 I bought booster 1, which *was* the Celestial pack. Then in turn 162 I was in the planet pack.\n\nLooking back, and considering I previously selected the Jupiter, booster 1 in the current shop is *still* the Celestial Pack! Looks like I had enough money to buy two Celestial Packs.\n\nSo, I buy the `Celestial Pack`! Let's get that `Constellation` scaling!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
