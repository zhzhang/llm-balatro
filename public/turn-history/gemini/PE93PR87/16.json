{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Analysis for Round 2**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2, Round 2. I've got $5 and a crucial decision to make. My goal is clear: maximize my score potential and set up for long-term scaling, especially with my current Joker lineup.\n\nI've got a killer set of Jokers: Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Mystic Summit (+15 Mult at 0 discards), Luchador (Polychrome X1.5 Mult), and, most importantly for this decision, Constellation (X1.0 Mult that scales with Planet cards). The fact that Constellation is Negative edition limits me to 6 Jokers, so I need to be careful with any future Joker acquisitions.\n\nThe shop presents these options: The Tower ($3), which enhances Stone cards; a Celestial Pack ($4); and Wasteful voucher ($10) I can't currently afford.\n\nMy initial thought is the Celestial Pack. I have $5, and the pack directly benefits Constellation by potentially giving me a Planet card to use. The Tower, on the other hand, isn't immediately critical for my scaling, and I'm not in a position to take advantage of the Wasteful Voucher right now. Rerolling the shop is not worth the $1, given the opportunity I'm now presented with.\n\nBefore I commit, I need to double-check my Joker order. Proper sequencing is key. My optimal order should be additive multipliers first (Smiley Face, Mystic Summit) followed by multiplicative multipliers (Luchador, Constellation). I double-checked, and my current order is already correct (1- Smiley, 2 - Mystic, 3 - Luchador, 4- Constellation). Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the best action here is to buy the Celestial Pack. This action not only gives me a chance to find a Planet card to scale Constellation. So, my immediate strategy will be to use a Planet card, and this will maximize the value of the hand I play.\n\n**Action:** `buy_booster 1` (Celestial Pack)\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
