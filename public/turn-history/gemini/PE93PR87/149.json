{"reasoning":"**The Shop: A Calculated Pause**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 6, Round 14. Currently holding $28 – interest caps at $25, so I'm optimizing for that. The shop’s up, and I need to assess what's worth pursuing. My core strategy revolves around Constellation scaling with Planets, so that's the primary lens I'm using. My current score is roughly what I need, but I'll need more scaling for later.\n\nFirst, the shop itself. The *Ceremonial Dagger* seems initially intriguing, but it destroys a joker. It would have to replace the Blue Joker, as my jokers are all useful. No way, the Dagger is not better than what I have. The *Square Joker* is a downgrade, especially with the Blue Joker providing +120 chips for any hand. The *Standard Pack* is a potential gamble, but I need to focus on essential stuff at this stage. $4 is okay, but I'm prioritizing finding Planets. The *Wasteful Voucher* is a non-starter. Discarding is counter to my setup, plus it would affect the Green Joker. \n\nRerolling? Tempting for potential Planets, but a $6 cost drops me below the interest threshold, so that is a big no. And I've already rerolled once, increasing the cost. The shop is exhausted for value, the current cards are just junk. The Standard Pack is a low priority.\n\nI’m carrying 2/2 consumables. If I *did* find a Planet, I would be able to use a consumable to hold it. And if a Planet showed up, I could use the \"buy_and_use_consumable\" action. But, nothing is available in the shop right now.\n\nMy current money, even at its full interest earning, is a good buffer to start the next round with more buying power. It's time to cash in and see the upcoming blinds. Since my current score (45k per hand for three-of-a-kind) is plenty, I can wait.\n\nNow, before committing, I need to review my current Jokers:\n*   Green Joker (+20 Mult)\n*   Spare Trousers (+12 Mult for Two Pair)\n*   Certificate (Adds a card)\n*   Luchador (x1.5 Mult)\n*   Constellation (x2.4 Mult, negative)\n*   Blue Joker (+120 Chips)\n\nI'm focused on the multiplicative and additive effects here. Let’s do the calculation: with a Level 7 Three of a Kind I am at 45k. With the additive and multiplicative effects of my Jokers, I should be able to get two or three hands to win the Boss for Ante 6.\n\nWith that in mind, I need to check my available options. The 'round_select' option should give me information about the next set of blinds. But wait, I need to see what my options are for my consumables.\n\n*Strength* can buff two cards and *Lovers* creates a wild card. But, I cannot see my hand right now. In the current SHOP state, you cannot use hand based Tarot effects, just like in previous turns. I can't target cards because I don't see my hand. I cannot use the tarot right now.\n\n*Final Decision:* **Proceed to round select**. No changes needed, save the money for the next shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
