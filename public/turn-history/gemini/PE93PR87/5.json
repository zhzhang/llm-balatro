{"reasoning":"**Initial Shop Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at the start of Ante 1/8, Round 1, in the SHOP phase. I've got two decent Jokers: Smiley Face, which gives +5 Mult for face cards played, and Mystic Summit, which gives +15 Mult if I have zero discards remaining. I've got a single dollar to my name.\n\nLooking at the shop, Uranus is a no-go at $3, Celestial Pack is out at $4, and Magic Trick is laughable at $10. Rerolling the shop for $5 isn't an option either. Essentially, I'm broke.\n\nMy Jokers are decent for now. Smiley Face will provide consistent Mult throughout the round as I play face cards, and Mystic Summit will act as a good source of Mult, if I can empty my hand each play. I already have both, so that's good.\n\nGiven my financial constraints, there's no real decision to make here. I can't buy anything. I can't reroll. I've already bought the Jokers I wanted. Therefore, the only logical action is to exit the shop and move on to the next round. I'm going to select the next blind. So, action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
