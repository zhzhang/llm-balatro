{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Round 17, deep into this run, with an ante of 7/8. Got $30 to work with, and the upcoming blinds are getting serious: 52.5k for the Big Blind and a nasty 70k for the Boss. Time to get my ducks in a row.\n\nMy current joker setup is decent: I've got a Green Joker that's scaling nicely (23 Mult currently), Spare Trousers to give me even more Mult with Two Pair, a Certificate for card generation, Luchador to disable the boss, Constellation for that sweet multiplier that grows with Planets, and a Blue Joker for some chip boost. Maxed out at 6 Jokers, and I'm at 0/2 for consumables.\n\nMy current consumables include The World (Converts 3 cards to Spades), The High Priestess (Creates up to 2 Planet cards), and The Sun (Converts 3 cards to Hearts). I've got two consumable slots open. The priority is definitely scaling Constellation, and the High Priestess can make planet cards.\n\nSo, the plan is obvious. I need to get those Planets rolling. I already used The Lovers, and now it's time to refill the slots. I'm going to choose the High Priestess. No need to worry about card positioning here, just activate it. The command is `select 2`. JSON structure: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2]}`.\n\nSpades and Hearts are a non-issue at this point. I'm prioritizing Planets for Constellation. My hand is a bit of a mishmash anyway, with only a Flush at level 3, Three of a Kind at 9, and a Pair at 8. I'm all about Spare Trousers and Constellation, so High Priestess it is. Let's get those multipliers up!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
