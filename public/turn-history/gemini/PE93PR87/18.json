{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Limited Options**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my current situation. It's Ante 2, Round 2. I've got a single dollar, and my Joker lineup is: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, and Constellation. The Constellation joker limits me to 6 jokers total, which is something to keep in mind for future decisions. I've got The Tower card in the shop, but it's out of my price range at $3. Wasteful voucher is there also for $10, which I can't afford either. No boosters are available. Rerolling the shop is also a no-go, as that costs $5.\n\nI'm checking if I can use any consumables, which I can't. Likewise, I don't have any to sell. My jokers are already arranged optimally, with additive multipliers coming before the multiplicative ones – Smiley Face and Mystic Summit first, then Luchador and Constellation. Selling a Joker is pointless right now because they're all useful. Buying a card is out because of the budget constraints. And, since I can't afford anything and have no consumables, I can't buy and use anything either.\n\nSo, the only feasible action to advance the game is `round_select`. This is a straightforward choice.\n\nTherefore, the action I'm taking is \"round_select\". I'll pass along that with null values for positions, hand type, and estimated chips, since none of them are relevant for this action. The JSON formatting is clean, single, and valid.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
