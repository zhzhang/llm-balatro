{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Execution: Final Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 8, Round 21, facing the final boss, Verdant Leaf. The goal is 100,000 chips. Let's see... currently in the shop. I only have $4, not enough to reroll ($6) or buy the Hone voucher ($10). The shop is empty of cards and boosters, so no luck there. I have some powerful jokers, but that Verdant Leaf debuff, ugh...\n\nMy Jokers are Green Joker (+Mult), Spare Trousers (+Mult), Certificate, Luchador (the key!), Constellation (x4 Mult, with that annoying -slot debuff), and Blue Joker (+Chips). I also have Judgement and The Magician consumables. Vouchers include Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Grabber, and Hieroglyph.\n\nThe Boss Blind is Verdant Leaf. \"All cards debuffed until 1 Joker sold.\" Aha! *That's* where Luchador comes in. My strategy is simple: enter the round and immediately sell Luchador to disable the debuff. Simple.\n\nI've checked the shop; it's a dead end. No buying, no rerolling. So, I need to move to the blind selection screen. The command is `round_select`.\n\nBefore I do that, quick joker check: I need to ensure the Jokers are positioned in the right order for maximum effect. Generally, the order of Jokers matters. Base Hand Chips/Mult, then +Chips Jokers, then +Mult, then xMult.\n\nLet's see: Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation, Blue Joker. Okay, right now, the positioning is *fine*: Green Joker (+Mult), Spare Trousers (+Mult), Blue Joker (+Chips), Certificate, Luchador (x1.5), Constellation (x4.0).\n\nThe order is critical for the Multiplier Jokers: I'm good with Green, Spare Trousers, Luchador, and Constellation. The Blue Joker at the end won't make a big difference, the order between +Mult and xMult is the critical thing. Chips will get added either way. So, this is the correct positioning.\n\nSince I can't buy anything, my only option is `round_select` to move to the boss fight. The Steel 2 of Hearts is now in my deck. I scored almost 100k last round and with the added card and the levels I have, 100k should be easy with Luchador active.\n\nSo, let's execute. I'm ready. The action is `round_select`, no positions needed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
