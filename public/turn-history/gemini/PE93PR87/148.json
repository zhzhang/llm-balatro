{"reasoning":"**Rerolling for Planetary Alignment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 6, Round 14. I've got $33, which is nice, but I need to optimize this setup to push for Ante 8. My current Jokers are solid, but I need to scale, and that means Planets for Constellation.\n\n*   `Even Steven` and `Wily Joker` are not worth it, useless cards in the shop.\n*   The `Standard Pack` is tempting, but deck consistency isn't the priority.\n*   `Wasteful` is a no-go with Green Joker.\n*   I can reroll or buy a Standard Pack.\n*   My money is $33. Interest caps at $25. Can afford a reroll or a pack without dropping below the interest.\n*   `Constellation` needs Planet cards. None are in the shop, so I need to find them.\n\nMy current Mult calculation is: (Base + Green Joker + Spare Trousers) \\* Luchador (x1.5) \\* Constellation (x2.4). Blue Joker adds chips. For Three of a Kind, I'm at roughly 45,630 points. It's strong for the current Ante, but I need scaling for Ante 8.\n\nI'm thinking: Reroll for Planets/better Jokers over buying the Standard Pack.\n\nLet's double-check the Joker order. Yes, Luchador and Constellation are to the right of the +mult jokers. The chip Jokers are at the right end of the lineup.\n\nRerolling is definitely better for finding Planets. I had a Death last round, but I can improve upon that, so I'll stay proactive. I used `Death` previously, so no need to save `Strength`.\n\nI can afford to spend, reroll. But should I get the pack first and *then* reroll to avoid being below $25? No.\n\n$33 - 5 (reroll) = $28. Perfect, if I find a planet ($3), I'm at $25. If I don't, I get interest.\n\nI'm checking the standard pack one last time... Nope. Reroll!\n\nSo, the action is `reroll_shop`. No positional arguments needed.\n\nI'll execute the reroll. Ready.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
