{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment: Optimizing Arcana Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I'm in the shop phase, specifically looking at the Arcana Pack choices. My primary engine right now is the Constellation Joker, which scales with planet cards. I have a solid base with a good hand level and a decent money buffer at $30. My current jokers are: Green (+13 Mult, Holo), Spare Trousers (+18 Mult), Certificate (adds cards), Luchador (x1.5 Mult, Boss disable), Constellation (x3.4 Mult), and Blue (+110 Chips) - all slots are filled.\n\nThe choices are: The Emperor (creates Tarot cards), The Fool (duplicates the last Tarot/Planet, excluding Pluto), and The Star (converts cards to Diamonds). The Star is useless. The Emperor has some potential but is reliant on RNG.\n\nThe key here is The Fool. Its description says \"Creates the last Tarot or Planet card used during this run The Fool excluded Pluto\". At first glance, that's slightly confusing wording, as it says it *excludes Pluto*. That suggests it won't give me Pluto. But wait! The secondary description says it will level up High Card (+1 Mult, +10 Chips) which is specifically what Pluto does. This confirms it creates Pluto! Using Pluto will immediately boost Constellation to x3.5, and level up High Card. That's a guaranteed +0.1 Multiplier increase.\n\nI'm definitely going to select The Fool. It's the most direct and reliable way to get a planet card into play, and it will go into my consumable inventory.\n\nLet's look at the actions:\n\n`select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1>...`\n\nSince The Fool is a consumable card, it doesn't need any hand targets.\n\nFinal decision: Select The Fool (position 2).\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
