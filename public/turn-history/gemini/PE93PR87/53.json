{"reasoning":"**Strategic Card Play: Ante 2, Round 6 - The Pillar Boss**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 2, Round 6, Boss Blind – The Pillar. I'm starting with zero chips, and I need 1600. I have three hands left and four discards. My inventory is key: Smiley Face (+5 mult for face cards), Mystic Summit (+15 mult with 0 discards), Spare Trousers (scaling with Two Pair or Full House), Luchador (x1.5 mult), Constellation (x1.4 mult), and a Certificate (adding a sealed card). My initial hand is: Queen of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, Unknown, 9 of Diamonds, 8 of Diamonds.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are the Boss effect: \"7 cards get drawn face down\". Given the layout, it's card 7 that's currently unknown. The game's often somewhat ambiguous phrasing (\"in 7 cards get drawn face down\"), and I need to deduce its specific mechanics, but it doesn't currently apply to my discards.\n\nLet's assess the hand. I have a Queen pair. Potential for straights or better plays are worth considering. The goal is to maximize Spare Trousers with Two Pair or Full House. I need to get there quickly. My top priority is Mystic Summit's +15 mult for 0 discards.\n\nOriginally, I was thinking about a straight with the 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, but that's a long shot. After assessing the cards I was ready to discard, I had the idea to consider what the 9 of Diamonds does: \"Creates the Planet card for final played poker hand of round if held in hand (Must have room)\". This must be related to the Certificate's Sealed Card. I need to keep the 9 of Diamonds for the final hand of the round to get a Planet for Constellation.\n\nNow, let's find the best discard play to get to 0 discards for Mystic Summit, while keeping the 9 of Diamonds for the final play.\n\nThe best plan is to try to achieve the win in one play. That requires a big play.\n\nGiven that my primary goal is 1600 chips, and I have 3 hands, I see this now as a simple process.\n\nAction: discard the 7, 6, Ace, and 10, keeping the 9 of Diamonds for the final play.\n\nSo, I discard cards 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,7]"}
