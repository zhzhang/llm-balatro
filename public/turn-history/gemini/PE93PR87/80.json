{"reasoning":"**Shop Decision Time: Ante 3, Boss Blind Looming!**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 3/8, boss blind is coming up, and it's shop time! I've got $41, which is a decent starting point. My joker setup is interesting: Green Joker is a straight multiplier (+11 mult), Mystic Summit is high value at +15 mult but needs 0 discards, Spare Trousers gets me +2 mult if I play Two Pairs, Luchador will disable the boss entirely (Polychrome, x1.5), and Constellation needs planets to scale (currently x1.9). Certificate provides a random sealed card, and Justice is my only consumable. I've also got Hieroglyph, which grants -1 to Ante.\n\nThe immediate goal is the upcoming boss blind: \"No repeat hand types\" and 4000 chips. Economy is strong right now, and I have several options in the shop: Square Joker, Zany Joker, Standard Pack, Arcana Pack, and Wasteful Voucher. I also have the option to reroll.\n\nMy jokers have solid synergy. Green Joker is great for playing a variety of hands, Mystic Summit really doesn't want me to discard, Trousers wants Two Pair, and Constellation screams for Planets to become powerful. Wasteful Voucher is *bad* news because of Mystic Summit and Green Joker.\n\nI definitely need to find Planet cards for Constellation to really take off. I have $41. Ideally, I want to use the shop to get those. Right now I can't think of any reason to buy either of the jokers.\n\nThe Boss Blind requires me to play different hand types, which is interesting. Luchador is an easy out if it becomes too difficult, but 4000 chips is a relatively low value.\n\nI think the best move is to *first* check the Arcana Pack for potential Planet cards (The High Priestess comes to mind) or useful cards in general. That's a good investment. Rerolling the shop is also something to consider if the pack is a bust, since the shop may have Planet cards available for purchase.\n\nOkay, I'm going to *buy* the Arcana Pack for $4, which will leave me with $37. If the pack doesn't give me what I need, I'll consider rerolling to look for Planets directly in the shop. I need to keep the optimal joker order in mind: Green (Additive Mult) -> Mystic (Additive Mult) -> Trousers (Additive Mult) -> Luchador (Multiplicative, but conditional) -> Constellation (Multiplicative).\n\nWait, I need to use `buy_booster 2` to buy an Arcana pack, not `buy_and_use_consumable`!\n\nSo, action: `buy_booster 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
