{"reasoning":"**Here's the breakdown of my decision-making process for this round:**\n\nAlright, I'm in the SHOP phase, specifically a `PLANET_PACK` within a Celestial Pack. My goal is to comfortably hit Ante 6, Round 15, and I need to scale up for the upcoming Boss Blind. I've got $54, so I'm looking for the best play here.\n\nI've got a solid Joker setup: `Green Joker` giving a big mult, `Spare Trousers` boosting Two Pair (though I need to remember Full House doesn't help it!), `Luchador` for potential Boss Blind disabling, `Constellation` primed for Planet card usage, and a `Blue Joker` for those sweet chips. The `Certificate` gives me a random card, which can be useful and I have \"The Lovers\" consumable, a wild card.\n\nNow, the pack options: I've got `Earth` (Full House), `Jupiter` (Flush), and `Saturn` (Straight). My strategy is to use the Planet card to increase the `Constellation` multiplier, as it scales off Planet usage. Also, leveling up a hand is important.\n\n*   `Earth` (Full House): Currently Level 5. It's a solid hand, and a decent option to level up\n*   `Jupiter` (Flush): Currently Level 3. Okay, but I've played Flushes a few times\n*   `Saturn` (Straight): Currently Level 3. I have not played this hand yet.\n\n`Full House` or `Flush` are the main contenders. Given my current hand levels, my `Three of a Kind` and `Pair` are already quite high, and I'm currently playing smaller hands to scale `Green Joker` and `Spare Trousers`. `Full House` is already level 5 (and the highest level hand in these choices). If I need a big scoring hand later, it's more likely to be reachable than `Straight`.\n\nNow, the choice *isn't solely* about the Planet card itself (though that is my secondary goal), but rather activating `Constellation`, adding +0.1x Multi. So, the ideal scenario is to pick an option from this celestial pack.\n\nI am thinking I previously took a Flush and this is my second Celestial Pack, so the best option would be Earth.\n\nI should note that while `Full House` *contains* `Pair` and `Three of a Kind`, it does *not* contain `Two Pair`, which is the scaling for `Spare Trousers`.\n\nAfter a final review, I will select `Earth` (Position 1). This is my action. I will get `Constellation` up to x2.8.\nMy Full House will be level 6 and the estimated chips, 50k is enough for the upcoming Ante 6.\n```json\n{\"action\":\"select\",\"positions\":[1],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
