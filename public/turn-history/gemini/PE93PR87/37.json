{"reasoning":"**My Current Game State: A Calculated Pause**\n\nOkay, so here's the breakdown. We're in Ante 2, Round 4, having just benefited from the Hieroglyph voucher, which dropped us down from Ante 3. We're sitting on $6, which is just enough to get the interest bonus next round, something I don't want to lose. My Joker setup is optimized, placing the additive multipliers (Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, and Spare Trousers) before the multiplicative ones (Luchador, Constellation). I've got a full house of Jokers – six in total.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Half Joker is a non-starter for my strategy, and the Standard Pack is tempting, but with my current cash flow, it would be a bad idea to sacrifice my interest income for a small chance at new cards. I have the Certificate Joker, so card generation is covered to an extent. The priority is to save cash for the interest and the next shop, so no buying today.\n\nI've already reordered my Jokers, I don't have anything to sell, use, or buy. The shop is offering me nothing. Therefore, the obvious next step is to choose the next round, which is a `round_select` action. No need to specify hand types, positions, or anything like that. Based on the ante and round, I'm heading towards a blind. The small blind, then the big blind, then the boss blind.\n\nThe situation is clear: I've maxed out my options in the current shop, and `round_select` is the optimal path.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
