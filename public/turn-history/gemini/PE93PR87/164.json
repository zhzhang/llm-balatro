{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Rerolling the Shop**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're at Ante 6, with $54. My primary goal is to scale up that juicy `Constellation` joker, which is currently at x2.8 mult. I need planets, and I need them *bad*. My current jokers are pretty solid: `Green Joker` for base mult, `Spare Trousers` also for base, `Luchador` for x1.5 mult and boss-disabling, `Blue Joker` for chips, and the all-important `Constellation` to scale. The `Certificate` is helping grow the deck, which feeds the `Blue Joker`, which helps me buy things, which might help me find planet cards. I have the `The Lovers` consumable, but that can wait, for now.\n\nThe shop itself is pretty underwhelming: a `Business Card` (not useful with a full joker slots), `Wasteful` (anti-synergistic with my discard strategy), and a reroll. Rerolling is the play here. I'm flush with cash, well above the interest cap, so that $5 reroll is a no-brainer. I'm looking for planets or planet packs to feed `Constellation`. Let's confirm: 6/6 joker slots used, full.\n\nLet's quickly check my joker ordering. Chip jokers last, mult jokers next, and x-mult jokers last. This doesn't apply to this particular state. Additive multipliers first, then multiplicative. The order *within* the multiplicative jokers does not matter. The current arrangement of the Jokers:\n1.  Green (+11)\n2.  Spare Trousers (+14)\n3.  Luchador (x1.5)\n4.  Constellation (x2.8)\nLooks good.\n\nI have a `Wasteful` voucher, but that is generally bad for my `Green Joker`.\n\nLet's confirm the reasoning. I have money ($54). Reroll is cheap ($5). I want Planets. The current shop has no Planets or packs. *Reroll*.\n\nI might use `The Lovers`, but not right now. I have enough money to buy cards in the future.\n\nJust for clarity, I will re-check my bankroll: $54, and the reroll cost ($5).\n\nOkay, what's next? Oh, the user wants a single parseable JSON object. Got it. So, just the action. `reroll_shop`. I can see if there are any planets in the shop.\n\nLet's double-check the `Constellation` and Joker slots. 6/6 slots are full, confirming the plan.\n\nI have decided to `reroll_shop`.\n\nI just need to look at the shop for cards that will help scale me.\n\nLet's check the JSON. `{\"action\": \"reroll_shop\"}`.\n\nOne last check. Rerolling is the play. I'm looking for scaling.\n\nSo, the play is `{\"action\": \"reroll_shop\"}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
