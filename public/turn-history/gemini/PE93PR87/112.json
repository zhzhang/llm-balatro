{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Selection: Prioritizing Constellation and Hand Leveling**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in the PLANET\\_PACK phase, specifically the Jumbo Celestial Pack. My core goal is to pick the best planet card to pump up my Constellation multiplier and, ideally, level up my hands for better payouts. I've got $34, and a decent joker setup: Green Joker for a big flat mult boost, Mystic Summit for a nice mult if I'm conservative, Spare Trousers that scales with Two Pair (key here), Certificate for some extra cards, Luchador for boss disable, and that pesky Constellation card which is currently giving me a x2.2 multiplier but scales negatively.\n\nEach planet card I use will increase the Constellation multiplier by x0.1. So the main question is which card boosts my overall strategy.\n\nLet's break down the choices. I have:\n\n1.  Mercury (Level 5 Pair): Good consistency, solid.\n2.  Jupiter (Level 1 Flush): Totally irrelevant.\n3.  Pluto (Level 1 High Card): Not on my radar.\n4.  Earth (Level 4 Full House): Decent base stats and on the cusp of leveling up.\n5.  Venus (Level 5 Three of a Kind): Already pretty strong and will be the first to upgrade.\n\nI'm currently playing Spare Trousers, so the main driver for multiplicative mult is Two Pair. I would ideally want Uranus (Two Pair) but, alas, it isn't here. So, let's think. The options are Mercury, Venus, or Earth.\n\nMercury (Pair) is a good backup plan because it is part of a Two Pair, and if I can't find a Two Pair, it's the next best bet. Venus (Three of a Kind) also works well, but I'm primarily focused on Two Pair. Earth (Full House) gives the most stats.\n\nIdeally I want Two Pair (Uranus). However, with Spare Trousers, I need to pick which card benefits a Two Pair fallback.\n\nLooking at the Last Played Hands, the AI played Two Pair twice last round. Based on this, it looks like a Two Pair (or fallback) is my best approach.\n\nLet's look at the levels:\n\n*   Full House (Earth) is Level 4 -> 5.\n*   Three of a Kind (Venus) is Level 5 -> 6.\n*   Pair (Mercury) is Level 5 -> 6.\n\nThree of a Kind is better than Pair, so that's the better backup. Full House would be better, but harder to hit. Plus, the Certificate adds cards, so a Three of a Kind is easier to hit.\n\nI could choose Venus or Earth, but Venus is easier to hit and still pretty good.\n\nLet's do some stats:\n\n*   Mercury (Lvl 5): 70 chips, 6 mult.\n*   Venus (Lvl 5): 110 chips, 11 mult.\n*   Upgrading Venus to Lvl 6: 130 chips, 13 mult.\n*   Upgrading Mercury to Lvl 6: 85 chips, 7 mult.\n\nVenus is the clear winner for my next hand.\n\nSo, I'm going to **select Venus**. The plan is still to scale Constellation but with the better hand.\n\n**Action: `select`**\n\n**Position: 5 (Venus)**\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
