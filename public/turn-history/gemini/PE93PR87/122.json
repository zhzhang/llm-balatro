{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Dilemma: Prioritizing Planets and Joker Optimization**\n\nOkay, I'm in Ante 5, Round 12 of Balatro with $33 to spend. The primary goal is to maximize my score to beat the blinds, and especially to scale Constellation using Planet cards. Spare Trousers and Green Joker are already scaling well, and I have to balance managing the economy.\n\nThe Joker slots are full. I've got a Green Joker (good mult), Mystic Summit (conditional mult), Spare Trousers (scales Two Pair), Certificate (adds random cards), Luchador (Polychrome, boss disable), and Constellation (negative, scales Planets).\n\nThe Shop offers a \"Shoot the Moon\" card, Ice Cream (chips), a Mega Buffoon Pack (Jokers), Voucher: Tarot Merchant, and Reroll.\n\nMy first thought is the Tarot Merchant ($10). It could lead to more Tarot cards (potentially Purple Seals) and more shop slots for Tarot, which *should* increase Planet card appearance... but isn't a direct boost to Planets. The previous strategy was buy Arcana Pack, *then* Tarot Merchant. Let's do that now.\n\nThe Mega Buffoon Pack ($8) could offer better Jokers, but I'd have to sell one. Mystic Summit is the weakest link, but it's conditional. It's not a direct buff, while Green Joker is a passive bonus. I have a lot of good scaling jokers already.\n\nI could buy Ice Cream ($5) for a huge temporary chip boost, but it will decay and I don't have enough room. It's a tricky choice to sell Luchador for Ice Cream. I could swap Summit for Ice Cream, it seems like the better trade.\n\nThe real priority is Planets. This means I should buy the Mega Buffoon Pack for the chance to improve my existing Jokers, but first I should buy the Voucher.\n\nHowever, I've already bought the Arcana Pack, and now the shop has been re-evaluated.\n\nI want to buy the Tarot Merchant.\n\nA quick review of the Joker list: Green Joker, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome), Constellation. I need to keep Green Joker as my main Joker.\n\nBefore I commit, I'll analyze the synergy. Mystic Summit is only good at 0 discards remaining. Since Green Joker penalizes discards, this is a net loss. This confirms I should look for a joker to replace Mystic Summit, if possible.\n\nSo, the plan is confirmed: Buy the Tarot Merchant. That leaves $23.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_voucher\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
