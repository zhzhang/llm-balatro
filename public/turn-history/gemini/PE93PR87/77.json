{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Ante 3, Round 7**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 3, Round 7. I've got $27. I have a decent hand right now, and I'm in the shop. I need to make some decisions.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid: Green Joker (Holo, scaling +10 Mult, good with hands but loses with discards), Mystic Summit (+15 Mult at 0 discards), Spare Trousers (+2 Mult for Two Pair), Certificate (a utility, spawns a sealed card), Luchador (Polychrome, x1.5 Mult, disables bosses), and Constellation (Negative: x1.9 Mult scaling with planets, but +1 slot).\n\nI've got a Justice consumable ready. I have the Hieroglyph voucher for -1 Ante, -1 hand. I'm looking at Wily Joker (+100 chips on 3 of a Kind) and Clever Joker (+80 chips on 2 Pair) in the shop, a Buffoon Pack for $4, and the terrible Wasteful voucher (+1 discard, terrible synergy). Reroll is at $6.\n\nConstellation scales with Planets, Green Joker with hand size. Mystic Summit needs zero discards. Spare Trousers scales with Two Pair hands. It looks like I'm building multi-scaling, but my chip generation is a bit low.\n\nWily/Clever Jokers are tempting for chips, especially Wily since I've played 3 of a Kind before, but I'm at 6/6 Joker slots, full. Buffoon Pack might give me a better joker. Wasteful is bad. Reroll is expensive now.\n\nI've got a decent power set. I'm thinking the next blind should be easy.\n\nLet's estimate my Mult: (Base + Green scaling + 15 Summit + 2 Trousers) * 1.5 * 1.9. If my Base is around 10 (Full House level 4), it's about 105. With chips at around 115 (Full House), my score is around 12k.\n\nI'm sitting at $27. Saving up for that sweet $25 interest is smart. No need to sell anything *right now*. The Buffoon pack could give me a better Joker, maybe I should replace Summit or Trousers. But... saving money is also smart, especially if I can find a Planet to scale Constellation! Okay, let's see. $4 for the pack, leaving $23. I lose the interest bonus.\n\nMy last action was a reroll. The shop Jokers aren't worth swapping. The Buffoon Pack is a reasonable gamble for $4. But building economy is the best path. I have enough power for now. I should save money or find Planets. Since no planets are available and I've already rerolled, I'm going to round select.\n\nWait, I'm at 6/6 Jokers. Constellation's Negative effect gives me the extra slot. I'm full.\n\nLet's look at Round 7: Small Blind is 2800, Big Blind is 4000, and the Boss Blind is 8000. My 12k score crushes that.\n\nAction: round select.\n\nOh, wait. I have Justice. I can use that next round. It requires cards in hand, so I don't need it now.\n\nIs there any reason to buy the Buffoon Pack? It's cheap. Let's see if I can get something better than Spare Trousers (+2 mult) or Mystic Summit (+15). But at $27, if I buy, I have $23, and I lose the interest. Not worth it!\n\nLet's double-check my Joker order: Green, Mystic, Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation. Good, it's (Mult)+ then (xMult).\n\n**Conclusion:** Round Select.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
