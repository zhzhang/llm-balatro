{"reasoning":"**Initial Decision: Smiley Face for Early Game Stability**\n\nOkay, first ante, round one. I've got $6, no jokers, no consumables. The pack choices are Smiley Face, which gives +5 Mult per face card played, and Shoot the Moon, +13 Mult per Queen held. Considering early game, Smiley Face looks like the more reliable choice. There are 12 face cards in a standard deck; triggering +5 Mult consistently seems easier than relying on holding Queens. Shoot the Moon is stronger per card, but only when Queens are *held*, which can restrict hand building.\n\nSmiley Face is essentially \"free\" since it comes with the pack. This leaves me with $6, and the Mystic Summit is in the shop for $5. If I buy that, I'll have two jokers, the \"free\" Smiley Face and Mystic Summit. Mystic Summit gives +15 Mult if I have zero discards. Smiley Face (+5 per face card) + Mystic Summit (+15 if 0 discards) would be a solid base for Ante 1 and 2.\n\nThe action is a `select` command; the target is `1` for Smiley Face. I'm not playing a hand right now, so no hand type or estimated chips are relevant.\n\nI need to confirm the select command targets the booster pack positions. Smiley Face is indeed at position 1. And, double-checking, if I play a Full House with three Jacks, Smiley Face gives +15 Mult, if I play a pair of Kings, Smiley Face gives +10 Mult, making it more flexible. Smiley Face is the clear choice.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
