{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Shop Priorities**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop during Ante 3, Round 6, with $38. I've got a decent hand, and now it's time to optimize before the next round. My core strategy right now revolves around scaling the Constellation joker, which gives me multiplier based on Planet cards played. I have two Mercury cards in my inventory, which are Planet cards. These are key! My Pair hand also levels up when I use them.\n\nThe immediate priority is to use those Mercuries. I'll use the first one, which will increase Constellation's multiplier and level up my Pair hand. After this, I'll use the second Mercury card for similar effect. I need to make the most of this opportunity.\n\nSo, the action is `use_consumable` on the first Mercury card. My final order will be:\n\n`action`: \"use_consumable\"\n`positions`: [1]\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
