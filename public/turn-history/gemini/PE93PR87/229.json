{"reasoning":"**My Strategy for the Final Boss**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop after the Big Blind, Ante 8, Round 21, and the final boss, Verdant Leaf, is looming with its nasty 100k chip requirement and debuffing effect on all cards. My goal is to maximize my chip output to crush this boss. I have $21, and a solid Joker lineup: Green Joker (+26 Mult), Spare Trousers (+20 Mult), Certificate (card generation), Luchador (x1.5 Mult, boss disable), Constellation (x3.9 Mult, scaling), and Blue Joker (+136 Chips). Plus, I'm holding a Judgement consumable.\n\nI'm thinking, my main engine right now is *Constellation*. It's already at x3.9, and the boss strategy involves disabling its blind with the Luchador, which I can do right now. My pair is Level 10, which is also handy. My current jokers are a solid combination of chips, mult, and a solid constellation multiplier. I am at 6/6 joker slots.\n\nI have a Jumbo Standard Pack ($6), Golden Joker, and Superposition in the shop, but nothing really jumps out. Buying the pack could be a gamble, but I could get something better. Rerolling ($5) is my priority. I'm hoping to find Planet cards (Mercury, Mars, etc.) to further scale *Constellation*.\n\nNow, the crucial question is: do I sell Luchador now or wait? The prompt says \"no boss active\" for a reason. Selling it now disables the boss blind *immediately*. I'm going to do that to save the stress.\n\nI have two potential actions in the shop: either buy a Jumbo Standard Pack for a potential card upgrade ($6), or reroll ($5) to try to find planets. I already used a Tarot pack (Justice on Ace of Hearts). Reroll.\n\nOkay, let's look at the numbers. At 100k target:\n\n*   11 (pair base mult) + 26 (Green) + 20 (Trousers) = ~57 mult\n*   57 \\* 1.5 (Luchador) \\* 3.9 (Constellation) = 333 mult\n*   145 (pair base) + 136 (Blue) + 20 (from cards) = ~300 chips\n*   333 \\* 300 = \\~100k chips\n\nI'm very close to the win. I am going to lean toward *Constellation* scaling, but I have enough money for a roll or a pack.\n\nI can *reroll_shop* for $5, and the Jumbo Standard Pack is $6. Rerolling is better to find planets. Let's see if the shop changes when I go to `round_select`.\n\nSince I'm in the shop, I will spend my money. I'm going to `reroll_shop` for $5. Let's go! I'm ready to find that Mercury.\n\n**Action: `reroll_shop`**.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
