{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis: Targeting Planet Cards**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, Round 13, $58 in the bank. The objective is clear: reach Ante 8. The primary strategy hinges on scaling the `Constellation` joker by using Planet cards and then supplementing it with `Spare Trousers`, `Green Joker`, `Certificate`, and `Blue Joker`. Right now, I'm thinking Three of a Kind (Level 6) for hand level, with scaling from `Spare Trousers` at Two Pair (Level 1).\n\nMy current Joker lineup is: `Green Joker` (+19 Mult), `Spare Trousers` (+12 Mult), `Certificate`, `Luchador` (x1.5 Mult), `Constellation` (x2.3 Mult), and `Blue Joker` (+118 chips). I'm focusing on finding those Planet cards.\n\nThe shop is offering `Wheel of Fortune` ($3), `Justice` ($3), and a `Standard Pack` ($4), and the Reroll is $5. No Planet cards are in sight, and I've already bought the Arcana pack. Should I gamble on the `Wheel of Fortune`? It's cheap, and the chance of improving a joker is tempting, especially the base ones.\n\nMy initial thought is to buy and use the `Wheel of Fortune` first, since I can buy it and use it immediately. The best-case scenario is getting a good edition upgrade, and it's a good price. Then, I'll reroll the shop to search for Planet cards or packs. The `Standard Pack` isn't a priority right now, given the limited funds.\n\nLooking at the current shop, the `Wheel of Fortune` at position 1 is the play. I have $58 so the gamble seems reasonable.\n\nIt looks like the `Wheel of Fortune` could potentially enhance `Green Joker`, `Spare Trousers`, or `Blue Joker`. `Luchador` is already Polychrome, `Green Joker` is already Holo, and `Constellation` is Negative. `Wheel` could also improve `Certificate`, but the odds are lower there.\n\nThe action I'll take is `buy_and_use_consumable` at position 1. I'll need to reroll after this to get the shop looking as good as possible.\n\nBefore I commit, let me check the schema... Yep. The schema specifies that `buy_and_use_consumable` action takes a `<consumable_position>`, and the positions field requires an integer array. Looks good. The current Joker order should also be okay (Green -> Trousers -> Certificate -> Luchador -> Constellation -> Blue).\n\nOkay, after double-checking the schema and joker order, I am confident with the play.\n\nLet's execute: `buy_and_use_consumable` 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
