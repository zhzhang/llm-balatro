{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Seeking Optimal Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6, Big Blind 15. I need to get 3,210 chips, I'm currently at 26,790. With 3 hands remaining, I have a decent shot to clear this. I have a strong collection of Jokers: a holo Green Joker adding a massive flat mult, a Spare Trousers with good flat mult, a Luchador and Constellation for multipliers, and the Blue Joker for a flat chip bonus. I've also got a \"Certificate\" card, and the Lovers consumable. I also have the 9 of Clubs with a Purple Seal, which creates a Tarot card on discard.\n\nI'm holding a hand of: 7S, 4S, 4S, 9C (Purple Seal), 5C, KD, 6D, 2D (Gold card). I can win easily with High Card, which will give me +123 chips and ~138 mult.\n\nMy primary thought is using the 9C for a Tarot. It's a \"waste not\" situation. It's worth a small penalty to the Green Joker in exchange for a Tarot that might improve my long-term scaling, especially since I'm at Ante 6. I could discard 1, 4, 5, 7. This is the optimal discard, because I can look for a second pair next turn to boost my Trousers, as well as get the Tarot. I want to keep the Gold card, for the money at the end of the round. The Lovers card will be saved for now.\n\nLet me double-check the order of Jokers. Current is optimal: additive mult first, then multiplicative.\n\nGreen Joker, if I discard, loses 1 Mult. But the Tarot is probably worth a small loss.\n\nI'll proceed with discarding 1, 4, 5, 7. It creates the 4 new cards, the Tarot, and readies for the next hand.\n\nAction: `discard`, positions: `[1, 4, 5, 7]`. It's the best option here.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,7]"}
