{"reasoning":"**Strategic Deep Dive: Ante 8 Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 8, and the pressure's on. I've got a solid Constellation scaling strategy going (x3.6 right now), but I need to find more Planet cards to keep it climbing. I'm sitting on $16. The current shop is offering The Hanged Man, Seance, a Jumbo Standard Pack, and Hone. None of these directly help my scaling, which is my immediate priority. I'm *this* close to the finish line, so I need to make the right moves now.\n\nThe Hanged Man *could* be useful for deck thinning, but it doesn't help my primary strategy and actually hurts my Blue Joker which relies on deck size. Seance is useless since I'm at max Joker capacity. The Jumbo Standard Pack is a distraction, and Hone is a long-term play, but I need instant gratification at this point. The Reroll is $7, which means I'll have $9 left. That's enough to pick up a Planet or two if they appear, which I desperately need to keep my Constellation scaling going. Since the Judgement card is in a consumable slot, I can't even use it right now.\n\nI've already rerolled twice this shop, but it's Ante 8, so I need to go big or go home. It's time to take a gamble and go for a Planet. I have $16. Rerolling costs $7, leaving $9. I'm committed to finding a Planet, even if it leaves me with very little cash after the reroll.\n\nI considered my Joker order. Green Joker and Spare Trousers are flat Mult, while Luchador and Constellation are Mult multipliers. Blue Joker is chips. The current order is optimal. Chips, then flat mult, then multiplier. It's the standard scoring order. I want to keep it that way.\n\nSo, I'm going to take one more roll for a Planet. The strategy is to go for broke, keep the Constellation running, and take the chance.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
