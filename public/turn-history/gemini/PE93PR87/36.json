{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization in Ante 2, Round 4**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Thanks to Hieroglyph, we are back in Ante 2, Round 4. Got $6 and a solid Joker setup: Smiley Face (face card Multiplier), Mystic Summit (flat Multiplier), Luchador (Polychrome X1.5), Constellation (X1.1 with scaling), Certificate (free cards), and Spare Trousers (scaling Multiplier for Two Pair/Full Houses). I'm thinking about maximizing score and building a solid engine for the long run.\n\nThe shop offers a Half Joker and a Standard Pack. The Half Joker clashes with my existing strategy. The Standard Pack is tempting, but Certificate already provides cards each round, so it's probably not worth it right now.\n\nMy options: Buy Standard Pack (loses interest), Buy Half Joker (doesn't synergize and no space), Reroll Shop (high risk for low reward), or exit the shop. Saving money for interest is best and preserving interest is critical, potentially finding Planet cards, or Vouchers.\n\nThe Joker setup is looking great for this stage: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, Constellation, Certificate, and Spare Trousers. The `Standard Pack` is okay, but I can already build the deck through other means. The smart move is `round_select` to save money.\n\nWait! Standard Pack is $4. I have $6. If I buy it, I have $2. I lose $1 interest. Certificate is already adding cards. Is a Standard Pack worth $5 (4 cost + 1 interest loss)? Probably not right now. I'd rather save for Planet cards or Vouchers.\n\nI checked the Joker order: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, Constellation, Certificate, Spare Trousers. This order matters. The additive Multipliers (Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers) should be to the left of the multiplicative Multipliers (Luchador, Constellation).\n\nI just looked at the math, but I should rearrange jokers to put Spare Trousers before Luchador/Constellation. The ideal sequence for Multiplier operations is: (Base Mult + Smiley Face + Mystic Summit + SpareTrousers_Mult) * Luchador_X * Constellation_X.\n\nNow for a crucial decision. If I rearrange, that's one action. If I go to the Round Select screen, that's another. Usually, the AI should provide the \"best\" next step. Let's re-read the Joker descriptions. I am double-checking, but it looks solid. I am just going to pick `round_select`.\n\nLet me look at the shop: $6. Reroll is $5. Standard pack $4. If I buy the Standard pack, I might get a face card (good for Smiley Face) or a high-rank card. However, interest is important.\n\nI am re-reading the descriptions, as there might be a bug. The text block seems to contain repeats of other jokers, but I understand the Luchador's unique properties. I have 6/6 Jokers.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\nWait, the next step. If I want to be optimal, I should move `Spare Trousers` (position 6) to the left of the XMult jokers (positions 3 and 4). That is my priority.\n\nI could have the engine running perfectly now, and the optimal action is `round_select`, however, the small optimization by rearranging is critical in the long run. Rearranging can be done at the start of the round or inside the round before playing the hand. In this game, sometimes the most \"progressive\" action is requested.\n\nI'll check the shop. I'm done. I'm proceeding to `round_select`. I'll rearrange before the end of the round. Interest is better. Saving is key.\n\nI am checking the `Standard Pack` in the shop. I'll skip it.\n\nYes, the +Mult should come before the XMult.\n\nI'll perform the rearrangement first: `rearrange_jokers` [1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5].\n\nI'm ready to `round_select`.\n\nWait, should I buy the `Standard Pack` to try and get a `Lucky` or `Glass` card? With $6, the interest is $1. If I spend $4, I lose $1 interest. Total cost: $5. Is one card worth $5 when I get them for free from Certificate? Probably not.\n\nFinal decision: `round_select`.\n\nIt needs to scale. I need to play Two Pairs or Full Houses. I've played 3 Full Houses and 1\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,3,4,5]"}
