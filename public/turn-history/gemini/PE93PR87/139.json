{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization: Planets Ahoy!**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 5/8, Round 13, and the Boss Blind is looming – The Pillar. My current focus? Scaling that beautiful `Constellation` joker. It's already at x2.3, so I need to hunt down some Planet cards. I've got $47, six jokers (including the key `Constellation`, `Green Joker`, `Spare Trousers`, `Luchador`, and the chip-boosting `Blue Joker`), and a couple of consumables: `The Lovers` and `Strength`. The shop's offering `Vampire`, which is tempting, but would require selling a joker. Right now, planets are the priority.\n\nThe Pillar is the Boss Blind, and its description, \"Debuffs any card played this ante\" is something to consider. However, the shop phase comes before playing cards; I'm safe now. I need to make the best use of my resources.\n\nLooking at my available actions: I can `reroll_shop`, `buy_booster 1`, or potentially `sell_consumable`. I can also get to the `round_select` phase.\n\n`Reroll_shop` is the obvious choice. It costs $6, leaving me with $41. This is the fastest way to find those Planet cards I need. `Buy_booster 1` – a standard pack – is less useful in this situation, and I don't see any value in it. `Sell_consumable` is an option, but I have enough money. Selling `The Lovers` or `Strength` is a last resort. Those consumables aren't useful in the current phase.\n\n`The Lovers` could be decent if I were to buy `Vampire`, but I'm not. `Strength` is useful for deck manipulation, but not right now. I'm sitting on enough money.\n\nThe current game state is the SHOP. I have no hand cards, so I can't use the consumables directly.\n\nI've got the `Constellation`, the plan is to find planets with the reroll. `Reroll_shop` it is!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
