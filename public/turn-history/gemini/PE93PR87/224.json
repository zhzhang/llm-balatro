{"reasoning":"**My Calculated Approach to Round 21**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 21 with a Big Blind of 75,000 chips and a measly $12. Got a decent Joker setup: Green Joker for a solid mult boost, Spare Trousers for Two Pair scaling, Certificate for utility, Luchador to disable the boss, Constellation for the big multiplier, and a Blue Joker for some chip padding. Need to hit 75,000 chips to move on.\n\nThe main strategy is built around High Card/Pair/Two Pair, with Spare Trousers being the key card if I can hit Two Pair. Joker order's optimal, with the Blue Joker adding chips first, followed by the additive mults (Green/Trousers), and then the multiplicative ones (Luchador/Constellation). My hand's currently: Ace, 5 (Blue Seal), King (Blue Seal), 4, 2 (Gold), Queen, 10 (Steel), 9 (Steel/Blue Seal), and another 4. I'm sitting on 4 hands and 4 discards.\n\nThe boss blind debuffs everything until I sell a Joker, so winning is the priority. I have a *pair* of 4s already, so let's aim for Two Pair to maximize Spare Trousers, but I should look out for pairs on the discards. I have some Blue Seal cards and Steel cards in hand, which are useful for scaling Constellation, and also useful for future planet cards. I should keep them.\n\nSo I need to discard the non-essential cards to find a Two Pair, preferably without losing the Blue Seal and Steel cards. I should play the 4s and the Steel/Blue Seals.\nMy goal now is to find another pair and make a Two Pair!\n\nI'll discard [Ace, Queen, 2 of Clubs].\n\nI'm keeping the pair, Blue Seal, and Steel cards for the multiplier effects, as well as the chance of a two pair, so I'll discard [Ace, Queen]. I have the perfect score for the 75,000.\nI'll discard [Ace, Queen] to fish for a Two Pair and win the round.\nOkay, discards done. \n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,6]"}
