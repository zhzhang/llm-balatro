{"reasoning":"Okay, let's see. Round 21, heading into Verdant Leaf. My immediate goal is to hit that 100k chip target for the boss blind. I've got $21, and the current game step is \"TAROT_PACK\" – I need to choose.\n\nThe boss, Verdant Leaf, is going to debuff all my cards until I sell a Joker. Luckily, I *have* Luchador, which is specifically designed to bypass boss blinds. It's a x1.5 Mult joker which is nice to have in general.\n\nI'm holding Green Joker (+26 Mult), Spare Trousers (+20 Mult), a Certificate, Luchador, Constellation (x3.9 Mult), and Blue Joker (+120 chips). I've got a Level 10 Pair, which is a key part of my strategy.\n\nMy options in this pack are Justice (Glass Card - x2 Mult), The Sun (Hearts), and The Hierophant (+30 chips). Since I'm focusing on Pairs, The Sun isn't great. The Hierophant is okay, but I'm leaning toward the potential of Justice.\n\nNow, with Verdant Leaf, that debuff is a real problem. Any enhancement I apply (Glass, Bonus, Steel) will be *useless* unless I sell a Joker. *But*, my plan is to sell Luchador to clear the debuff. So I can use enhancements.\n\nI have Steel cards in my hand already, and since my strategy is Pairs, that x1.5 Multiplier from those Steel cards will be helpful. The question is: *which* card in my hand is the best candidate for the Glass enhancement?\n\nI see an Ace of Hearts, Ace of Clubs (Steel), Queen of Spades, Queen of Hearts (best targets), and a few other cards. The Ace of Hearts (Position 3) or the Queen of Hearts (Position 4) look like the best options.\n\nSo, the plan: Choose Justice on the Ace of Hearts, Position 3. After the pack, I’ll decide *when* to sell Luchador – either right before Verdant Leaf or in the shop to be extra safe. Selling it *before* the boss typically works best in Balatro.\n\nSo, it's Justice (1) on Ace of Hearts (3).\n\nOkay, let's look at the hand again: Qs, 4s, Ah, Qh, Ac (Steel), 10c, Jd, 10d (Steel).\n\nThe plan is still: Select Justice on the Ace of Hearts in position 3. No, wait. Let's make sure. Okay, the Ace of Clubs is already steel. So are the 10 of Diamonds.\n\nLet's go for Justice on the Ace of Hearts, position 3.\n\nI'm thinking, is there any reason to take the Sun? No. And the Hierophant? No. x2 Mult is the best for this hand.\n\nFinal check on Justice: \"Enhances 1 selected card into a Glass Card\". Perfect.\n\nSo: `select 1 3`.\n\nI'm sure. I'm taking Justice (pack position 1) and enhancing the Ace of Hearts (hand position 3). That should be a real power boost! Let's get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,3]"}
