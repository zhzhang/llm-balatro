{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Joker Acquisition - Green Joker (Holo)**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Round 7, $30 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup, but it's time to optimize. I'm looking at the pack choices: Green Joker (Holographic) and Sixth Sense.\n\nLet's break down my current Jokers: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation, and Certificate. I have 6 Joker slots, but the Constellation's \"Negative\" status had me double-checking if it uses a slot - the UI says Max Jokers: 6, and I've now confirmed that I have 5 non-negative Jokers. The Constellation is Negative, but *also* provides an additional slot, bringing me to the current count of 6. Therefore, I have a slot available.\n\nThe **Green Joker (Holographic)** is immediately appealing. A Holographic edition provides a solid +10 Mult right off the bat, plus scaling with hands played and discards. It's a straight upgrade opportunity.\n\nSixth Sense is intriguing, but far more situational. Spectral cards are strong, but the requirement of playing a single 6 as my *first* hand is limiting and a significant scoring sacrifice. Green Joker's consistent bonus is too good to pass up.\n\nI'm definitely selling none of my current Jokers. My thoughts are:\n*   I can take Green Joker without selling anything!\n\nMy current plan is to take it. The command structure looks correct, `select 1`.\nI'm evaluating which Joker to sell later; in the long term, I might sell Smiley Face or Certificate or Mystic Summit, because +10 mult is immediately great. \n\nI'm now certain - Green Joker it is. I'm hitting `select 1`. Let's get this Holographic beauty!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
