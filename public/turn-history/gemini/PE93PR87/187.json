{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 7/8, Round 17. Big Blind is at 52.5k, Boss at 70k. My immediate goal is to maximize my score for these upcoming blinds. I've got $34 to work with in the shop. Looking at my current setup, I'm working with a constellation build that I am trying to build out more.\n\nI have a solid Joker lineup: Green Joker (+13 Mult, +10 holo = +23 Mult), Spare Trousers (+18 Mult), Certificate (card gen), Luchador (x1.5 Mult, Polychrome), Constellation (x3.0 Mult), and Blue Joker (+124 Chips). A Wild Card is my sole consumable. I am also running Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Grabber, and Hieroglyph vouchers.\n\nIn the shop, I'm seeing a Rough Gem for $7 which I'm ignoring because it's useless for this build. Then, an Arcana Pack for $4 is looking enticing because it has high potential value. It could contain High Priestess (planets for Constellation), Emperor (tarots), or other useful card modifiers.\n\nThe reroll costs $5 which is also in my budget.\n\nMy strategy here is pretty clear: **buy the Arcana Pack first.** That's the most likely path to immediate improvement.\n\nI have $34, so $4 for the Arcana Pack leaves me with $30.\n\nSo, I will buy the Arcana Pack first to see if it provides any immediate benefit or planet cards. I can check the deck state and the plan will be, again, the Arcana pack.\n\nAction: `buy_booster 1`\n\nI don't think it requires a target before opening, as the `buy_booster` command just opens the pack. No reroll at this stage, the Arcana pack is the priority. Checking for negative jokers, I have 5 standard slots + 1 negative = 6 jokers, which is the maximum, so I'm good there.\n\nAction: `buy_booster 1`\n\nAh, wait. I remember! I just bought the Jumbo Arcana Pack last turn and used it to create a Steel card (Chariot). Okay, so I am back in the shop. Makes sense. Therefore, the next logical step to improve the engine is the remaining Arcana Pack.\n\nAction: `buy_booster 1`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
