{"reasoning":"**Current State Assessment: Ante 2, Round 4 - Time to Crush This Blind**\n\nOkay, so the goal is 1600 chips, and I've got 4 hands left with zero discards – Mystic Summit is active, a major advantage. The Boss Blind, \"The Pillar\", debuffs previously played cards this ante, but I've already determined this shouldn't impact my main hand. I'm holding a debuffed 8 of Clubs, but the crucial cards (Kings and Aces) seem unaffected.\n\nMy hand is a Full House: Kings full of Aces (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) – perfect! Let's see... base score for a Full House at Level 1 is 40 chips and 4 mult. The cards themselves add 10+10+10+11+11 = 52 chips, giving a total of 92 chips.\n\nNow for the multipliers, which is where it gets interesting: Smiley Face is giving me +5 Mult for *each* face card, so that's 3 Kings * +5 = +15. Mystic Summit adds a further +15 Mult. So my additive mult is 4 + 15 + 15 = 34.\n\nMultiplicative effects come from Luchador (x1.5), Constellation (x1.1), and my Glass Ace (x2). Multiplying these gives 1.5 * 1.1 * 2 = 3.3. So, my final score calculation is 92 * 34 * 3.3.\n\nA quick check on my joker order: [Smiley, Summit, Luchador, Constellation]. It's optimized for the effects; independent effects from left to right.\n\nSelling Luchador isn't needed. I am likely to get 10k chips, and at a minimum 1.2k chips. So no need to sell to clear the boss.\n\nThe debuffed 8 of Clubs confirms that at least one 8 was played this Ante, but it doesn't seem to affect my current hand.\n\nSo, the play is simple: Play the Full House on positions [1, 3, 5, 6, 8]. The estimated final score is around 10,322, which is way over the goal. It's time to play.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6,8]"}
