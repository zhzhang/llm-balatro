{"reasoning":"**My Turn: SHOP Analysis**\n\nOkay, here we are at Ante 7/8, Round 18, the SHOP step. I've got $37 to work with, and a strong hand of Jokers: Green Joker is solid with its multiplier and Holo bonus; Spare Trousers gives a huge boost to Two Pair; Certificate provides great deck-building potential; Luchador is critical for disabling the final boss; Constellation is my scaling engine, and the Blue Joker gives a good initial chip boost.\n\nI also have two consumables, but the Judgement is useless to me right now as I have six jokers, I cannot create a new joker. Mercury is a level 8 Pair.\n\nIn the shop I have Smiley Face, Pluto, an Arcana Pack, and a Mega Standard Pack. Smiley Face seems useless as it buffs face cards and I'm facing a boss that debuffs them.\n\nMy immediate goal is to maximize my score this round and gear up for the final Ante. My Constellation joker is my primary scaling option, as it currently has X3.2 and increases with each Planet card played. Using Mercury and purchasing Pluto will trigger Constellation.\n\nI need to analyze my joker situation and decide if I should sell one. The Blue Joker, while useful for flat chips, seems like the weakest long-term. Green Joker's -1 discard isn't ideal, but the multiplier is good. Certificate and Luchador are great. I also have Trousers. No, I don't think I'll sell a joker right now.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\nFirst, I'll use Mercury, which levels my Pair to level 9 and immediately boosts Constellation to X3.3.\n\nNext, I'll buy and play Pluto for $3. This levels my High Card and further increases Constellation to X3.4.\n\nThen, for $4 I'll grab the Arcana Pack, because it's usually a good investment.\n\nFinally, I'll quickly re-evaluate if any of my Jokers need to be sold. I think I'm good, the current lineup is synergistic with scaling.\n\nMy action? `use_consumable` at position 2, that's Mercury. This will increase Pair Level and Constellation Mult. Constellation description shows \"This Joker gains X0.1 Mult every time a Planet card is used (Currently X3.2 Mult)\". Mercury is a planet card, so it will make the Constellation X3.3. Mercury also levels up Pair.\n\nOkay, next move is going to be another `use_consumable` at position 2.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
