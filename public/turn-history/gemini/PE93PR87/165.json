{"reasoning":"**Rerolling for Planetary Power**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. We're at Ante 6, Round 15, and in the Shop phase with $49 in the bank. I'm sitting pretty with a solid joker lineup: I've got the `Green Joker` adding +11 Mult, `Spare Trousers` with +14 Mult, the `Certificate` adding a random sealed card to my hand, `Luchador` providing x1.5 Mult and a Boss disabler, the temperamental `Constellation` at x2.8 Mult and scaling with Planets, and finally, `Blue Joker` which provides a massive +122 Chips. My hand levels are Three of a Kind (Lvl 9), Pair (Lvl 7), and Full House (Lvl 6) which is a strong position.\n\nMy main focus is that `Constellation` Joker. I need to find Planets to really make it sing. `Green Joker`, `Spare Trousers`, and `Blue Joker` give me a solid base, and `Luchador` provides both a Mult bonus and a Boss safety net. I've also got `The Lovers` consumable, which I haven't even used yet.\n\nLooking at the Shop, `Blackboard` seems tempting with its x3 Mult for Spades/Clubs hands, but it's too restrictive for my current setup. I've got `Certificate` throwing random cards into the mix and `The Lovers` allowing for flexible hand plays, and it's not worth sacrificing a Joker for it given the current constraints. `Hit the Road` is too inconsistent, relying on discarding Jacks, and `Wasteful` would actually *hurt* my `Green Joker`.\n\nI have plenty of cash and can comfortably afford the $6 reroll cost. The shop, unfortunately, has no Planets or packs. I'm prioritizing the scaling of `Constellation`. I'm going to keep searching for those Planets, or maybe even Celestial or Arcana packs to find Planets.\n\nThe decision is clear: reroll the shop. Although `Luchador` is useful, it's not a must-keep given my strategy, especially since I need to find Planets ASAP. I'll stick to scaling `Constellation` for now.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
