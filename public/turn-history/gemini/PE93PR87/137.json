{"reasoning":"**Rerolling for Planetary Power**\n\nOkay, so we're in Ante 5/8, Round 13. The SHOP phase is upon us, and I have $55 to work with. My Joker lineup is pretty solid: Green Joker for a nice mult boost, Spare Trousers for Two Pair scaling, Certificate for extra cards, Luchador for a Polychrome multiplier, Constellation, which is key due to its negative effect and Planet card scaling, and a Blue Joker for some chips. No consumables yet, but I have space. My vouchers are the Tarot Merchant, Grabber, and Hieroglyph, which could prove useful.\n\nThe shop itself offers Justice (a Tarot card that enhances another to Glass, with a chance of breaking) and a Standard Pack. Not ideal. Justice is tempting but risky, and while more cards are always welcome, planets are my top priority, given Constellation's power. My primary strategy is based around Planet cards and Two Pair, and right now, Planets are the clear focus.\n\nI see that `buy_card 1` (Justice) costs $3, and `buy_booster 1` (Standard Pack) costs $4. But right now, neither helps my core strategy. A reroll costs $5, which is easily affordable.\n\nConsidering the Constellation is at a nice x2.3 mult, and I have $55, finding Planets or Celestial Packs *immediately* is the best path to long-term scaling. The current shop doesn't have any planets in it, which is the main target, so I need to find something else. Therefore:\n\nMy best move is clear: `reroll_shop`. I can afford it, and it's the most direct route to find the cards I need to really make Constellation shine. So, that's the action I'll take.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
