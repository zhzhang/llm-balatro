{"reasoning":"**Navigating a Critical Blind Select**\n\nOkay, so I'm in a tricky spot. Blind Select, Ante 2/8, Big Blind - 1200 chips. I've got a single dollar to my name. The Ethereal Tag, a *Spectral Pack*, is staring me in the face as an option to skip. It's a tempting choice, especially with the Boss Blind up next: \"The Pillar\", which debuffs cards I play in this Ante. I've got a Certificate joker that adds a random sealed card at the start of each round, and my current jokers are: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Luchador, Constellation, and the Certificate.\n\nMy gut says the Spectral Pack is the higher-value play in the long run. These packs can be insane, yielding game-breaking cards. I'm thinking of cards like Immolate, Ankh, or Hex, cards that are almost always worth more than a quick $4 and a shop visit. On the other hand, playing nets me that immediate $4, which I desperately need, a card via Certificate, and another shop.\n\nBut wait, The Pillar only debuffs cards from this *Ante*. I already played a hand in the Small Blind. I already lost those cards to The Pillar. The question becomes, do I play *more* cards in this hand, cards that will *also* get debuffed for the Boss Blind?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. If I skip, I go straight to the Boss Blind with $1, and get a Spectral Pack. The Boss reward is $5, giving me a total of $6. If I play, I get $4, plus the sealed card, plus a shop visit, taking me to $5, and the Boss reward is another $5, totaling $10 (plus the potential to increase the hands played after).\n\nThe Spectral Pack is the more strategic choice *if* it gives me a significant power boost. The money situation is making me sweat, but those Spectral cards are often better than a quick injection of cash. However, I have that Certificate, which is a key part of my engine. I need to make the best possible choice here.\n\nReconsidering...if I *play*, I get the Certificate effect *and* the shop. If I *skip*, I get the pack and *no* shop. Spectral packs can be risky, especially if they make me destroy valuable cards. But this is the \"Ethereal Tag\", so I get a *choice*. Okay, I'm leaning heavily towards the Spectral Pack now.\n\nLet me reassess the Boss Blind, again. With Mystic Summit, Luchador, and Smiley, I can reach 1600 if I have a decent hand. Luchador can be sold to disable the boss if things go south.\n\nYes, Spectral Packs have the higher upside. Skipping seems like the best move.\n\nJust quickly...re-ordering the jokers? No. +Mult first, then xMult. Certificate position is irrelevant.\n\n**Action: skip_round.**\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
