{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Boss Fight - Ante 2, Round 5**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm facing the Ante 2 boss with a 1600 chip requirement. My hand's looking strong, with a Full House at Level 3 (90x8), a Three of a Kind at Level 2 (50x5), and a Pair at Level 2 (25x3) available if I need them. I've got a decent amount of money to start. I have the \"Investment Tag\" active, which will net me $25 after this round.\n\nThe boss effect is drawing 7 cards face down. The key question is whether to sell my Luchador joker, which can disable the boss effect. But is it necessary? 1600 chips is easily achievable. My last Full House scored well over 6000 and even my Two Pair scored nearly 900. With Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, and the polychrome multiplier from Luchador and Constellation, I'm confident I can reach 1600 even if I have to play a low-scoring hand. Selling Luchador would remove its Polychrome multiplier. That seems counterproductive.\n\nMy Joker setup is: Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards), Mystic Summit (+15 Mult at 0 discards), Spare Trousers (+2 Mult for Two Pair), Luchador (Polychrome X1.5 Mult), Constellation (Negative, X1.4 Mult), and Certificate (Adds sealed card each round). The additive jokers (Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers) are correctly positioned before the multiplicative ones (Luchador, Constellation), following the correct order of operations. No need to rearrange.\n\nConsidering the \"Order of Operations\" rules for the game, I'm already in the optimal order for applying my Jokers. There is no need to sell Luchador.\n\nMy current action is `play_round`. So, let's start this boss fight.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
