{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5, Round 12, with $17 in the bank. This is the shop phase. Time to assess the situation and optimize.\n\nFirst, the Jokers. I've got a solid lineup: Green Joker (scaling mult), Spare Trousers (more mult on Two Pair), Certificate (utility – random card or seal), Luchador (boss disable and multiplicative multiplier), Constellation (multiplicative multiplier and +1 Joker slot – this is key), and Blue Joker (massive chip boost). Six Jokers, six slots – looks like I'm maxed out thanks to Constellation, even though it's technically a negative Joker.\n\nNow for the shop itself. \"Shoot the Moon\" offers +13 mult per Queen, but that's unreliable since I rely on Certificate for generating random cards. \"Ice Cream\" provides a chip boost, but Blue Joker already has me covered. Both are $5. Rerolling is also $5, and that could yield planets for Constellation, which would be ideal. I could potentially get two rerolls.\n\nThe question is, do I buy anything or save? The shop cards aren't screaming \"must-have.\" I can't afford any of them without selling, and that seems detrimental. I need Planets, I need Two Pair, I need hands played. It might be better to move to the round selection screen, but the opportunity cost is high.\n\nMy mult calculation is (Base + 18 + 10) * 1.5 * 2.3 = (Base + 28) * 3.45. If my base mult is 6 from a Pair, that would be 117.3 mult. Plus my chips. This could easily get me through this round.\n\nRerolling would be my top priority in other instances, but I'll see what the next round has to offer.\n\nLet's quickly check the Joker order. Blue Joker gets the chips, Green and Spare Trousers get the additive mults, and Luchador and Constellation are the multiplicative multipliers. My slots are in the correct order.\n\nI could try a reroll to improve Constellation. The description for Luchador is bugged, but I know how it works. And now I've reviewed, I can confirm that Constellation is indeed a negative Joker *but* also adds a joker slot. That's unusual. It's got me at maximum capacity.\n\nI have $17. The optimal play is to go to `round_select`. Let's do that.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
