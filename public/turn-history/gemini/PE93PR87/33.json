{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: Tarot Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this Tarot Pack decision. The immediate goal is to maximize chips to progress past Ante 3. We're in the shop phase, specifically looking at the Arcana Pack, with only $5 currently.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup: Smiley Face (Face cards), Mystic Summit (0 Discards), Luchador (Polychrome, X1.5), Constellation (Planet multiplier, Negative, but +1 slot), and Certificate (Seal). Selling these Jokers would net me $17. We can hold a maximum of 6 Jokers currently. Constellation's negative effect adds a joker but reduces its effect.\n\nNow, looking at the choices:\n\n1.  **Judgement:** A random Joker. High variance, could be great or awful. While I do have space for a joker after the Negative Constellation, I am leaning against it due to its random nature.\n2.  **Temperance:** This is very tempting. It grants $17, which would bring me to $22. This is potentially a game-changing amount of money to buy vouchers, interest, or booster packs.\n3.  **The Fool:** Duplicates Justice (which creates a Glass Card). I am already scoring pretty well with my current setup. Justice does give a strong card, but I do not need it as desperately as Temperance.\n\nI have $5. Temperance ($17) is a guaranteed economic boost, leading to a total of $22. Hieroglyph costs $10, which means I can afford it with the Temperance pack and remain in Ante 2. This would offer additional scaling opportunities and more shops for Constellation. Judgement is less valuable due to its randomness and common joker value of $2. The Fool is decent, but I'm scoring well with current hands and I can take a financial approach with Temperance.\n\nTherefore, the best option is Temperance. This secures financial stability early in the game. I can afford the Hieroglyph voucher for $10, giving me more shop opportunities and enabling me to scale Constellation further.\n\nI have to double-check the command is \"select 2\" based on the documentation, which seems correct. Since it's an Arcana Pack choice, no hand positions are needed. I don't need to specify a hand to use Temperance.\n\nBased on everything I've seen, it seems I'm still on Ante 3 as of this turn, despite the prompt's reference to Ante 2. The $5 is confirmed from the previous shop purchase. Temperance will give me $22, which is more reliable than a random card (Judgement) or a single-use card (The Fool).\n\nI am confident. I will choose Temperance.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
