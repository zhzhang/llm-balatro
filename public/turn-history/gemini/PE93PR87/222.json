{"reasoning":"**Current Balatro Decision-Making Process**\n\nOkay, here we are in Ante 8, Round 20, Big Blind incoming. Time to strategize. I've got $12, which isn't a ton but enough to make some moves. My Joker setup is decent: Green Joker (+16 base, +10 holo), Spare Trousers (+20 mult and scaling), Certificate (utility), Luchador (x1.5 polychrome), Constellation (x3.8 scaling), and Blue Joker (+134 chips).\n\nThe shop offers a Hiker, Fortune Teller (+27 Mult), a Standard Pack, a Hone voucher, and a $5 reroll. The Judgement consumable is useless right now since my Joker slots are full, although I could sell it for $1. The big question is how to get ready for the 75,000 Big Blind. I've been hitting around 80k-90k lately, so I *should* be alright.\n\nFortune Teller looks tempting to replace Green Joker since 27 is better than 26, but the Green Joker's holo bonus is nice and then there's Spare Trousers that scales. But I only have $12, so buying something means selling. The Standard Pack might give me a better card. I also keep thinking about Constellation, which would be better with more planets. I did recently play Uranus for that x3.8 bonus. \n\nOkay, I could reroll and *hope* for a planet, but that's a gamble. A reroll and a planet would cost $8 and leave me with $4, so probably not. If I *do* sell a Joker, Judgement goes from useless to a potential $1 boost. But it makes little difference. Even the Hone voucher is bad since it is a late-game voucher, and this run is almost over.\n\nI’m pretty sure I have enough power to clear the Big Blind already. Let's see... a simple Pair with my current setup: (56 + 130 chip base) * (1.5 * 3.8) = 84k, so I am good for now.\n\nConsidering my options, the most efficient move seems to be skipping the shop and moving onto the round select, saving my money and collecting $2 interest with $10 in the bank (which I have already).\n\nSo, final answer: Next round. Let's do `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
