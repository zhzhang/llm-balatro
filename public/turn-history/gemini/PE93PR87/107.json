{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Ante 4, Round 10 - Play the Round**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 4, Round 10, big blind. The immediate goal is to hit 7,500 chips, which, given the Ante, should be achievable in a round or two. The reward is $4, which is okay, but more importantly, skipping gives me a D6 Tag. However, a free reroll tag isn't *that* valuable right now. I'm better off playing.\n\nI have some solid Jokers in play: Green Joker (+4 mult, scales with hands), Mystic Summit (+15 mult with 0 discards), Spare Trousers (+4 mult, scales with Two Pair), Certificate (adds a card with a seal), Luchador (can disable the Boss Blind *and* it's Polychrome, x1.5 multiplier), and Constellation (x2.2 mult, scales with Planets, and it's Negative, meaning an extra slot cost). I also have The Chariot consumable, a Steel Card enhancement.\n\nI need to maximize my scaling. Skipping misses out on round reward, interest ($5), Green Joker growth, Spare Trousers scaling, and the Certificate effect at the round start (which I almost missed!). Also, consumables are useless in the Blind Select phase, so I can't use The Chariot right now.\n\nThe upcoming Boss is \"The Window,\" which debuffs Diamond cards. I *could* sell Luchador to disable this, but it’s the Polychrome version, losing a x1.5 multiplier. I should wait and see how Diamond-heavy my hand is before selling.\n\nBefore I play, I must check my Joker order. Additive multipliers should be to the left of Multiplicative ones. My current order is: Green, Mystic, Spare, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation. Good. Additive, Multiplicative, fine.\n\n*Wait*, let me check Luchador’s description. Ah, the Polychrome edition grants x1.5 mult *because* it’s Polychrome. This means I'm not sacrificing the base multiplier by selling. I'll remember this.\n\nMy last hand was around 6,200. I can easily beat the round target of 7,500.\n\nSo, the action is definitely to `play_round`. I need to generate the JSON payload, which will just be the `action` field. No reordering is required. No need to sell or do anything else right now. Let's get this round going!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
