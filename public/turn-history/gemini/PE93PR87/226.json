{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Final Boss Approach**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 8, Round 21. Big Blind is down, and it's time to prep for the Verdant Leaf boss. The goal? Crush this final boss and lock in the win! I've got $25 to work with, which isn't a huge amount, but I can make it work.\n\nVerdant Leaf is a tricky one; \"All cards debuffed until 1 Joker sold\". However, I've got Luchador! Selling it, *completely* disables the Blind. This is perfect. Let's see...I should confirm if I sell Luchador *before* or *during* the round. It says \"Sell this card to disable the current Boss Blind\", so the shop is fine. I'll remember I can use it anytime.\n\nFirst, I have to think about how I can boost my multipliers before the boss. I have a Green Joker at +26 Mult (currently +16 + 10), Spare Trousers (+20 Mult), a Certificate, Luchador (x1.5 Mult), Constellation (x3.8 Mult), and a Blue Joker (+136 Chips). Plus, I have Judgement (random Joker) and Mercury (Pair Level Up). My main hand is Pair, and it is at Level 9.\n\nI need 100,000 chips. I have $25 to spend, and my main focus is on *Constellation*, since it's at x3.8 and increases with each planet used. I have to think, how do I get Constellation up even *more*?\n\nFirst, I have to use Mercury. It will level up my Pair to level 10 and increase Constellation from x3.8 to x3.9. I'll execute that first, since it is a pure benefit, and I have it in slot 2 of my Consumables. Let's go: `use_consumable 2`.\n\nNow, what else can I do? $25… I should buy an Arcana Pack ($4) to see if I can find another planet card, like an Emperor. Then, I can reroll for more planet cards. Hone is useless, and the Golden Joker or Superposition are not useful for a final boss run. A Jumbo Standard Pack is too limited in its impact.\n\nFinally, I have to make the decision about Luchador. Should I sell it now, or wait until the Blind is active? Selling Luchador *disables* the blind, but I can sell *any* Joker to satisfy the \"1 Joker sold\" condition. Given that the main point is to disable the blind, I want to sell Luchador so that the boss does not affect any of my cards. The x1.5 Multiplier from Luchador is also very attractive, but in this situation, it is better to eliminate the downside.\n\nOkay, here's the plan. I'll hit that Mercury and then buy the Arcana pack. Let's get this done!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
