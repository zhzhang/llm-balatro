{"reasoning":"**The Plan: Verdant Leaf Boss Fight**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Final boss, Verdant Leaf, ante 8/8. I need 100,000 chips.  The debuff is lifted, and I've got a decent hand, plus some good Jokers in play. My current Jokers are: Green Joker (+26 Mult), Spare Trousers (+20 Mult), Certificate (adds random seal), Constellation (x4 Mult), Blue Joker (+122 Chips), and Splash (all cards count).\n\nThe strategy is clear:  I've got a `Magician` consumable that can enhance two cards to Lucky. I need to figure out which cards to enhance.  The best candidates are the cards with Red Seals. I've got a Queen of Spades with a Red Seal and a Six of Clubs with a Red Seal.  I'm thinking a Two Pair hand will be best, so I'll aim to create a Two Pair with Aces and 8s, along with the Queen.\n\nI have a Two Pair of Aces and 8s. Let's see...  If I play a Two Pair with the Queen of Spades (Lucky/Red Seal), Splash is active, the Red Seal triggers on the Queen, and I will be over 100k. I already know that I have an easy win. Spare Trousers should provide +2 mult and Green Joker should have increased mult for each hand.\n\nOkay, time to act. First, I need to use the consumable.  The correct command is `use_consumable`. I need to use the Magician on the Queen of Spades and the Six of Clubs to change them into Lucky cards.\nThe optimal Joker order: Green (+26 Mult) and Spare (+20 Mult) are before Constellation (x4), and Blue Joker (+122) adds chips. `Splash` has no ordering effect and `Certificate` has no effect here.\nSo the JSON command is: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 2, 7]}`. Easy win.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,2,7]"}
