{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Play: A Two-Pair Strategy**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 8, Round 22. The goal is a hefty 100,000 chips.  Verdant Leaf, the boss, is out of the picture now, and the Luchador debuff is thankfully gone – confirmed by checking those card descriptions. We have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nI've got a decent Joker spread:  Green Joker for the base mult (+26 currently, +10 Holo), Spare Trousers (+20 currently, +2 for Two Pair), a Certificate, Constellation for that x4 mult boost, a Blue Joker for a big chip injection (+122), and finally Splash, ensuring every card played contributes. My hand: Queen of Spades (Lucky/Red Seal), 6 of Clubs (Lucky/Red Seal), Ace of Spades, Jack of Spades (Gold Seal), 8 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, 6 of Diamonds, and 4 of Diamonds.\n\nThe best play here is clearly a Two Pair hand: Aces and 8s.  Let's see the math on that.\n\nI'm thinking of playing the Aces (3 and 6), the 8s (5 and 7), and the Queen of Spades (1) to trigger that Splash bonus, getting all cards to score. I am going for a Two Pair hand.\n\n*   Hand: Two Pair.\n*   The base is 80 chips and 5 mult (Level 4).\n*   Joker Mult: Green (+26), Spare Trousers (+20, +2 for the Two Pair) = +22. That gets us to 53 additive mult.\n*   Joker Chips: +122 (Blue Joker), plus base of 80 = 202 total chips.\n*   Card Chips: Ace of Spades and Hearts at +11 each, 8 of Spades and 8 of Clubs at +8 each, and the Queen of Spades with +10 plus a potential double retrigger from the Red Seal. That is a solid +58 total chip value.\n*   My total Chips will be at 260.\n*   The mult from Constellation will get us x4.\n*   Total Multiplicative: 212.\n*   The estimate for the Total is 55,120.\n\nHold on... I need to hit 100,000. Looks like two hands will be the play.\n\n*   Hand: Pair (Aces).\n*   Base chips: 145 and 11 mult (Level 10).\n*   My chips would be: 331\n*   Mult: 11 + 26 = 37.\n*   Multiplier from Constellation: 148\n*   My total would be at 48,988.\n\nTwo Pair is better due to the Spare Trousers (+2).\n\nAlright, let's see, what did I score with a Pair on previous rounds? 99k? Why the disparity? Hmmm... Maybe the Green Joker and Spare Trousers were higher? Looks like the state from the previous turn would not change the cards, so it's most likely due to the cards I had then. I'm confident now.\n\nIf a Pair scores ~50k-90k, and I have 4 hands, this is a sure win.\n\nJoker Order: Green(1), Spare(2), Certificate(3), Constellation(4), Blue(5), Splash(6). Good. Chips are added before Mult is calculated, and I want that x4 mult boost at the very end. This is the optimal order.\n\nMy Action is to play Two Pair (Aces and 8s) and make sure the Queen of Spades comes along.\n\n*   Cards: Ace of Spades, Ace of Hearts, 8 of Spades, 8 of Clubs, Queen of Spades (Red Seal Lucky).\n*   Hand Type: two pair.\n*   Estimated chips: I am aiming for 55k chips this turn.\n\nLet me just double-check Splash here: \"Every played card counts in scoring.\" This is great. Even if I played a High Card, all the cards' chip values and effects apply.\n\nRefined Estimate:\n\n*   Chips: Base (80) + Blue Joker (122) + Aces (22) + 8s (16) + Queen (10) + Re-trigger (10) = 260.\n*   Mult\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6,7]"}
