{"reasoning":"**Current Decision Point: Boss Blind Selection**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 13, facing the \"Boss Blind\" transition. The game step is currently `BLIND_SELECT`, meaning I need to choose my approach. The Boss this round is \"The Arm\", which, as the description confirms, decreases the level of the *played* poker hand. I'm starting with a paltry $23 and need to reach 22,000 chips.\n\nMy hand consists of the following Jokers:\n\n*   Green Joker (Holo): +9 base mult + +10 holo mult, totaling +19 mult, and gains +1 mult per hand and loses -1 per discard.\n*   Spare Trousers: +12 mult, gaining +2 per Two Pair.\n*   Certificate: Adds a random sealed card at the start of the round.\n*   Luchador (Polychrome): x1.5 mult and can be sold to disable the Boss Blind.\n*   Constellation (Negative): x2.4 mult, gaining x0.1 per Planet used.\n*   Blue Joker: +118 chips.\n\nI also have two consumables: The Lovers (which enhances a card to be Wild), and Strength (+1 rank to two cards).\n\nThe critical decision here is whether to keep or sell Luchador. Selling it disables The Arm's effect, but I lose the x1.5 multiplier. To clarify, The Arm's effect happens *after* the hand scores, which means the first hand I play is scored at its current level. This means I can afford to play a single hand and win this round with a high-enough multiplier.\n\nLet's do some quick calculations. A Three of a Kind at Level 7 (150 chips, 15 mult) plus the Blue Joker gives me 268 chips. The base mult is (15) + (19) + (12) and then it's multiplied by x1.5 and x2.4 which results in a score of around 44,220 which easily clears the blind.\n\nSo, I don't need to sell Luchador to win the blind. I should be able to play one hand, beat the blind, then deal with the level decrease in the next round. The level-down will hit me *after* this round.\n\nRegarding Joker order and when bonuses get applied: I need to make sure the additive multipliers are processed *before* the multiplicative ones. My current setup is: Green Joker (+19), Spare Trousers (+12), Certificate, Luchador (x1.5), Constellation (x2.4), and Blue Joker (+118 chips).\n\nBased on the order of operations, the setup is correct and the math is (Base Multiplier + 19 + 12) * 1.5 * 2.4 + 118 chips. This means:\n\n1.  Boss Blind\n2.  On played Jokers\n3.  Played Cards score (Base chips + Blue Joker chips)\n4.  Held-in-hand bonuses\n5.  Independent Jokers (Green, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation)\n\nI shouldn't worry about using Lovers or Strength yet, as I need to be in the \"Round\" phase to do so, where I have cards.\n\nTherefore, the only viable action is to proceed by selecting `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
