{"reasoning":"**Strategic Hand Selection: Round 6, Ante 2**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. We're in Round 6, Ante 2, aiming to beat \"The Pillar\" blind. 1600 chips are the goal, and I'm starting at zero. We have 3 hands and 3 discards left, plus $5.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate my hand and inventory. The Jokers are key: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation, and a Certificate. The Hieroglyph voucher is also relevant. My hand is: K♠, Q♠, A♣, Q♣, 6♣, 9♦, 8♦, 5♦. I have Full House (Level 3), Pair (Level 2), and Three of a Kind (Level 2) hand levels available.\n\nMy immediate focus has to be maximizing the Mystic Summit's +15 mult bonus for 0 discards. That requires me to discard and redraw. Also, that Ace of Clubs, which creates a Tarot card when discarded, is just too good to pass up. I have no consumables, so this will be an immediate benefit.\n\nThe current plan is to use all discards to get 0 discards left, trigger Mystic Summit. I should then hopefully have a decent scoring hand. I will hold that 9♦ until the final hand for a Planet card.\n\nNow for the discard phase. I have 3 discards to play with, so:\n\n*   Discard the Ace of Clubs (pos 3), to get a Tarot card, and three junk cards: 6♣, 8♦, and 5♦ (pos 5, 7, and 8). That way I'll have all 0 discards.\n*   That will use one discard, leaving two.\n\nIf I discard pos 3, 5, 7, 8:\n*   Remaining cards in hand: 1, 2, 4, 6.\n*   I will draw 4 new cards.\n*   Remaining discards: 2.\n\nAfter the discard, I will draw new cards.\nNow, the key will be to get to the 0 discards for the Mystic Summit multiplier. I'll get that Tarot card, which is an immediate benefit.\n\nIn the previous turn's discussion, an \"Unknown\" card was mentioned, which I should keep in mind. The \"face down\" effect for the boss fight relates to drawn cards.\n\nThe action is to discard pos 3, 5, 7, and 8.\n\nI see that I need to plan ahead and see if a single play is possible. Level 2 Three of a Kind with the Mystic Summit Joker can produce 50+10+10+10 base chips with a multiplier of 35. This would easily exceed the 1600 chips needed.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,5,7,8]"}
