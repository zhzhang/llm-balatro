{"reasoning":"**My Strategy: Ante 8, The Verdant Leaf**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 8, and the upcoming boss is \"The Verdant Leaf.\" This boss is going to debuff all my cards until I sell a Joker. I've got a solid set of Jokers: a Green Joker for flat mult, Spare Trousers for scaling mult with Two Pair, a Certificate (which I'll need to trigger this round), Luchador (which *can* disable the boss), Constellation (a powerful x-mult), and a Blue Joker for chip generation. I'm currently sitting on six dollars, but I'm consistently hitting the necessary thresholds for the Small Blind.\n\nMy primary goal is to *win* this game, so I need to beat this Boss Blind. Luchador is the key here; its ability directly counters the boss's debuff. The Investment Tag for $25 after the boss round is tempting, but the *real* priority right now is disabling the boss. Since Luchador disables the boss, I think I need to just sell it at the start of the Boss round.\n\nSkipping the Small Blind for the $25 isn't ideal because I'll miss out on scaling Green Joker and Spare Trousers, plus the Certificate trigger and round interest. My last hands were in the 50k-70k range, so I'm well within hitting the Small Blind's requirement of 50k. Plus, my hand levels are solid: Three of a Kind at 11, Pair at 9, and Full House at 6.\n\nI've considered skipping the Small Blind for the $25 Investment Tag, but since I must defeat the final boss, I need to focus on building up my Jokers. This final tag doesn't even trigger until *after* the Boss, so it's useless for winning the game!\n\nThe priority is to *play* the round. I'll get to scale Green Joker and Spare Trousers, trigger Certificate, and earn a bit of extra cash through hands and interest. The boss debuff will be instantly neutralized with Luchador.\n\nNow, let's make sure my Jokers are in the *right* order. I need to stack as much mult as possible before the x-mult jokers (Luchador, Constellation). Blue Joker's position isn't as critical in this setup since it just adds chips, and the x-mult jokers work by multiplying the total mult, not the jokers directly to the left.\n\nThe current order of my Jokers is perfect: Green Joker (flat mult), Spare Trousers (scaling flat mult), Certificate, Luchador (x1.5), Constellation (x3.7), and Blue Joker (+132 chips).\n\n**Therefore, the correct action is: `play_round`.**\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
