{"reasoning":"**Decision Time in the Celestial Pack**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the Planet Pack selection screen. The goal is Ante 6, and I've got $58 to play with. The core strategy is clear: level up that *Constellation* Joker, which currently sits at x2.6 Mult, by leveraging these planet cards. Each planet card I use gives +0.1x to `Constellation`. Let's break down the options.\n\n*   **Pluto**: High Card. Level 2. I play it pretty often, especially when I don't have good hands. It's safe, but the scaling isn't great.\n*   **Jupiter**: Flush. Level 2. Potentially good, especially if I can get some suit density going. It's a solid secondary scoring option (I have been playing it!).\n*   **Neptune**: Straight Flush. Level 2. Too rare to be reliable right now, even if it's the highest scaling.\n\nI've been playing a lot of `High Card`, `Pair`, and `Two Pair` recently, especially to advance the `Green Joker`. My `Three of a Kind` (at level 9 from Venus!) hand is strong, and `Spare Trousers` means `Two Pair` could be good. However, `Flush` (Level 2) is currently also active.\n\nLet's see: `Jupiter` (Flush) or `Pluto` (High Card) for now. Since `Flush` level-ups are generally better, even if I play `High Card` more, and I just played a `High Card` to win last round, I lean towards `Jupiter`.\n\n*   `Constellation` will be X2.7 mult.\n*   Checking the hand levels, I'll pick `Jupiter` (Position 2), since it is a secondary scoring hand.\n\nI'm double-checking the schema. It needs to be valid JSON. I select `Jupiter`, which is position 2 in the pack.\n\nThe schema has no real requirements. `Intended_hand_type` doesn't matter since I am selecting a planet card. Setting it to `null`. It will increment the *Constellation* Joker. I re-read the state of the game: This is a solid choice. The `Certificate` could make `Flush` even better.\n\nNo reason to choose `Neptune` (Straight Flush) or `Pluto` (High Card).\n`Jupiter` (Flush) is best.\n\nSo, the final structure:\n\n```json\n{\"action\":\"select\",\"positions\":[2],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
