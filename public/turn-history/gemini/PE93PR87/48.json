{"reasoning":"**My Shop Phase Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 2, Round 5, and I'm sitting on $9. My hand is a Full House, which is at level 3, and my build is pretty solid: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation, and Certificate. I'm maxed out on Jokers at 6/6 (though Constellation effectively makes it 5/5 + 1) and consumables (0/2), and my Constellation joker's multiplier currently at x1.3, scaling with planets.\n\nI have a few options in the shop: a Celestial Pack, an Egg, and a Sly Joker. I could also reroll, but that seems like a gamble at this point.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking about this: My primary focus right now has to be maximizing the scaling of Constellation. Buying and using the Celestial Pack is the clear play. It costs $4, leaving me with $5 afterward. The immediate benefit is increasing Constellation's multiplier to x1.4. Also, it levels up a hand. The Egg is tempting for the long term, but right now, I need the boost from the Celestial Pack to maximize my scoring potential this round. Sly Joker is decent, but my slots are tight, and I'm happy with my build. Reroll is too costly.\n\nSo, the optimal action here is `buy_booster` at position 1, which contains the Celestial Pack. It's the most impactful play to immediately increase my Constellation scaling.\n\nThe reasoning is pretty straightforward: **Prioritize Constellation Scaling - Buy Celestial Pack**. The Celestial Pack is the best move to achieve this strategy.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
