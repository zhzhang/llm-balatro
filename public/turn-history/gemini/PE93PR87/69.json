{"reasoning":"**Analysis Complete: Flush is the Optimal Play**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 3, Small Blind, need 2000 chips. I’ve got one discard already used, but two more discards to spare. I've got a decent hand: 1:JC, 2:6C, 3:4C, 4:KD, 5:QD, 6:JD, 7:9D, 8:2D.\n\nImmediately, I see a Flush: Diamonds (KD, QD, JD, 9D, 2D). I've got a few Jokers to help me out: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation, and a Certificate. I also have a Justice consumable.\n\nIf I play the Flush as is, the math shakes out. The Flush itself will be worth 76 chips. With the Smiley Face Joker adding +5 mult to each face card and an additional Mult based on base level, the math ends up around 3898 chips. Easily clears the requirement with the Luchador and Constellation multipliers.\n\nNow, do I want to play around with other options? If I played a Pair of Jacks, it's possible. However, the estimated chips are way less.\n\nDo I use the Justice card? The Justice card would double one card, but it's not needed to clear the 2000-chip goal. I might save it for a later round or a boss.\n\nDiscarding to trigger Mystic Summit (+15 mult) is an option, but that does more work than needed. Plus, I would have to discard some cards from the Flush. Since the goal is to get to the shop efficiently, winning in one hand is best. I'm going to save my discards.\n\nLet's quickly check the Joker order. Smiley, Mystic, Spare Trousers, Luchador, Constellation looks right since they go from additive to multiplicative.\n\nSo, the optimal play is the Flush: KD, QD, JD, 9D, 2D. Indices 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Play those cards as a Flush. Estimated chips: 3898. That should be a clean win and get me to the shop.\n\nI still need to double-check that the \"intended_hand_type\" enum is valid in this action, so I'll verify \"flush\". Final check: Yep, 3898 is greater than 2000. It's go time. I will save Justice and skip discard to just play the hand.\n\nOne final check on the cards: 4: KD, 5: QD, 6: JD, 7: 9D, 8: 2D. Perfect. The numbers check out. And the JSON code is below.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 3898\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
