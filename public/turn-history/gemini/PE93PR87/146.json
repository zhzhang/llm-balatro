{"reasoning":"**The Strategic Mindset of a Balatro Expert**\n\nAlright, here's the situation: Ante 6, round 14. Just finished that tough Ante 5 Boss. Money's at $39, and the goal is to conquer the Ante 8 Boss. My inventory is stacked with Jokers: Green Joker at +20 Mult, Spare Trousers with +12 Mult for Two Pair, a Certificate (utility), Luchador (Polychrome, x1.5 Mult, boss-disabling potential), Constellation (Negative, x2.4 Mult, Planet scaling), and a Blue Joker, adding +120 Chips. Consumables are The Lovers (Wild) and Strength (+Rank). The Shop's offering Even Steven ($4), Wily Joker ($4), Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6), a Standard Pack ($4), and a Wasteful Voucher (+$1 discard, $10). My hand levels are Three of a Kind (level 7), Pair (level 5), Full House (level 4), and a Flush (level 1, thanks to \"The Arm\" boss effect).\n\nThe core strategy here is clear: Constellation's multiplicative Mult scaling needs Planets to truly shine. Money's looking healthy right now, but I want to make the most of it. Interest tops out at $25, so I can spend $14 before losing that. Those shop cards, Even Steven and Wily Joker, are not improvements on what I have, and Wasteful isn’t a priority. The Jumbo Arcana Pack is the best bet here: at $6, it might deliver a Priestess, which creates Planets (needed for Constellation). It could also give an Emperor (tarots) that might lead to a Priestess.\n\nMy mind is now focused on optimizing for Constellation. No Planets are visible in the shop now, but a reroll could change that. I've got $39, and a reroll costs $5. Buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack costs $6, which would leave me with $33. I need to think this through carefully.\n\nSince I have consumables, I might want to use or sell them *before* opening a pack in case the pack gives me something valuable (like the Priestess). Actually, buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack immediately *uses* it, so the consumables aren't an issue *until* I choose cards *from* the pack.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The Arcana Pack is $6. Potential scenario: I find a Priestess, get 2 Planets. That's a huge boost. Emperor could yield more Tarots which could be even more Priestess or something else. I might get Hermit and get money. Temperance gives money ($18) with a sell. I have to think about the action, and I'm deciding to just buy the pack. I'm well ahead of where I need to be, but I want to *stay* ahead.\n\nThe current Mult is (Base + 32) * 1.5 * 2.4. Current Chips are (Base + 120). For Three of a Kind (level 7), that works out to (150 + 120) * (15 + 32) * 3.6 = 45,684. Ante 6 Small Blind is usually around 30k-40k, Big Blind is around 50k-60k. It's safe to say I can scale further, so I will prioritize scaling.\n\nOkay, should I buy Wasteful? Well, I get +1 discard. Discards are useful for hand flexibility, but the Green Joker loses mult on discard. I haven't discarded much (only 4 discards). Since my Green Joker provides the most Mult, Wasteful isn't worth it.\n\nLet's check \"Wily Joker\" ($4) - +100 Chips for Three of a Kind. My Blue Joker is +120 Chips for *all* hands. Wily is worse. Even Steven ($4) - +4 Mult for even ranks. My Green Joker is already +20. Even Steven is weak here. The conclusion is, I should buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack.\n\nI'm thinking now about a JSON response. The action will be to `buy_booster`, with the pack being at position 1. And that's it. It's a quick decision.\n\nOkay, now let's think about the consumables. The Jumbo Arcana Pack says \"Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards to be used immediately\". So I don't need inventory space to buy the pack, only to *hold* what it creates. This is important to think about: if I pick a card that *creates* consumables\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
