{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Round Advancement**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm sitting at Ante 7/8, in the Shop phase, with a $30 bankroll. My Joker lineup is looking solid: a Green Joker for a quick +13 Mult, Spare Trousers adding +18 Mult, the Certificate generating a seal each round, Luchador (Polychrome, X1.5 Mult, sell to disable Boss), Constellation gaining X3.1 Mult, and the Blue Joker with a significant +124 Chips boost. I also have Neptune, a consumable that levels up my Straight Flush and I am hoping to get more. My goal is simple: crush the upcoming Big Blind at 52.5k and the Boss at 70k.\n\nRight now, I'm thinking about maximizing my score. My Constellation joker is my primary scaling engine, and I need to fuel it. I need to get the multiplier up.\n\nThe optimal play is clear: I *have* to use Neptune. Leveling the Straight Flush is a bonus, but the real win is the immediate X-Mult boost for Constellation, taking it from X3.1 to X3.2. I have to find Planet cards for more gains.\n\nI'm dismissing buying the Rough Gem – Diamond cards earning a dollar isn’t going to move the needle compared to what Constellation and Spare Trousers are offering. Rerolling the shop for five bucks might net me some Planet or Tarot cards, but that is a gamble right now, so it is a pass.\n\nSo, the action is `use_consumable` at position `1` (Neptune). No cards are required here, as Neptune only modifies my hand ranking. Time to advance!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
