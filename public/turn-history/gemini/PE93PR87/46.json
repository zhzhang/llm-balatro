{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy: Maximize Constellation's Scaling**\n\nOkay, Ante is 2/8, Round 5, and it's time to hit the shop phase. I have $13 to work with. I need to make some key decisions here. The boss blind is coming up next, so I need a short-term and long-term plan.\n\nFirst, I need to take inventory. I have six Jokers, and with the \"negative\" card Constellation, I have one slot open.\n\nHere's my current Joker lineup: Smiley Face (+5 for face cards), Mystic Summit (+15 Mult at 0 discards), Spare Trousers (+2 Mult for Two Pair/Full House), Luchador (Polychrome X1.5, Boss Blind disable), Constellation (Negative, scales with Planets at X1.2 Mult, does not take a joker slot), and the Certificate (Adds a random card with seal).\n\nMy hand levels are Full House Level 2 (65 chips, 6 mult), which isn't bad but can be better. I have Hieroglyph, which can reduce the next Ante and the number of discards, but I need to focus.\n\nLooking at the shop, there's Egg ($4, gains $3 sell value/round), and Sly Joker ($3, +50 Chips for Pair), and two Celestial Packs ($4 each).\n\nThe priority here is to fuel Constellation. It's a key X-Mult that scales with Planets, so I need to get those cards. I have $13, so I can buy both Celestial Packs. While Egg seems like a decent long-term investment, I need to maximize Constellation's multiplier now. Buying planets is the highest priority.\n\nI'll buy both Celestial Packs first. After buying the first Celestial Pack, I have $9. Buying the second Celestial Pack, I have $5.\n\nI will buy the first Celestial Pack and see what I can get.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
