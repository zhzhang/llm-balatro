{"reasoning":"**My assessment of the situation is clear: I need to win the current Ante 8 boss fight, Verdant Leaf, to reach 100,000 chips. I am currently in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase, and the most logical next step is to initiate the round by playing the `play_round` command.**\n\nI have a robust set of Jokers: Green Joker (+26 Mult), Spare Trousers (+20 Mult), Certificate, Luchador (x1.5 Mult), Constellation (x4 Mult), and Blue Joker (+138 Chips). The key to this is using Luchador correctly. Its ability specifically disables the Verdant Leaf blind when sold, which is my main objective to avoid having cards be debuffed.\n\nI have spent a significant amount of time assessing the prompt, and now it is time to assess my resources and the optimal sequence of actions. I must evaluate the best possible action by analyzing both my available commands and the effects of selling my cards at different points in the game. I see no advantage to selling the Luchador immediately because if the boss debuffs my cards, they'll give 0 chips regardless. So I must enter the round. This will enable me to use the Certificate and receive a hand to use the Magician on. I have concluded that selling the Luchador is better *after* entering the round.\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the command list and confirmed that `play_round` is the correct action to begin the boss fight. Once in the `ROUND` phase, I will decide whether to sell Luchador based on the cards in my hand and their contributions, and then I will decide whether to use Magician.\n\nI have considered selling Luchador before entering the round, as it disables the boss. However, I want to keep the Luchador multiplier (x1.5) as long as possible. Also, I want to use my consumables, like Certificate and The Magician (on the cards drawn), for maximum effectiveness. Starting the round is the ideal next step.\n\nMy logic is as follows: I need to see my hand to optimize my plays. Selling Luchador after the Verdant Leaf debuff makes my cards worth 0 chips and 0 mult. With a simple pair, I should hit 100,000 with a pair, +26, +20, and the Blue Joker.\n\nI can't use Judgement or The Magician until I begin the round. I'll need to sell Luchador inside the round, after the debuff, to leverage the full multiplier effect and hopefully hit the target of 100,000 chips. With my hand, my Joker order is optimal: Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation, Blue Joker.\n\nGiven all of this, the action is `play_round`. The JSON is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
