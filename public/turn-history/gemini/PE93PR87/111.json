{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4/8, Round 11. I'm aiming for Ante 8 (the boss) and then eight wins to clear the run. I have $40. My current goal is to build a winning engine, specifically focused on my existing Jokers and leveling up the hands.\n\nI have some key Jokers: the Green Joker, which is Holo and gains Mult each hand, the Mystic Summit, which gives +15 Mult with 0 discards, Spare Trousers, which gives +8 Mult and scales with Two Pair, the Certificate which adds a random sealed card to my hand each round, the Luchador which I can sell to disable Boss Blinds, and the Constellation which gives x0.1 Mult per Planet card used and is currently at x2.2. I have all six Joker slots full.\n\nGiven my money and the Jokers, I need to buy Planets to scale Constellation! I'm thinking I'll focus on scaling multipliers late-game, and my current hand focus is Two Pair and Pair.\n\nI'm offered Acrobat (x3 Mult on the final hand) and Onyx Agate (+7 Mult for Clubs). Acrobat is too passive, and Onyx Agate is not as useful as a Planet card to scale Constellation.\n\nI'm also offered a Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6 and an Arcana Pack for $4. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is the clear winner for two reasons: It gives a Planet card which triggers Constellation and it could level up my hands.\n\nTherefore, I'll buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack. I'll have $34 remaining (well above the $25 needed for max interest). After opening the pack, I'll select the best planet card for my Two Pair build.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
