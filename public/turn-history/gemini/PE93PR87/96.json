{"reasoning":"**My Current Thinking**\n\nOkay, Ante 4, Round 9. Shop phase. I've got $31.  My Joker setup is: Green Joker (Holo), Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome), and Constellation (Negative).  I'm aiming for Ante 8, primarily scaling mult using Green Joker, Spare Trousers, and Constellation. I have no consumables or good vouchers available.\n\nMy initial thought is that Mail-In Rebate is useless here. My shop options are reroll for $5, or move to the next round. Rerolling is probably worth it, given the $31 bank, which should still give maximum interest ($5). With $31, I can afford to reroll and keep the interest.\n\nI'm searching for Planet cards to boost Constellation. Tarot cards could help find them. Better Jokers might be an option, but my slots are full.  Since the Wheel of Fortune was used last turn, and the current shop is empty of useful items, rerolling seems sensible or proceeding to the round are the choices.\n\nI'm leaning toward Constellation as my primary scaling engine (x2.1 Mult). Planets are the priority. I need Two Pairs for Spare Trousers.  Green Joker needs hands played.\n\nChecking the money again: $31. Reroll costs $5.  $26 remaining. Still $5 interest.\n\nGiven my reliance on Constellation, finding Planets is the key.\n\nLet's check the commands: `round_select` or `reroll_shop`. Rerolling has the potential for a Planet card or a helpful Tarot. `round_select` saves money, or I can see the next blind.\n\nLet's quickly review the Jokers: Constellation is Negative, and I want that to scale. Green Joker is Holo (+10). Mystic Summit is base. Spare Trousers is scaling.\n\nThe build is stable. One reroll is safe.\n\nRerolling to find a Planet is the best move here. With a $26 total after the reroll, I'll still have max interest.\n\nRerolling is the most efficient choice in this situation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
