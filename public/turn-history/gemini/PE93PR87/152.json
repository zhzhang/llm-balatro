{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here we are, round 14, ante 6/8. Time to make a strategic choice from this Planet Pack. My goal, as always, is to maximize the `Constellation` Joker – that x2.5 multiplier is key, and each planet card I use adds +0.1 to it. I've got a strong hand focus going: Three of a Kind (level 8), and then Pair/Two Pair because I have the `Spare Trousers` Joker which is focused on Two Pair.\n\nI've got a bunch of interesting Jokers: a `Green Joker` (+10 Mult), `Spare Trousers` (+12 Mult and Two Pair focus), a `Certificate`, `Luchador` (x1.5 Mult, Polychrome), `Constellation` (x2.5 Mult), and a `Blue Joker` (+120 Chips). I also have two consumables, `The Lovers` and `Strength`, burning a hole in my pocket.\n\nMy current options are: `Jupiter` (Flush, Level 2), `Mercury` (Pair, Level 6), `Pluto` (High Card, Level 2), and `Uranus` (Two Pair, Level 2). Each of them will contribute to my `Constellation` multiplier.\n\n`Mercury` is tempting because it would bump my Pair hand from Level 6 to 7. `Uranus` would boost my Two Pair hand, the one that synergizes with `Spare Trousers`. `Pluto` and `Jupiter` are less critical at this stage.\n\nA quick thought - I used Black Hole on my last draw to upgrade all my hands.\n\nThe decision is tricky. `Mercury` gives me a solid hand upgrade for a core hand. `Uranus` improves the hand I need for the `Spare Trousers` scaling, which can significantly boost my score. However, given my Three of a Kind being the strongest, the difference may not be that significant between the two options when compared to the `Constellation` boost from any planet choice. `Mercury` might be a better fallback hand.\n\nAh, I just remembered, it's a *Planet* Pack. Selecting a Planet card triggers its use, and since I have no space for inventory, I *must* use one of my consumables. I have to choose now!\n\nSo, the optimal play here is to select `Mercury` (index 2) – it's the more reliable hand improvement overall.\n\nTherefore, the action is `select`, and the position is `[2]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
