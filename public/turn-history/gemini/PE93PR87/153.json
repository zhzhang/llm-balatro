{"reasoning":"**Round 14 Strategy: Play to Scale and Find Planets**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my current situation. Ante 6/8, Big Blind up, Boss Blind is The Mark. I've got $28, six Joker slots filled, and a solid hand level progression. The immediate decision is to play or skip. Skipping offers a Holographic tag for the next shop Joker, but I already have a pretty good Joker set-up. My primary consideration is that playing this round has several key advantages.\n\nFirst, I get to scale up Green Joker and Spare Trousers. Green Joker is already at +10 Mult, and Spare Trousers is at +12. Playing lets them grow, and I need the added additive mult since I don't have enough Mult from cards yet. I have Blue Joker which adds Chips, which is good.\n\nSecond, the Constellation Joker (x2.5 and growing) is my primary multiplier. Shops are the best way to get Planet cards to increase its multiplier, so skipping skips an opportunity to scale Constellation further.\n\nI have Luchador as boss insurance (thanks to its Polychrome edition giving me x1.5 Mult) and Certificate to add cards. The plan is to play the round, try to hit the required score (30,000), and use Luchador to disable the Boss only if necessary. Since the Boss is face cards down, I'd rather play through if I can.\n\nThe score from my hands last round with Flush was 23,328 and Two Pair was 17,305. The hands are scaling, but with a 3-of-a-kind at level 8, and my current modifiers (+22 additive, x1.5, x2.5), I should easily hit the target score.\n\nI looked over the description of Luchador, and, ignoring the corrupted text, I understand it has a base effect to disable the boss, and the Polychrome edition grants x1.5 Multiplier.\n\nMy Joker order is correct: Green Joker and Spare Trousers (+additives) are to the left of Luchador and Constellation (multipliers). Blue Joker adding chips is last (chips are calculated before mults).\n\nI considered skipping for the Holographic Tag, but my current Jokers are solid. A Holographic Joker might replace a common joker at best, but the ones I have are all specialized and scaling. Playing to scale Constellation is higher value.\n\nThus, my action is to `play_round`. No positions or intended hand type are needed. I'm going to estimate the chips as null because I can easily hit the score I need.\n\nFinal Decision: **Play the round.**\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
