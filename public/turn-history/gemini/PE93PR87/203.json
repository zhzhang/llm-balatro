{"reasoning":"**Strategic Card Selection: Prioritizing Constellation Scaling**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 18. We're in a STANDARD_PACK (Mega Standard Pack) scenario. I've got $22, and this hand is stacked, but it needs fine-tuning for maximum impact. I have some key Jokers in play: Green Joker (Holo, +13), Spare Trousers (+18), Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome, x1.5, boss disable), Constellation (Negative, x3.5), and Blue Joker (+126 chips). The Judgement consumable is ready to go.\n\nThe Mega Standard Pack is offering me two choices. I need to make these choices count.\n\nLooking at the options, the 5 of Diamonds with the **Blue Seal** (Option 5) *immediately* stands out. Given that I have the Constellation Joker, this is an absolute game-changer. The Blue Seal guarantees a planet card at the end of the hand if held, which is absolutely critical for that Constellation scaling. This card becomes the cornerstone of my strategy.\n\nOption 2, the 8 of Diamonds Mult card, is decent, but it's secondary to the immediate benefit of a guaranteed planet.\n\nOption 3, the 5 of Diamonds Gold Seal, is good for consistent income, but it doesn't have the same immediate synergy.\n\nOptions 1 and 4, basic cards, can be discarded as they offer no synergy.\n\nTherefore, the first selection is an easy call. I have to go with the 5 of Diamonds with the Blue Seal.\n\nThe fact that this is a Mega Pack means that I select one card at a time. After selecting the Blue Seal card, I will evaluate the remaining options. It's a choice between options 1, 2, 3, 4. At that point, the Mult card (Option 2) or the Gold Seal (Option 3) will be the best bets, depending on the remaining cards.\n\nSo, first I need to select card number 5.\nAction: `select`\nPosition: `5`\nI'm going to take the 5 of Diamonds with the Blue Seal.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
