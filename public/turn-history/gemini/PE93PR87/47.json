{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Selection: Earth for Full House Dominance**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2/8, Round 5. I'm in the SHOP phase, specifically looking at a PLANET_PACK from a Celestial Pack. I've got $9 in the bank. My Joker lineup is pretty solid: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers (+2 mult), Luchador (Polychrome, X1.5), Constellation (Negative, X1.2), and a Certificate. Constellation is the key here; it scales by X0.1 every time I use a Planet card, and I'm keen to make the most of that.\n\nI've got three Planet choices in the pack: Venus (Three of a Kind, Level 2 -> 3), Earth (Full House, Level 2 -> 3), and Mars (Four of a Kind, Level 1 -> 2). My hand levels currently are: Full House is Level 2 (65 chips, 6 mult), and Three of a Kind is Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult). Looking back at my recent hands, I've played Full House in 4 out of the last 5 hands, so it's clearly my go-to strategy.\n\nMy instinct is to pick Earth. It levels up Full House, which I'm consistently playing. Venus levels up Three of a Kind, but that's not my primary focus. Mars levels up Four of a Kind, which is a consideration but not my primary hand. Earth is the most logical choice. I know that Earth will contribute to Constellation, increasing its multiplier by X0.1 to X1.3, which is important.\n\nI just need to select `2`, since it's a planet being used immediately. I need to keep in mind, I still have one more Celestial Pack in the shop ($4), so I'm trying to make the most strategic move to carry me through.\n\nSo, the command is simply `select 2`. And my intent here is just to select the planet card. The information I would want to track like `intended_hand_type` and `estimated_chips` are irrelevant in this specific shop phase. I'm choosing Earth. No reason not to, considering the recent hand trends and the impact on Constellation. With Full House being Level 2, I will make the best use of this option. And, *finally*, to recap, the command will be `select 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
