{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Celestial Pack for Maximum Value**\n\nOkay, here we are, Round 14, Ante 6/8, and staring down a Mega Celestial Pack. Money's good at $28, and the Jokers are a solid mix – Green, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation, and Blue. Consumables are The Lovers and Strength, both maxed at 2. The primary goal is to leverage this pack to boost Constellation and my hand levels.\n\nLooking at the options, we have: Jupiter (Flush), Black Hole (upgrade all hands by 1), Mercury (Pair), Pluto (High Card), and Uranus (Two Pair). Immediately, the **Black Hole** stands out. This card is a game-changer; it's a Spectral card that upgrades every hand type by one level. And yes, I double checked, Black Hole *does* count as a planet card for my Constellation joker, which means it will trigger a significant mult boost. Compared to a regular planet, which boosts *one* hand, Black Hole boosts *all* hands. Since I'm running Three of a Kind (Level 7), Pairs (Level 5), and Full Houses (Level 4), Black Hole's universal upgrade is strictly superior to the individual boosts of the other planets.\n\nSo, the plan is clear: **select** Black Hole. This brings the Constellation mult from x2.4 to x2.5. After this, I'll have one more card to pick.\n\nThe schema will be updated with: action is \"select\", positions is [2] (Black Hole), the intended hand type is null (since this is a shop phase), and the estimated chips is null (also since this is a shop phase).\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
