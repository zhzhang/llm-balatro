{"reasoning":"**Current Card Selection: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 7, Round 18, deep in a Mega Standard Pack. I've got $22 in the bank and a solid Joker lineup: Green (+13 Mult, Holo), Spare Trousers (+18 Mult), Certificate (adds a sealed card), Luchador (Polychrome, x1.5 Mult, boss disable), Constellation (negative, x3.5 Mult, scales with planets), and Blue Joker (+128 Chips). I also have a Judgement consumable and Hieroglyph voucher. The goal, as always, is scaling Constellation and generating value, especially since we are at Ante 7, which means final boss fights are coming.\n\nThe immediate situation: I'm making the second pick from the current Mega Standard Pack. The first card was already chosen. My choices are:\n\n*   Choice 2: 8 of Diamonds (Mult Enhancement, +4 Mult)\n*   Choice 3: 5 of Diamonds (Gold Seal, $3 when scored)\n\nAlright, let's break this down. In a previous turn, I chose a Blue Seal. My initial thought was to pick the Mult card. Given the current Jokers, the +4 Mult isn't *huge*, but a +10% increase is never bad. The Gold Seal, on the other hand, gives me a steady stream of income. I need to make sure I finish this pack.\n\nInitially, I leaned towards the Gold Seal for the money, but at this stage of the game, more scoring is safer. However, the more I think about it, the Gold Seal will help me buy rerolls to get more Planets. This will scale Constellation.\n\nOkay, let's examine my initial thoughts. The previous turn's logic was to pick the Multi card. The \"5 of Diamonds Gold Seal\" has some value in consistent income, and it is a good pick. \n\nI *need* to pick one of these cards. I have to think about this in the long run. I know that the Gold Seal is useful in creating consistency in economy. Money means I can reroll more planets (which will increase Constellation's scaling).\n\nI'm thinking I should check if I have room in hand? No, these add to the deck.\n\nI just need to pick the best of the remaining. I'll take the Mult card. *No, no!* Let's re-think this. The Gold Seal will probably be best in the long run.\n\nThe prompt is asking for a single parseable JSON.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nWait, back up. The description for the Gold Seal reads, \"Earn $3 when this card is played and scores\". A quick glance at the choices: is the 5 of Diamonds Gold Seal. It's an interesting card.\n\nThis 8 of Diamonds Multi (in position 2) card looks like a good option for points. However, the economy is *very* interesting. If I can get more Planets, I can scale Constellation. So, for the long run, I need to make sure I pick the right card.\n\n*   Okay, so I will take the Multi card, but I should examine the situation.\n    *   The Multi Card: helps the immediate scoring\n    *   The Gold Seal: helps build economy in the long run.\n\nActually, it doesn't matter much for my current setup. I'll take the Multi card.\n\nWait, looking at the previous turn logic: Now the choices are 1, 2, 3, 4. Original Choice 2 was \"8 of Diamonds Mult\". Original Choice 3 was \"5 of Diamonds Gold Seal\". The positions are the same. I'll still go for the Multi card.\n\nOkay, no, let's examine the situation. Economy is often better for planets. I need to get the Gold Seal card (Choice 3), to scale Constellation.\n\nThe positions and the actions:\n\nAction: `select`\n\nPosition: `[2]` or `[3]`! Let's go with the Gold Seal. So the position is `[3]`.\n\nWait, the prompt requires a JSON string with `select` as the action, and a `positions` entry with an array of indices. That means it would be `[2]`.\n\nLet's pick 2 (Mult).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nDouble check the current state: We have selected\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
