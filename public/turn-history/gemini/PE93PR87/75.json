{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Joker Rearrangement**\n\nOkay, here's the play. I'm deep into this run, Ante 3, Round 7, with $32 and the Shop's open. The setup's looking solid, but I need to maximize my scaling. I've got six Jokers, and this is the order they are in at the moment:\n\n1.  Mystic Summit (+15 Mult at 0 discards) - *potentially good, but will become worse as discards are used*\n2.  Spare Trousers (+2 Mult for Two Pair) - *Okay, scales with the hand*\n3.  Luchador (Polychrome x1.5, Boss disable) - *Solid edition effect*\n4.  Constellation (Negative, X1.9 Mult, +1 Joker slot) - *Potential for big numbers, but negative Joker*\n5.  Certificate (Adds card with seal each round) - *Utility*\n6.  Green Joker (Holo +10 Mult, scales +1/-1) - *Strong, but suffers with discards*\n\nRight now I see three interesting options at the shop:\n\n*   Merry Andy (+3 discards, -1 hand size) - $7 - *Hand size reduction is a big no-no here, and discards are problematic for the Green Joker*\n*   Buffoon Pack - $4 - *Potentially great, but I'm at 6/6 Jokers.  To take one, I'd have to sell another.*\n*   Wasteful (+1 discard each round) - $10 - *Would be problematic for Green Joker.*\n\nI also have the Hieroglyph voucher, which makes my hand size 7 cards (starting at 8). I'm looking at my hand types, I have Full House (Level 4), Three of a Kind (Level 3), Pair (Level 4), Straight (Level 2).\n\n*   I've got a Green Joker (Holo), which gives a solid +10 Mult.\n*   I also have Constellation (x1.9 Mult), a strong scaler.\n*   Luchador gives x1.5 Mult.\n\n**Prioritization is the Key**\n\nI have to get my Joker order right. I need to prioritize where my +Mult cards are and ensure my xMult cards are at the end. Math is the key. Right now, Green Joker is sixth in line. Its Holo effect (+10) and its internal mult should be applied *before* the X Mult jokers (Luchador and Constellation) for maximum value.\n\n**Here's the Math**\n\nI'm sitting on a base hand value, which then gets multiplied by Joker Mults, so to optimize I need to ensure that the order is:\n+Mult (Mystic, Trousers, Green Joker) followed by xMult (Luchador, Constellation)\n\nCurrently: (+15) -> (+2) -> (x1.5) -> (x1.9) -> (nothing) -> (+10)\n\nOptimized: (+10) -> (+15) -> (+2) -> (x1.5) -> (x1.9)\n\nI want to use the `rearrange_jokers` action. And *now* is the time.\n\n**The Plan**\n\nMy goal is to put the Multitive effects last in the list, to maximize their impact.\n\nTherefore, the action I'm taking is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"rearrange_jokers\",\n  \"positions\": [6, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4]\n}\n```\n\nNow, I'll rearrange. Then, I will consider the next action: possibly buy the Buffoon pack. But the *best* next action is the rearrangement.\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [6,1,2,5,3,4]"}
