{"reasoning":"**Current Strategic Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 4, with $52 in the bank. My primary scoring hand has been Three of a Kind, so getting that up in level is crucial. I'm holding a Venus consumable (level 3 Three of a Kind). I also have a Constellation Joker that scales with the number of planets I use. Currently, it's at x1.9 Mult. My core goal here is to maximize my scoring potential and ensure a strong economic position.\n\nI have a few promising options in the shop: a Grabber voucher (+$1 per hand, excellent for both economy and getting a higher score when I choose to end the hand), a Celestial Pack (to potentially get more planet cards and further scale my Constellation Joker), and an Arcana Pack (to modify the deck). I've got a Mail-In Rebate Joker in the shop too, but I'm at the Joker limit (5 non-negative, 1 negative). So, Mail-In Rebate is out. I should use Venus to increase Constellation Mult before purchasing more cards.\n\nMy immediate action is to use the Venus consumable, which is already in my possession. This will level up the Three of a Kind and boost the Constellation Joker to x2.0 Mult. This seems like the most impactful move at this juncture to scale my main scoring hand and optimize the power of my currently owned Jokers.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
