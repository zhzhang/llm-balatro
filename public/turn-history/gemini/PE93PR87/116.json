{"reasoning":"**Ante 4, Round 11: Assessing My Options**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante 4, Round 11. I've got $25 in the bank. My Joker setup is looking solid: Green Joker, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, and Constellation. The Constellation is the key here since Negative lets me max out the Joker slots.\n\nMy hand levels are pretty good: Three of a Kind at Level 6, Pair at Level 5, and Full House at Level 4. I could work with Two Pair, especially with Spare Trousers scaling off it, but the others are stronger.\n\nThe shop offers Showman ($5) and Scholar ($4). Showman isn't a priority unless I'm going for some sort of specific duplicate strategy, which I'm not. Scholar isn't bad with the Aces I have, one with a Purple Seal, the other Glass, but it won't give me as much boost as the Jokers I already have.\n\nFinancially, I'm at the $25 sweet spot for interest. Rerolling the shop for $6 would drop me to $19, losing that sweet extra dollar. I have already used up any consumables.\n\nGiven my current mult sources, I think my setup is pretty strong for this Ante. It's time to progress to the next blind. The shop doesn't have anything that would immediately benefit my Constellation, like a Planet. I'm also already at my Joker limit.\n\nAlright, I've exhausted my shop options. Time to hit `round_select` and move on.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
