{"reasoning":"**My Initial Shop Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I've won the small blind and have $10 to spend in this early shop. No Jokers, no consumables, no vouchers yet. Time to strategize. The immediate goal is to build power for scaling up through the early Antes.\n\nLooking at the options, Mystic Summit is intriguing. +15 Mult is a huge boost, but it's conditional on having no discards. That could be a liability early on, as I like to have a few discards as back up. Then there is Uranus, but that doesn't really seem like a great value here.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack and the Celestial Pack are both available too. The Buffoon Pack for $4, however, seems like the best value for money early on because it is almost always a decent option for getting early Jokers. Celestial Pack is okay, but early Jokers are what I really need. The Magic Trick voucher is far too expensive.\n\nMy first thought was to get the Buffoon Pack. It's a cheap way to get a Joker and then I would be able to make a choice between that and Mystic Summit. I initially decided to buy the Buffoon Pack. But, hold on... if I *do* the math and buy the Buffoon Pack first, I'll have $6 left. That means I can *still* buy Mystic Summit ($5)! That would be a very strong start with an immediate +15 Mult and whatever I get from the pack. That's *very* compelling for the first Ante.\n\nThere's also the Polychrome Tag to skip Big Blind to consider, but having a scoring Joker would make skipping the Big Blind safer and more effective. It would give me the ability to build up my hand before having to play again.\n\nSo, the optimal play here is simple. I need to see what's in the Buffoon Pack first.\n\nMy next action, as an expert, is to `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
