{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante and Making a Calculated Play**\n\nAlright, Ante 4, Round 9. I've got $26, and I'm gunning for Ante 8. My Joker setup is pretty solid right now: Green Joker for that scaling multi and hand play, Mystic Summit for the no-discard boost, Spare Trousers synergizing with Two Pair, Luchador for blind-disabling power, and Constellation powering up with Planets. Certificate is a wild card. My hand levels are decent, but I want to focus on Two Pairs.\n\nThe shop isn't exactly offering anything that fits my current strategy. Runner wants Straights, which isn't the current plan, and Gluttonous Joker is a negligible club-specific boost. With max interest at $5, rerolling for $6 doesn't seem worthwhile at this stage. It would drop my balance to $20, resulting in a loss of $1 interest. I'm mainly looking for planets to synergize with Constellation or a really useful Tarot card.\n\nLet's take a closer look at my current Jokers. Green Joker is at a total of +12 Mult, Mystic Summit adds +15, Spare Trousers gives a +2 Mult to two pair hands. Luchador provides a x1.5 Mult and Constellation is a x2.1 Mult, scaling with Planets. Based on a Pair Lvl 5 (base of 6) it looks like (6 + 12 + 15 + 2) * 1.5 * 2.1 which equals ~110 Mult! So around 11,000 chips per hand. More if I play Two Pair or Certificate adds something.\n\nThe current Ante 4 requirements should be manageable with my current build.\n\nI've already rerolled once. The shop is bad. Rerolling again for $6 is costly. I've got no booster packs or vouchers.\n\nGiven the shop and the amount of money I have, the best move is to proceed to the next blind.\n\n*Action*: `round_select`.\n\n`{\"action\": \"round_select\"}`\n\nWait, before I commit, let me do one last review.\n\nRunner? No. Gluttonous Joker? Nah. Reroll? Nope, I'll stick with max interest. The next shop might offer something better (fresh boosters, a voucher).\n\nMy hand levels are pretty good. Full House and Three of a Kind are both level 4. Pair is level 5. Two Pair is level 1.\n\nI need to focus on playing more Two Pairs to scale up Spare Trousers to increase my Mult and make it worth it!\n\nFinal Decision: Proceed to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
