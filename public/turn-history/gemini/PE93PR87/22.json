{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Decision: Round 3 - Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2/8, Round 3, and I'm in the SHOP phase. I have a measly $1. The Big Blind is coming up, requiring 1200 chips.\n\nMy hand consists of the following Jokers: Smiley Face (additive mult for face cards), Mystic Summit (additive mult at zero discards), Luchador (Polychrome multiplier, and disables boss), Constellation (multiplicative x1.1), and Certificate (adds a card with a seal at the start of the round). I also have all 5 Joker slots filled; Constellation is a negative joker but I have no other options currently.\n\nThe shop offerings are The Hanged Man ($3), Arcana Pack ($4), Mega Arcana Pack ($8), and Wasteful Voucher ($10). Clearly, nothing is affordable. Rerolls are also out of the question because they cost $5. I have no consumables to play or sell.\n\nGiven my financial constraints, the immediate goal is to make sure my Jokers are optimized. Let's make sure the order is correct. I should maximize the additive multipliers first, then the multiplicative multipliers. Smiley Face and Mystic Summit should be on the left of my Joker list, with Luchador and Constellation on the right. Currently, the order is: Smiley, Mystic Summit, Luchador, Constellation, Certificate. That looks correct. The Certificate, with its \"at the start of the round\" effect, is best left at the end. I also rechecked my Luchador/Constellation ordering to make sure I'm maximizing the multipliers. Since I can't buy anything, I'm okay with that for now.\n\nWait a second. I need to make the round selection so that I don't skip the Big Blind (1200 chips).\n\nConsidering selling a Joker? Smiley ($2) + $1 = $3. I could buy Hanged Man. Not worth it. Selling Mystic Summit? Same result. Certificate ($3) + $1 = $4. That might be worth it for the Arcana Pack, but it’s a gamble. Don't sell the multiplier, Luchador. Ultimately, I'll keep the Certificate for its potential long-term deck manipulation benefits and potential blue seals.\n\nFinal analysis: No shop interactions are possible. Therefore, the only available action is to proceed to the next phase, which will be the Blind Select screen. This is the correct step, so the action is `round_select`.\n\nHere's my JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nReady to go.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
