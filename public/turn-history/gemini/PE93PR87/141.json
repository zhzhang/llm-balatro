{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5 of 8, Round 13, and currently in the SHOP phase. I have $34 to work with. The Boss Blind is The Pillar, which means any card played this round will be debuffed. That's something to keep in mind.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid: I have Green Joker (Holo), Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation (Negative), and Blue Joker. I'm maxed out at 6 Jokers. The shop has Death, The Tower, and a Standard Pack. My priority remains scaling Constellation via Planets and utilizing Spare Trousers for Two Pair. I also need to figure out how to deal with the Boss Blind, for which Luchador is my key. I also have Strength and Lovers.\n\nI've already rerolled the shop once. The current shop has no Planets or Celestial Packs. I need Planets to get the most out of Constellation. Death and The Tower are tempting, but I can't use them directly in the shop because they require card targeting. I am at max consumables.\n\nRerolling is $8, and I'm at $34. It's the best way to find Planets/Celestial Packs. I have to think about the interest cap of $25. Another reroll puts me at $26, which is acceptable. The Standard Pack isn't immediately helpful. I could sell a consumable to buy Death, but I can't use it in the shop.\n\nLooking back at previous turns, I see I bought and used Emperor last turn, and then rerolled twice. This is turn 142. The shop currently shows Death, The Tower, and Standard Pack. If I keep rerolling, I'll run out of money.\n\nI have to choose between buying nothing, or rerolling. I do have Luchador for the Boss, but Constellation is the priority. Rerolling could get me a Planet card.\n\n**Decision Time:**\n\nI've decided to reroll one more time to look for a Celestial Pack or a Planet card. If the shop is still unhelpful, I'll advance to the next round. Reroll, reroll, reroll.\n\nI'm rerolling the shop. Reroll, the magic word of the day!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
