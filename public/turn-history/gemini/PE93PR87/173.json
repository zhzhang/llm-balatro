{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Leveraging Constellation for Maximum Multiplier**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop, Round 16 of Ante 7/8. Got $58 in the bank. Let's see... my Joker lineup is pretty solid. I've got a Green Joker boosting multiplier, Spare Trousers with a decent multiplier, Certificate to add cards (always useful), Luchador with polychrome, Constellation which is where my focus is (x2.8 multiplier), and a Blue Joker providing a huge chunk of chips. I also have \"The Lovers\" and \"Pluto\" consumables on hand. My goal is to make Constellation as potent as possible.\n\nRight, so I just used \"The High Priestess\" card in the previous round, and that created \"Pluto\". I already had \"The Lovers\" in one slot and, because I had one slot open, Pluto landed in the second consumable slot. Now I want to enhance Constellation. The Constellation Joker gets a bonus multiplier for every Planet card played.\n\nMy action now is clear: use Pluto. That will level up the High Card hand and give Constellation an additional multiplier, moving it from x2.8 to x2.9. It's a small boost, but these small gains add up. I know I used the `buy_and_use_consumable` command earlier for \"The High Priestess\" – resulting in \"The Lovers\" in slot 1 and \"Pluto\" in slot 2.\n\nUsing Pluto, I'll free up a consumable slot, giving me options for my next purchase. Looking at the shop, I'm thinking... The Standard Pack is tempting for deck manipulation, but the Certificate already does a good job there. An Arcana Pack is always good for Tarots. \"Scary Face\" is probably overkill with the Blue Joker providing so many chips. The Director's Cut is my insurance for the boss round.\n\nTherefore, Priority 1: Use Pluto to buff Constellation.\n\nSo, I need to execute `use_consumable 2` because Pluto is currently in slot 2. Pluto doesn't require playing cards as targets, it levels up a hand type. This will cost me nothing since I already have the consumable, and the impact will be a permanent multiplier increase to Constellation. That's a good investment.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
