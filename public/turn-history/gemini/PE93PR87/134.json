{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment and Action Plan**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm at Ante 5/8, Round 13, and sitting on a healthy $62. My primary focus is getting Constellation to *really* work, so I'm hyper-focused on finding Planet cards to scale it. I've got a decent Joker setup with scaling on hands played (Green Joker), Two Pair (Spare Trousers), chips (Blue Joker), and base mult (Luchador). I've got a Certificate too, which is just free cards. I have a Luchador to get started on the mult bonus, and Hieroglyph to help with scaling.\n\nRight now, the Shop's giving me some interesting options. Wheel of Fortune is a cheap gamble at $3, potentially boosting a card's edition, but I *really* want planets. Justice for $3 is also there, but is risky (it's a glass card). A Standard Pack for $4 isn't a high priority unless I'm hunting for something specific, and definitely not right now. But the Arcana Pack for $4 is the key; it has a good chance to directly give me Planets, or Emperor/Priestess (via Priestess/Emperor) which gives me a path towards planets.\n\nInitially, I thought about buying the Wheel of Fortune because it's cheap, but *buy_booster 2* is the Arcana Pack. That's the priority now. My primary goal is to buy and use the Arcana Pack immediately, to try to increase my chances of planets. Then I can think about Justice. The Wheel of Fortune seems like a good buy. But Arcana first is the priority.\n\nOkay, let's look at the instructions, `buy_and_use_consumable` seems to be the right command for Wheel of Fortune. Wheel is the cheaper option. But let's check.\n\nWait, looking at my current context, the `buy_booster` is specifically the Arcana Pack. So, that is what I should choose. This is more in line with my overall strategy of finding Planet cards.\n\nSo, let's skip the Wheel of Fortune for now, and *buy_booster 2*. Let's go ahead and select it.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
