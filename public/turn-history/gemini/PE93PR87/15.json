{"reasoning":"**My Analysis: Selecting the Optimal Joker**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 2, $5 in the bank, and staring down a Buffoon Pack in the shop. I need to make a strategic Joker selection. I'm currently holding Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, and Luchador. These Jokers are all fine, but let's see what's in the pack: 8 Ball (Foil) and Constellation (Negative).\n\n*   **8 Ball (Foil):** +50 Chips and a chance for Tarot cards. Nice early boost in chips, but my current Jokers are focused on Multiplier.\n*   **Constellation (Negative):** This is where it gets interesting. \"Negative\" means I *gain* a Joker slot! Essentially, it gives me a free Joker slot (upgrading from 5 to 6), and more importantly, it offers a x0.1 Mult for every Planet card played. That is a *scalable multiplier*. I can get a Celestial pack right away for $4, triggering this.\n\nClearly, Constellation is the superior choice for long-term scaling and its \"free\" slot. 8 Ball offers a temporary chip boost, but doesn't have the same potential.\n\nSo, the optimal move is to select Constellation. The command is `select 2`.\n\nNow, according to the schema I must return a JSON object, not an array.\n\nI'm making sure I don't forget I need to buy a Celestial Pack next.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [2],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
