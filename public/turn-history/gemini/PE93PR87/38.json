{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Small Blind Skip**\n\nOkay, Ante 2, Round 4. This is the BLIND_SELECT phase. I've got a Small Blind coming up, 800 chips needed, and I'm sitting on a meager $6. I have a solid joker setup: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers (unscaled), Luchador, Constellation, and a Certificate. The Hieroglyph voucher is active, which is nice. I also have the Investment Tag to skip the Small Blind. The upcoming Big Blind has a D6 Tag for free rerolls, which is useful, but the key here is the immediate decision.\n\nThe Investment Tag offers $25 after the Boss Blind. That's a huge boost early on. Skipping the Small Blind is appealing because I'm basically trading a low-value play for a massive economic gain later. The $3 reward + interest I'd get for playing the Small Blind is puny in comparison. Plus, I’d get to hit the shop, but at this stage, I have very little to spend in the shop.\n\nThe main downside to skipping is missing the opportunity to scale Spare Trousers. I really need to get that joker going. But is the potential +4 or +6 mult worth more than the guaranteed $25? No, the $25 is far more valuable long-term. Plus, the Certificate Joker will add a random card to the deck, and I could get something helpful for scaling Spare Trousers on the next play. \n\nWait, the description of the Boss Blind mentions \"in 7 cards get drawn face down.\" That is irrelevant. I have Luchador to disable any boss annoyances. The Investment Tag is still very high value. I know that skipping the Small Blind for $25 is a standard high-level play. The description says I will get $25 after defeating the next Boss Blind. I skip this small blind, and I get that tag. Then I'll play the big blind, then defeat the boss and get $25. This seems much better than a risky play with very little money.\n\nLet me think about Spare Trousers one more time. Is +4 mult really worth more than $25? Nope. Is there *any* reason not to skip? 800 chips is easily achievable with my current jokers. Full House with face cards will be more than enough to achieve the chip count, and I have Luchador if there is any issues.\n\nThe play is to skip the Small Blind. I will take the $25 and scale the Trousers later. Therefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"skip_round\"}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
