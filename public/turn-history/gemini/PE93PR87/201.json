{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante 7 Shop**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase of Ante 7, Round 18, with $30 in the bank. Let's break this down. My main scaling engine is Constellation, so I need to maximize its multiplier. I just snagged Pluto, thanks to a previous The Fool play. That's key right now.\n\nLooking at my options:\n\n*   I've got a Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation, and a Blue Joker. The max is 6 Jokers.\n*   My consumables are Judgement (unusable) and Pluto.\n*   Card Levels: Pair at 9, Three of a Kind at 10, Full House at 6, and High Card at 4.\n\nThe shop has a Smiley Face for $4 and a Mega Standard Pack for $8. Reroll costs $5.\n\nThe main objective is to set myself up for the end of Ante 7 and, more importantly, Ante 8. Constellation is the cornerstone here.\n\nUsing Pluto *immediately* is the best move. It'll:\n\n1.  Boost my High Card level, although that's not the primary concern.\n2.  Increase Constellation's multiplier from x3.4 to x3.5. That's significant long-term scaling.\n3.  Free up a consumable slot. This is vital for flexibility later, especially if I can sell a Joker and then use Judgement.\n\nSo, the optimal sequence is clear. The plan is:\n`use_consumable 2` (Pluto). Then I'll `buy_booster 1` (Mega Standard Pack), see what's in it, and maybe reroll if the shop is dismal or, perhaps, if I got a great card. After that, I'll move on to the next blind with `round_select`.\n\nPluto doesn't need a target, it's in the correct position, and it will definitely benefit Constellation. It all fits.\nAction: \"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]\nIntended Hand Type: null\nEstimated Chips: null\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
