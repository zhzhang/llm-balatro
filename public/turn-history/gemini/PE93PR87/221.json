{"reasoning":"**Planet Pack Selection: Uranus is the Obvious Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm staring down the barrel of Ante 8, Round 20, and I'm down to $12. The goal is clear: beat the game. I'm in a `PLANET_PACK` selection screen. Let's see what we've got to work with.\n\nThe Jokers I have are: Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation, and a Blue Joker. They are all in play. I'm already maxed out at six. Constellation is currently at x3.7, and this is important.\n\nI have three planet cards: Uranus, Jupiter, and Pluto. Uranus levels up Two Pair (from 3 to 4). Jupiter levels up Flush (from 3 to 4). Pluto levels up High Card (from 5 to 6).\n\nNow, the math is pretty clear. I've got Spare Trousers, which scales with Two Pair. Uranus is my ticket to leveling up that hand. Each planet card played bumps up Constellation's multiplier by 0.1, making it a very valuable Joker. I need to play the long game here, so I want to build a hand to support Spare Trousers.\n\nUranus is the clear choice. It directly improves the Two Pair hand, which, in turn, boosts Spare Trousers. It will also help Constellation. Jupiter is tempting, but Flush is harder to hit consistently. Pluto, while at level 5, is less valuable with the low base stats. The action, as it were, is selecting Uranus, which will increase the hand type associated with Spare Trousers and trigger Constellation. So, `select 1` it is.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
