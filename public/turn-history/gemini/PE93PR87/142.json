{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 5/8, Round 13. I've got $26 in the bank and a pretty solid Joker lineup: a Green Joker with +9 Mult and a Holo upgrade (+10), Spare Trousers (+12 Mult), Certificate, Luchador (Polychrome x1.5), Constellation (x2.3 Mult), and a Blue Joker that gives +118 chips. I also have The Lovers and Strength consumables (both maxed out at 2/2). My goal, as always, is to maximize that score.\n\nRight now, I'm laser-focused on scaling Constellation – it's x0.1 per Planet used. The shop has Venus (Planet), The Emperor (Tarot), and a Standard Pack.\n\nHere's the breakdown: Venus costs $3, and using it levels up Three of a Kind by +20 chips, +2 Mult, and importantly, increases Constellation by x0.1. The Emperor also costs $3 and gives me up to 2 random Tarot cards.\n\nThe obvious play here is to get Venus and get that Constellation multiplier up to x2.4. Problem is, I have 2/2 consumables. I cannot simply buy and hold Venus. However, I *can* `buy_and_use_consumable` directly if the card does not require a target. Planets, like Venus, don't.\n\nSince I have $26, buying Venus will leave me with $23. That's below the interest cap of $25. But, I've spent a lot of time and rerolls already for this exact shop offering. Sacrificing $1 in interest for the Constellation scaling is a good trade.\n\nThe Emperor is tempting, but doesn't scale Constellation. Tarots are useful, but Planets are critical. Venus comes first.\n\nNow, wait... this whole Pillar boss debuff that debuffs cards *already played* this Ante is potentially problematic if I play Luchador. It can be sold to disable this. But scaling Constellation is still the best long-term move.\n\nAlright, the action is `buy_and_use_consumable` and the position is [1], as Venus is Shop Card index 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
