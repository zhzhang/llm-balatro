{"reasoning":"**My Game Plan: A Deep Dive into the Shop**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 7, Ante 3, $34 in the bank. The goal is simple: maximize my score and prepare for the upcoming blinds. My current setup is decent, but I want to make it even better. Constellation is my star, currently at x1.9 Multi, and I'm itching to scale it further by finding Planet cards. I've got a solid Joker core: Mystic Summit benefits from 0 discards, Spare Trousers loves Two Pair hands, Luchador is a consistent x1.5 Multi and Boss killer, and Certificate is generating cards. Smiley Face is just there, but it is the first to go.\n\nThe Shop is open. Let's see what's in store. The obvious play would be to keep finding more planets, but there are none.\n\n*   **Merry Andy:** A tempting +3 discards, but at the cost of -1 hand size. With the Hieroglyph, hand size is already a bit cramped, but +3 discards is huge for digging for combos, especially with Mystic Summit.\n*   **Buffoon Packs (x2):** The real play. I've got 6 Jokers and there is likely an upgrade that'll replace Smiley Face. If I get something really good, I can swap it out. Otherwise, it is just $4.\n*   **Wasteful Voucher:** +1 discard for $10. It's safe, but the -1 hand size from Merry Andy makes it safe to avoid.\n\nMy money is tight, so I want to balance cost and reward. I need a bit more cash too to keep my economy going.\n\nSo, here's my plan. I'll start with the cheapest option: a Buffoon Pack. The goal is to scale my hand. \n\nI'm ready to buy a Buffoon Pack. I'll use the command `buy_booster` 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
