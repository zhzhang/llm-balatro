{"reasoning":"**Joker Inventory Management in Round 7**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 7 with an Ante of 3/8. Currently, I have $30, and the game state is BUFFOON\\_PACK. My immediate concern is that I'm at my Joker limit. I own six: Smiley Face, Mystic Summit, Spare Trousers, Luchador (Polychrome), Constellation (Negative), and Certificate. The game is correctly reporting \"Max Jokers: 6\", and I've confirmed that I currently possess six. Constellation is the \"Negative\" card with a \"+1 Joker slot\" secondary description, but that doesn't seem to be helping me.\n\nThe system indicated that a previous attempt to select a card failed due to the Joker limit. It’s clear that I need to free up a slot before I can acquire a new Joker. My options are a Green Joker (Holographic) which grants +10 Mult (Holo) and +1 Mult per hand/-1 per discard, or Sixth Sense which gives Spectral cards at the cost of 6 cards. I'm leaning toward the Green Joker because +10 mult is an excellent immediate boost, plus the scaling is very nice.\n\nThe question is, which Joker to sell? Smiley Face gives +5 Mult for face cards, Mystic Summit provides +15 Mult at 0 discards, Spare Trousers gives a current +2 Mult and scales with Two Pair, Luchador is Polychrome (x1.5) and disables Boss cards, Constellation is Negative, and Certificate generates cards with seals. The weakest link appears to be Smiley Face, especially compared to the Green Joker. It looks like the Green Joker will have a better long-term strategy for my deck.\n\nThe current command I've been given is `sell_joker`. My action is `sell_joker`, with the *position* `1` which is Smiley Face.\n\nSo, the definitive action is to sell the Smiley Face:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"sell_joker\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
