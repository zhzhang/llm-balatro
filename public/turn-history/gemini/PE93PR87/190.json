{"reasoning":"**My Immediate Action: Consuming Venus**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7, Round 17. Big Blind is 52.5k, Boss is 70k, so I need to maximize my score this round. I've got $30 and a pretty solid setup. I have the Green Joker, Spare Trousers, Certificate, Luchador, Constellation, and Blue Joker. Constellation is the key here; it's currently at x3.0 Mult and scales with planet cards. I have Venus (Three of a Kind) and Neptune (Straight Flush) in my consumables. The Constellation Joker gains x0.1 Mult every time a planet card is used, which makes the consumables extremely desirable to use.\n\nMy overall strategy is to play these planet cards to buff Constellation as fast as possible. I already know that Venus and Neptune don't require card positions for this round, they only level the hands.\n\nTherefore, the ideal order is: First, I'm going to use Venus (Three of a Kind) in consumable position 1. This will level up the Three of a Kind hand and increase Constellation's multiplier.\n\nThe next action is to use Neptune.\n\nThe next action is to decide whether to reroll the shop, or proceed to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
