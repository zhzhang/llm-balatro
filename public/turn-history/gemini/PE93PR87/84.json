{"reasoning":"**Strategic Evaluation for Balatro Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 3, Round 8, at the SHOP step. Got $37 to work with and a pretty decent Joker setup: Green Joker for raw mult, Mystic Summit for scaling, Spare Trousers for Two Pair scaling (not ideal, but a sealer), Certificate (always handy), Luchador (boss disable), and the all-important Constellation, which is key for stacking mult with Planets. I've got a Hieroglyph voucher for Ante reduction and hand size reduction, which is decent. The hand isn't bad: Glass Jack, some basic cards, and a potential Two Pair set-up.  Oh, and I also have two consumables, The Devil and The Chariot.\n\nMy first thought was to use The Chariot on a hand card, but that failed. The log says \"Cannot use consumable at position 2\". Why?  I know the game fairly well. I'm pretty sure you can't *directly* use Tarots on hand cards while browsing the shop. It's only during a round or when a pack is open.  The error is because the shop state isn't the right phase for that.\n\nMy primary goal right now is to find a Planet to start scaling my Constellation Joker, and to find a chance to use the Tarots I have to add value to the hand.\n\nThe shop itself has a Square Joker and Zany Joker (which I don't need since my slots are full), a Standard Pack (not bad, but not a priority), a Wasteful Voucher (bad for Mystic Summit), and a Reroll for $5. I can't do anything with hand cards, so I've quickly realised I should move to a round where I *can* use these Tarots.\n\nThe current strategy is to find those planets. I have $37 and I have two tarot cards. Rerolling the shop is worth considering with $37.\n\nI've got $37 and $5 per reroll. It is worth it in terms of Constellation scaling. But if I don't see a planet, then the Tarots take up space. So the best play to is to try a reroll now to see if a planet appears.\n\nI can't just `use_consumable` like I first thought, so I need to go to `round_select` to start the next round and play cards.\n\nLet's check the shop one last time, though. Standard Pack is $4, which I can afford. It could contain something useful but I really want to save money for rerolls, or for interest. I'll pass on that. My plan is `reroll_shop`.\n\nI have $37 and my max interest is at $25. This $12 is free money, and I can use it to reroll the shop ($5). If I find a planet I will have to sell a tarot for $1 to buy the $3 Planet. This equates to $5 + $3 - $1 = $7 total. Not ideal. However, it's a permanent x0.1 mult boost.\n\nI've been thinking about getting a card to use in the deck for `Certificate` later, but since the `Certificate` Joker gives cards, that's not needed, and I don't want to use that card as a focus. I want to reroll. It's the best option here.\n\nI want to `round_select`, but I might as well `reroll_shop`.\n\nSince I can't use the Tarots during the shop phase, the *correct* action is to go to `round_select` to continue gameplay. But, that's a mistake. I want to reroll for planets.\n\nI will attempt a `reroll_shop`.\n\nOkay, I've thought about it, and the best move is to *try* the `reroll_shop`. I can sell a Tarot if necessary and this maximizes Constellation. I need to take the next round, regardless.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
