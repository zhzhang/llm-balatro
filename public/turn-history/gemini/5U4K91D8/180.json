{"reasoning":"**Deep in the Numbers: A Crucial Discard Decision**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 8, small blind, the goal is 50,000 chips, and I'm currently sitting at 21,157. Three hands remain, three discards available. The pressure's on – I need to find a way to get the necessary chips.\n\nMy current hand: Queen of Spades, 6 of Spades, 10 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts (Bonus), Queen of Clubs (Gold), 4 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds, and *two* 9 of Diamonds (bonus). Three of a Kind is Level 4 with 90 chips and 9 mult, which is the key here.\n\nJokers in play: Juggler (hand size +1), Wily Joker (+100 Chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (Holo Queen bonus of +13 mult per Queen held and +10 Holo mult), Half Joker (+20 mult if hand is 3 cards or fewer), Card Sharp (x3 mult if hand type was already played - which it was!), and Chicot (Polychrome, disabled boss blind and x1.5 mult). Card Sharp is *critical* here.\n\nThe last hand was a Three of a Kind, so Card Sharp is ready to activate for this round. I need to find another 3OAK ASAP. I have two Queens, two 10s, and two 9s. I see a path.\n\nI can discard the 6 of Spades, 3 of Hearts, and 4 of Clubs. But wait, no, I need the Queens in hand for the Shoot the Moon bonus. A Queen 3OAK would lose that bonus. Therefore, I need to focus on finding a third 9 or 10.\n\nBased on card probability and count, there are nine 9s left but only two 10s. I should focus on fishing for the 9s.\n\nLet's do a quick score check if I play a Three of a Kind: 90 chips + 100 chips (Wily) + 27 chips (three 9s) = 217. The Shoot the Moon is +36 mult with two Queens. Half Joker is +20, and the base mult is 9. Additives: 9 + 36 + 20 = 65. The Chicot x1.5 and Card Sharp x3 are multipliers, so 65 * 4.5 = 292.5 mult. A total score of 217 * 292.5 = 63,472.5! I easily clear the hurdle!\n\nSo, the optimal play? Discard the 6, 3, 4, the two 10s and go for a third 9. The current order of the Jokers seems correct. I have to look at the card bonuses: Oh, I have a Bonus card 9 of Diamonds. Excellent. The Queen of Clubs is also a Gold card!\n\nFinal action: Discard 6, 10, 3, 4, 10!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,7]"}
