{"reasoning":"**Initial Assessment and Action: Use Judgement**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 1, Round 0, and I have a decision to make. I'm starting with $4, a Juggler Joker (+1 hand size), Judgement (a consumable that creates a random Joker), and The Sun (converts cards to Hearts), plus a Holographic Tag (skip the round and next shop joker is free and Holographic). My target is 450 chips, and the next blind is The Goad, requiring 600 chips (Spades debuffed).\n\nThe core dilemma is whether to play the round or skip it using the Holographic Tag. Skipping guarantees a Holographic Joker (+10 Mult) in the *next* shop, which is a massive early-game advantage, an advantage I want. Playing the round nets me the $4 reward plus interest (maybe $1) and immediate shop access, but risks missing out on that guaranteed +10 Mult Joker.\n\nI have Judgement, and I can use it *right now* in the Blind Select phase. If the Joker Judgement creates is decent, I'm almost certainly skipping the round for the Holographic Tag. If the Joker is bad, I might still skip. The Holographic Tag is *that* strong.\n\nThe Sun is there, but its utility is dependent on being in a round to convert to Hearts.\n\nSince I am at the Blind Select phase, it appears that the only consumable I can use is Judgement, which will give me a new Joker. I can use the new Joker to make a better decision. Therefore, I will use Judgement first.\n\nTherefore, the action is to use `use_consumable` with position `[1]` (Judgement). The goal is to obtain additional information to make a decision. The schema is: `{ \"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1] }`.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
