{"reasoning":"**Ready for the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here we are: Ante 8, Round 19, facing the big boss blind – the \"Violet Vessel\" equivalent. It needs 300,000 chips, and I have a measly $5 to my name. Fortunately, I'm rolling with my Three of a Kind (3OAK) strategy, powered by a Level 6 Venus. My Joker lineup is looking pretty solid: Juggler for the extra hand size, Wily Joker for the chip boost on 3OAK, Shoot the Moon to get the Queen Mult, Half Joker for playing 3 cards or fewer, Card Sharp for the X3 multiplier on subsequent hands, and Chicot to disable the boss blind effect and add polychrome. Inventory is maxed out, but I'm holding a few useful vouchers: Telescope, Paint Brush, Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Blank, Antimatter.\n\nThe Chicot disables the boss blind effect, so that's irrelevant now. The plan is to play 3OAK to maximize the Card Sharp multiplier (X3) by playing it twice. Half Joker will add +20 mult if I play 3 or fewer cards. Shoot the Moon boosts my mult for each Queen in hand. I'm focusing on those Queens for maximum mult.\n\nSo, the game step is BLIND\\_SELECT, and I need to start the boss round. To do that, I'll use `play_round`. No consumables to use or sell. Joker order looks pretty optimal: Juggler first for more flexibility, then Wily, followed by Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and finally, Chicot. Both Card Sharp and Chicot's multipliers are at the end, so I don't need to shuffle between those two.\n\nI remember from the previous turn I called round_select during the shop phase. To actually start the boss round, it's just `play_round`.\n\nLet's calculate the expected outcome. The base 3OAK at level 6 gives me 130 chips and 13 mult. A first played 3OAK will have: 130 (base) + ~30 (ranks) + 100 (Wily Joker) = 260 chips. Mult: 13 (base) + 10 (Holo Shoot the Moon) + 20 (Half Joker) + (13 * number of Queens in hand). If I have two Queens in hand: 13 + 10 + 20 + 26 = 69 Mult. So, the total for the first hand will be: 260 * 69 = 17,940. With Card Sharp's X3 mult and Chicot X1.5 on the second hand, that becomes 260 * 69 * 3 * 1.5 = 80,730. I need 300,000 chips. It's doable in four or five hands if I get a decent Queen density. The last time, I pulled in 96,120 for the prior hands, so I know I can do it.\n\nThe estimated chips from the last played hand confirms this. Now, all that's left is to enter the round. So, the action is `play_round`, and I don't need any positions, an intended hand type, or estimated chips, so the schema says null.\n\nI'm ready. Let's start the boss round.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
