{"reasoning":"**Analysis: The Optimal Play for a Guaranteed Win**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Current Ante is 7/8, target chips are 70,000, and I'm sitting on 61,350. That means I need 8,650 chips to advance. With only two hands left and one discard available, this is crunch time. I've got a decent hand, but I need to play it smart.\n\nHere's the situation: I've got a Juggler joker that increases the hand size, Wily Joker that nets 100 chips for a 3OAK, Shoot the Moon with Holo + Queens, Half Joker that adds 20 Mult if hand size is <= 3, Card Sharp that x3 mult if the hand played before this round, and Chicot. Plus, The Lovers consumable that I can use to make a card wild. I have a Queen of Spades (Wild), a Queen of Clubs (Gold), a pair of 10s, and a few other cards that aren't immediately relevant. Also, the hand levels are in my favor: Three of a Kind is at Level 3, Pair at Level 2, and High Card at Level 1.\n\nThe critical piece here is the **Card Sharp joker**: it's going to multiply the next hand if I can get a Three of a Kind. The \"Wily\" joker boosts the chips to play three of a kind.\n\nMy instinct is to go for a 3OAK, but I need to make sure. I've got the Lovers to create a Wild for the 3OAK if I can't draw the correct cards. However, the Queen of Spades is already Wild, and the Queen of Clubs would be the second Queen in a potential three-of-a-kind.\n\nThe Queen of Spades is *already* Wild.\n\nI need a three-of-a-kind to trigger Card Sharp (x3) and Wily Joker (+100). If I can get it, the base plus Wily chips will be multiplied by a substantial amount (50 * 3 * 1.5). I can draw five cards to improve my hand. A 3OAK is the key to victory here.\n\nI've decided to play all of the lower-value cards. I will discard the 3, 4, 7, 9, and the Ace.\n\nI discard: 3 (AH), 5 (9H), 6 (7H), 8 (4C), 9 (3D).\n\nI keep: QS, 10S, 10H, QC.\n\nI will draw 5 cards from the deck. A Ten, or a Queen, is a guaranteed win.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,5,6,8,9]"}
