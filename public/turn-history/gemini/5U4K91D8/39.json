{"reasoning":"**My Internal Shop Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 3, Round 5, with $11. My immediate goal is to maximize my score and prepare for the boss, \"The Mark,\" which flips all face cards face down. That's a problem for my \"Shoot the Moon\" strategy, which relies on Queens, but not a deal breaker, as Queens held in my hand will still trigger the +13 mult. Let's see what's in the shop:\n\n*   **Director's Cut ($10):** The voucher allows a boss reroll.\n*   **Bull ($6):** +22 chips.\n*   **Even Steven ($4):** +4 Mult on evens.\n*   **Mega Standard Pack ($8):** Potential card upgrade (Aces/Queens).\n\nMy instinct is to protect the \"Shoot the Moon\" strategy and grab the Director's Cut ($10). That leaves me with $1. Then I see the description: it *unlocks* the reroll, but I still need $10 to *do* the reroll. I only have $1. So, that's useless for this ante.\n\nBut wait. \"The Mark\" just hides the face cards. It doesn't actually *debuff* them. I can still *hold* the Queens and get the Mult. So, buying the Director's Cut is a total waste of money. I can simply play my Aces and hold the face down cards.\n\nAlright, what about the other options? Bull might give me the edge for chips since I have Wily Joker (+100 on 3-of-a-kind). But, I have to sell a joker for it. Juggler is utility, but Showman is riskier. Or, the Mega Standard Pack ($8) could be an upgrade for the future, but it's more of a gamble.\n\nLet me think back to the last hand, I did well with a pair of Aces. The Big Blind is likely to be a lot higher.\n\nThe AI before decided that Director's Cut was a priority. It's on my mind, but that's a waste of money if I can't afford a reroll. If I buy it right now, that's only giving me the boss blind to earn money. Let's see. $4 plus ~$3 interest and hands, still not enough to re-roll. Director's Cut is a no-go.\n\nOkay, let's see. Bull is a decent boost (+22 chips), and I'm full on jokers. The Mega Standard Pack? It's a good way to upgrade my deck. I have Celestial Pack.\n\nI'm thinking more and more that the most logical step is to proceed to the round and build my money. I'm full on Jokers, and I'd need to consider the next ante.\n\nLet's check the shop one more time. I will stick with what I have.\n\nWhat are my other options? I can:\n1.  Go to the round select screen.\n2.  Buy the Standard Pack.\n\nIf I don't buy anything, I can build my bank and potentially use Director's Cut. I already bought the Celestial Pack, so the best move is to build economy and go to round select.\n\nI'll check the shop one last time to make absolutely sure. The Mega Standard Pack ($8) is available. I need to make the decision now.\n\nInterest: $11 gives $2 interest.\n\nIs it worth the money? No.\n\nLet's look at the scenarios:\n\nIf I buy nothing, I can prepare for the next round. But should I get the voucher right now, or will it reappear? It looks like a voucher can only be used once per ante.\n\n*   $11\n*   Director's Cut\n*   Ante 3 Big Blind is 4000 chips.\n*   If I win the Big Blind, plus interest, I'll have the money to actually re-roll.\n\nSo, I will not buy anything. I am keeping my $11 and building the economy. The previous agent wanted to buy the voucher, but it's a huge waste of money. I'm going to follow the logic that I'm building my economy.\n\nI've got Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Scholar, Showman. I need to rearrange jokers? The order doesn't matter, since they all trigger additional mults. All that matters is the mult triggers after the cards score.\n\nSo, *actually* nothing about Jokers needs to change.\n\nLet's go to the shop and buy nothing.\n\n$11 is better than $1 or $3\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
