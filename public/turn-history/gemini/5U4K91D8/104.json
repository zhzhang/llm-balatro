{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Choosing \"The Soul\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm in a `TAROT_PACK` phase. I have $18, which is decent, and a hand with some potential but nothing game-breaking. I'm focusing on the booster pack choices, specifically the \"Jumbo Arcana.\" The Hermit offers a money boost, which is tempting, but then I see *it*: \"The Soul,\" a Legendary Joker. This changes everything.\n\nLegendary Jokers are game-changers. I immediately check if I have room, and thankfully, I do! I have 5 Jokers and a max of 6 (5 base + 1 from the Antimatter voucher). I've got one free slot. \"The Soul\" *must* be selected.\n\nBefore I commit, I quickly re-read all instructions to confirm. My gut says \"pick The Soul.\" I've confirmed I am correctly reading the prompts: `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> ...`. I confirm that The Soul does not need any card selections.\n\nI then double-check the schema and the JSON format. The JSON should be clean and precise:\n\n`{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`\n\nI confirmed that `The Soul` is indeed in the third position of the pack. I'm satisfied. I'm checking my joker slot again. I have 5 owned Jokers, and 6 available max, so I have 1 available slot.\n\nFinally, I take one last look at the other options just in case I am missing something. The Hermit only gives me $18 and Temperance has a sell value of $13. I've re-read the context, and it's clear: I need to generate valid JSON and the instruction is `select`.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
