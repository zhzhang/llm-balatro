{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Ante 3 Shop Phase**\n\nAlright, I'm in the Tarot Pack shop after Ante 3, flush with $4. My Joker situation is maxed out at 5/5: Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Scholar, and Card Sharp. Looking at the options: *Judgement* is tempting, but I'd need to sell a Joker first, and with the current lineup, that feels risky. *The World* could convert cards to Spades, but my build focuses on Three of a Kind with Wily Joker and Queens for Shoot the Moon, so that's not optimal. *The Hanged Man*, however, is looking like a solid choice. It's a great opportunity to thin the deck of low-value cards, increasing the chances of drawing those critical Queens and Aces.\n\nI've got a hand with a decent mix: Spades (7, 5, 3, 2), Hearts (Ace, King, 3 with a Bonus), Clubs (9, 5). Scanning the deck metadata from previous turns, I see that Queens are key targets, and Aces are always playable. The obvious low-value candidates to remove are the 2S, 3S, 3H (even with the Bonus, it's not ideal for the build), 5S, 5C, 7S, and 9C.\n\nThe Hanged Man is the clear frontrunner for consistency. I can destroy the 2 of Spades and the 5 of Clubs. Let's make sure I'm doing the right thing. Based on the deck list, twos and fives seem to be the most common \"garbage\" cards to remove.\n\nI need to decide between The Hanged Man, Judgement, and The World. The World isn't a great fit for my build. Judgement is a wildcard. I could get a better Joker, but I could also get something worse and now I have a worse board. I'll need to sell a joker first, and with $4 left, I don't want to get stuck with an unusable Joker. My Jokers are all doing work, especially Juggler for Shoot the Moon. The Hanged Man is the safe, reliable play to improve my odds of drawing high-value cards, which are Queens and Aces.\n\nThe action format is `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> <hand_card_position2>`. I will take the Hanged Man at position 1 and target the 2 of Spades (position 4) and 5 of Clubs (position 9) to be destroyed. That makes sense.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's double-check again. The World doesn't help my 3OAK/Queen strategy. Judgement is too risky when the Jokers I have are all really good. *The Hanged Man* is the optimal choice for the build, as it helps to focus my deck towards higher value cards.\n\nFinal decision: I'm selecting The Hanged Man from pack position 1, destroying the 2 of Spades at hand position 4 and 5 of Clubs at hand position 9. Let's do this. JSON action: `select`, positions: [1, 4, 9].\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,4,9]"}
