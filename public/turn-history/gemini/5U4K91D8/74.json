{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Decision: Ante 4, Round 8**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the SHOP phase of Balatro, Ante 4, Round 8. I've got a tight $4 in the bank. My Joker lineup is pretty strong: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker boosting my 3OAK, Shoot the Moon for Queen-based Multi, Half Joker for small hands, and Card Sharp for multiplicative bonuses. I'm maxed out on Jokers at 5/5.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see a Flash Card for $5 (out of reach), Jupiter for $3 (irrelevant for my build), and a Standard Pack for $4, which is *exactly* what I can afford. Vouchers are out of the picture; I already bought the Tarot Merchant.\n\nMy game plan is heavily leaning on Three of a Kind, currently at Level 3. So, Jupiter is a no-go. Interest is a non-factor; $4 earns me zero interest, so there's no penalty to spending right now.\n\nThe real question is, Standard Pack, or not? The pack gives me a shot at getting more Queens (for Shoot the Moon) to increase my multi, or, I can try and improve my 3OAK consistency.\n\nI know the Standard Pack can help. I previously declared that I think it is, \"Perfect. That's a good deck/shop investment.\"\n\nRerolling is out, it's $5.\n\nTherefore, the Standard Pack is the obvious buy here. Let's do it!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
