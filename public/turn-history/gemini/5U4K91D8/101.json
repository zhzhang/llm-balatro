{"reasoning":"**Strategic Poker Decision Point**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 6, Round 11, and I've got $28. My core strategy revolves around maximizing Three of a Kind (3OAK) hands with a focus on using Half Joker and Card Sharp to amplify the mult on small hands. I'm leveraging these to get the maximum benefit on low card hands.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for Chips on 3OAK, Shoot the Moon for scaling, Half Joker for the mult and Card Sharp for the x3 mult. I am leveraging the Three of a Kind strategy and want to make the most of it.\n\nI've got a few key Vouchers in play that could be useful, and my recent play has consistently been 3OAK to leverage my cards. I need to make some key decisions. I see two boosters in the shop: the Jumbo Arcana Pack and the Celestial Pack.\n\nThe Flower Pot is in the shop, but it is not ideal for the build I am working on. \n\nMy initial thought was to prioritize leveling up 3OAK. This made the Celestial Pack the obvious choice to gain the Earth card.\n\nSo, I was ready to buy that. But, wait... I want to double-check my math.\n\nBuying the Celestial Pack first costs $4, leaving me at $24, which is just under the interest threshold of $25. But leveling up 3OAK is key for scaling, so it is the most direct way to get chips and mult. It is worth it in the long run.\n\nUltimately, I will take the action: buy_booster 2\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
