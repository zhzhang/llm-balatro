{"reasoning":"**Current Tactical Analysis: Round 8, Planet Pack Selection**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante is at 4/8, we're in Round 8 of the PLANET_PACK. I've got $14 to play with, and a pretty decent hand setup: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker (that's a sweet 100 chips for a 3OAK!), Shoot the Moon (good multiplier), Half Joker (another multiplier boost), and Card Sharp to leverage repeated hand types. My core strategy right now is undeniably centered around maximizing Three of a Kind (3OAK).\n\nMy inventory really synergizes with 3OAK, which is currently at Level 2, worth 50 chips and 5 mult. My goal here is to optimize that.\n\nI have five Planets to choose from: Venus, Pluto, Uranus, Earth, and Mars. Venus buffs 3OAK, which is my primary focus. Pluto levels up High Card. Uranus levels up Two Pair. Earth levels up Full House. Mars levels up Four of a Kind.\n\nGiven my build, Venus is the clear winner. Leveling up my 3OAK to Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) will give me a significant edge. The base stats for Level 2 3OAK are 50 chips and 5 mult, but with Venus, it will become 70 chips and 7 mult. This aligns perfectly with leveraging the Wily Joker and Card Sharp to rack up big scores.\n\nTherefore, the obvious play here is to select Venus. The action is `select 1`, and the resulting JSON is a confirmation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
