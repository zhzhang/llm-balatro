{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis: Ante 3, Round 4**\n\nAlright, let's break down this shop. I'm at Ante 3, Round 4, with $12 to work with. My Jokers are pretty solid: Juggler (hand size), Wily Joker (3 of a Kind Chips), Shoot the Moon (Queen Mult/Holo), Scholar (Ace Chips/Mult), and Showman (duplicates). I've got a Flush already leveled to 2, which is good.\n\nThe shop itself presents a few interesting options. Neptune is tempting for Straight Flush, but it's not a priority right now, given how rare they are. The Arcana Pack is always tempting; deck manipulation is key. Standard Pack could bring more Aces or Queens to the party. The Director's Cut is a good emergency button. And then there's the Reroll, which is not what I want.\n\nMy primary goal is to maximize score potential for Ante 3 and beyond. My Jokers synergize well: Scholar with Aces is a power play, Shoot the Moon with Queens is strong, and Wily Joker with 3 of a Kind is a solid base. The Arcana Pack is likely the highest-value play here for tuning my deck, as it can get me more Aces or help me lean into the Flush I used last round.\n\nI'm thinking:\n\n1.  **Buy the Arcana Pack ($4).** That leaves me with $8.\n2.  I'll see what's inside the Arcana Pack, of course.\n3.  Then I have $8. Should I buy the Standard Pack ($4)? (I'll have $4 left over)\n4.  Maybe keeping $4, just to get that interest on the next round!\n\nI need to decide about selling a Joker. Showman is interesting, but having more duplicates is useful for stacking Scholars or Shoot the Moons. Juggler's extra hand size is valuable but maybe I could find something better.\n\nAlright, the action is going to be `buy_booster 1`, the Arcana Pack. This is definitely the best move. Arcana packs are almost always better than Standard for a targeted deck upgrade (Aces/Queens). The interest calculation also makes sense; keep at least $5 for that extra dollar.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
