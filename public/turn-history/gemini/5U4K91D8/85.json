{"reasoning":"**The Strategy Evolves: A Symphony of Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, Round 9. I'm sitting on $6. My Joker slots are maxed out, and my build centers around the mighty Three of a Kind (3OAK). My primary goal is to optimize scoring for 3OAK, but I need to make the right choices in this shop.\n\nMy initial thought was to pick up either \"Celestial Pack\" ($4) to level my 3OAK, or a \"Jumbo Standard Pack\" ($6) for the potential of additional power cards, but the \"Antimatter\" voucher ($10) looms large. A sixth Joker slot would be an absolute game-changer. My instincts lean towards saving for the long game. However, the immediate temptation to pick up a planet (Earth for 3OAK) is real.\n\nI see \"To Do List\" ($4) requires me to sell a joker. It doesn't seem to make sense to sell a contributing joker at this stage. Mercury ($3) is a tempting option for leveling a pair, but I am focused on 3OAK. I should hold off.\n\nThe \"Celestial Pack\" is the top option to help 3OAK but I can get better value by saving for the Antimatter voucher, which will provide a huge boost.\n\nI take a moment to evaluate my current jokers. \"Shoot the Moon\" is Holo and gives additional multiplier per Queen. \"Card Sharp\" is good for the first round bonus. \"Half Joker\" is giving additional Mult, and \"Wily Joker\" is adding some chips. My current build is very strong for the small hands that are 3OAK.\n\nWith the Antimatter voucher, I'll need $10. My money plus the next round's interest and reward would be enough. So I'll go for it. But should I play the round now or later? My 3OAK is slightly weak, but the Small Blind shouldn't be a problem. Buying the Celestial Pack would give me $2, which isn't enough to secure Antimatter in the next shop. I should skip the round.\n\nI quickly check the other options. The shop card \"Mercury\" seems not useful. The \"Jumbo Standard Pack\" would add an additional power card to my deck, but is not as impactful as Antimatter.\n\nI'm thinking: The best strategic move is \"round_select\". I can revisit the shop in a few rounds and buy the Antimatter voucher with no risk.\n\nAs a final check, let's think again about the order of the cards. I see that \"Card Sharp\" *is* dependent on whether I play the 3OAK first. This should be optimal. So, I will be fine.\n\nMy final move is to save for the Antimatter voucher: `{\"action\": \"round_select\"}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
