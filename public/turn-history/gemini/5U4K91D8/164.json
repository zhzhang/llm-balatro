{"reasoning":"**Analysis of a High-Stakes Hand**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante is 7/8, it's Round 17, and I'm staring down \"The Arm\" boss blind (though, thankfully, Chicot is disabling that nonsense). My goal? 70,000 chips. Right now, I'm sitting at 17,025. I have a mere three hands left, and two discards, a hand size of 9, and I need to make some serious magic happen.\n\nLooking at my inventory, the jokers are critical: Juggler gives me the bigger hand size, Wily Joker is +100 chips on a 3OAK, Shoot the Moon grants +13 mult per Queen (plus +10 Holo mult), Half Joker gives +20 mult if the hand size is <= 3, Card Sharp multiplies by x3 if the hand has been played, and Chicot does a solid x1.5 mult for polychrome. I also have \"The Lovers\" consumable, but it's not relevant here.\n\nThe hand I'm holding is: 8 Spades, 7 Spades (mult, though useless if not played), K Hearts, Q Clubs (Gold), 9 Clubs, 3 Clubs, A Diamonds, 9 Diamonds, and 3 Diamonds. The last hand was a Three of a Kind (3OAK), which, thankfully, activated Card Sharp. My plan is to ride that bonus to victory.\n\nI need a Three of a Kind to trigger: Wily Joker, Half Joker, Card Sharp, Shoot the Moon, and Chicot bonuses.\n\nI have pairs of Nines and Threes. \"The Lovers\" is no help. So, what are the odds? I have 2 discards and the deck has 33 cards, 9 of which are Nines. The odds are good!\n\nI have to choose whether to ditch to find a third Nine or a third Three, or play some weak hand. Let's ditch to find a third Nine or another Queen.\n\nI have 9 of Clubs and 9 of Diamonds. The cards to go are: 8S, 7S, KH, 3C, AD, and 3D. But I can only discard 5 cards. Which ones do I want to ditch?\n\nI have the 3s and 9s. But with my deck count, 9s are more plentiful. This is a game of probability.\n\nI'm definitely fishing for a 9 or a Queen.\n\nI'll discard the 8S, 7S, KH, 3C, AD, and 3D. Maximum discard is 5 cards.\n\nSo, I discard: 8S, 7S, KH, 3C, AD. This leaves me with QC, 9C, 9D, and 3D.\n\nOkay, let's look at the numbers. Nines in deck: 9. Queens: 4. Total cards: 33. The odds are favorable.\n\nLet's calculate the score:\n\nBase Chips: 70 (Level 3 3OAK).\n\nCard Chips: 9 + 9 + 9 = 27.\n\nWily Joker: +100.\n\nTotal Chips: 70 + 27 + 100 = 197.\n\nBase Mult: 7 (Level 3 3OAK).\n\nShoot the Moon (Holo): +10.\n\nShoot the Moon (Queen in hand): +13 (if 1 Q), +26 (if 2 Qs).\n\nHalf Joker: +20.\n\nSubtotal Mult: 7 + 10 + 20 + 13 = 50.\n\nCard Sharp: x3.\n\nChicot: x1.5.\n\nTotal Mult: 50 * 3 * 1.5 = 225.\n\nTotal Score: 197 * 225 = 44,325.\n\nIf I get lucky and have 2 Queens: Mult = (7 + 10 + 20 + 26) * 4.5 = 63 * 4.5 = 283.5.\n\nScore: 197 * 283.5 = 55,849.5.\n\nAdd my current score: 17,025 + 44,325 = 61,350. Almost there. One more small hand or a second 3OAK finishes it.\n\nI'm discarding the 8 of Spades, 7 of Spades, King of Hearts, 3 of Clubs\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,6,7]"}
