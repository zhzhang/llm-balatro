{"reasoning":"**Current Balatro Dilemma: The Ante 3 Boss Looms**\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. Ante 3, $15 in the bank, and the Big Blind is about to hit. I've got a decent Joker lineup: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for chip generation on 3-of-a-kind, Shoot the Moon (Holo) which is huge with Queens, Scholar which is amazing with Aces, and Showman which offers potential duplicates. The shop's got some tempting options, but the Boss Blind is where my focus *has* to be.\n\nThe Boss is \"All face cards are drawn face down,\" which is The Mark, and this completely screws with my \"Shoot the Moon\" strategy since I need to hold Queens. Aces, thankfully, are safe. I'm heavily dependent on those Queens.\n\nHere are the options:\n\n1.  **Director's Cut ($10):** This is the safety net, letting me reroll the Boss. If I can't reroll this Boss, my \"Shoot the Moon\" strategy falls apart.\n2.  **Celestial Pack ($4):** Always a good buy to scale up base chips or mult.\n3.  **Even Steven ($4):** Not great since I'm focusing on Aces/Queens, which aren't even cards.\n4.  **Bull ($6):** Not worth it, I have Wily for chips.\n5.  **Mega Standard Pack ($8):** Could bring more Aces or Queens, but a bit of a gamble.\n\nSo, here's my plan: Buy Celestial Pack first. That's $4 spent, leaving me with $11. Then, I *absolutely* buy Director's Cut for $10, which leaves me with $1. Buying Celestial first seems solid. Even if the Ante 4 boss is bad, I'm covered.\n\n*Decision*: `buy_booster` 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
