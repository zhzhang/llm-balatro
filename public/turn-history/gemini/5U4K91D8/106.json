{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Ante 6, Round 11 - The Play's the Thing!**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're at Ante 6, round 11, with $18 in the bank and a decent Joker setup. I'm looking at this BLIND_SELECT stage and my immediate thought is to play the round, not skip. Here's why:\n\n*   **Economy is Key:** Skipping a blind, while tempting to \"save\" money, would be a mistake. We get $3 for beating the Small Blind, plus interest. That $3 will help sustain the economy. Plus, with the current Joker setup, the reward from the Small Blind (or even Big Blind) is easily achievable. This builds long-term sustainability to play more rounds.\n*   **The Joker Line-up is Solid:** I have a powerhouse group of Jokers: Juggler (hand size, static), Wily (chips, static), Shoot the Moon (mult, Queen-dependent), Half Joker (mult, static), Card Sharp (multiplicative), and Chicot (multiplicative). I did a quick check, and the current order *is* optimal. Additive effects (chips and mult) before the multiplicative effects are always the most beneficial.\n*   **The Math Checks Out:** I can easily hit the blind thresholds. A quick calculation shows that two rounds of 3-of-a-kind (3OAK) with the current Jokers will get me over the 20,000 chip requirement of the Small Blind (and likely the Big Blind too, depending on card draw). We can easily hit the 30k requirement and get the $4 reward.\n*   **Shop Access is Crucial:** Skipping means less shop access. We *need* the shop for two reasons: I need to buy planet cards like Mars (to level up my 3OAK) and tarot cards to manipulate the deck (get more Queens).\n*   **The Boss Blind is Trivial:** Chicot makes the Boss Blind irrelevant, so that's not a factor.\n\nThe intended hand type isn't a factor. And, while I *could* include the estimated chips, there's no requirement to and given my expertise, the game should understand the action is to play round to leverage the advantages of the next round. So, the action is `play_round`, and I'm sticking with it. No need to overcomplicate things here.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
