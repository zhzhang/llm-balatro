{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 5/8, Round 10, and I'm in the Shop phase. I've got a measly $2 in the bank after dropping $10 on Antimatter, and my Joker slots are fully occupied at 5/6, with a solid lineup. My current Jokers are Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, and Card Sharp. I have two consumable slots open.\n\nThe shop offerings are The Emperor ($3), Astronomer ($8), Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6), and Jumbo Standard Pack ($6). Reroll costs $5, and the next blind is the Big Blind. Clearly, nothing is affordable at first glance.\n\nI need to assess my options. Selling a Joker is a possibility to get The Emperor. Juggler and Half Joker would give me $2, Wily would also give $2, Shoot the Moon would give me $4, and Card Sharp would give me $3. But each Joker is important to my existing 3OAK-focused build:\n\n*   Shoot the Moon is Holo (+10 mult).\n*   Half Joker is +20 mult.\n*   Card Sharp is X3 mult.\n*   Wily is +100 chips.\n*   Juggler increases hand size, which helps in finding Queens or 3OAK sets.\n\nIf I sell Juggler for $2, I would have $4, which is enough to buy The Emperor ($3), leaving me with $1. That means I have to evaluate selling Juggler versus getting 2 tarot cards from The Emperor. Juggler's +1 hand size is probably the less valuable card in the build, but it's important to help find the cards I need. And given that my 6th Joker slot is open, I'd rather keep my core engine intact and hope to find something better next shop.\n\nSince I can't realistically afford anything without crippling my build, I'm going to pass. It's time to move on to the next round. I'll need to go to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
