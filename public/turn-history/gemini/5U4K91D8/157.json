{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decision**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 7, Round 16, and I'm in the Shop phase with $6. I've got a solid Joker setup: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for chips on 3OAK, Shoot the Moon for a hefty mult boost on Queens, Half Joker for mult with a small hand, Card Sharp for repeat hand multiplication, and Chicot to neutralize that nasty Boss effect. The Lovers consumable is in play, too. My current strategy is locked on Three of a Kind, which is level 3.\n\nLooking at the shop, Fibonacci is tempting, but it's $8, so that's out of the question. I can't afford it without selling a Joker, and I'm not doing that. The Arcana Pack, however, is $4, which I *can* afford. Given that I'm heading into the Boss Blind, and already have the right Jokers in play, that seems like the better play. Tarot cards from the Arcana Pack can be really impactful, maybe I get a Hermit or Temperance to build up my hand strength, or even something like Strength or Death to improve the deck.\n\nSo, the plan is to buy the Arcana Pack. That leaves me with $2. Then, it's straight to the Boss Blind. The buy is the best play here, as the Jokers are good, and the Arcana Pack may improve them.\n\nTherefore, the action I should take is \"buy\\_booster\" with a position of `[1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
