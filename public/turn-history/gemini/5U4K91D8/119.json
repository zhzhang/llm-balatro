{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Empty Shop, Strong Hand**\n\nOkay, so the game state is pretty clear. Ante is 6/8, Round 12, just finished the Shop after the Standard Pack. I'm sitting on $13, which means $2 interest. My Joker setup is maxed out: Juggler for the hand size, Wily Joker for the 3OAK chips, Shoot the Moon for Queen scaling, Half Joker for the mult boost on smaller hands, Card Sharp for the x3 mult on repeats, and Chicot to handle Boss Blinds and passively mult. I've also got two consumables, Death and The Lovers, but I can't use them here in the Shop. And the shop is empty. No cards, no boosters, no vouchers.\n\nThe question is, do I blow $5 on a reroll? Realistically, no. There's no space. My Joker slots and Consumable slots are full, so I'm not gaining anything by finding a Planet card. I'd have to sacrifice a consumable, which I don't want to do. Death and The Lovers are way too valuable for setting up those 3OAKs and Queen synergies later. And, dropping down to $8 after rerolling just kills my interest. Nope.\n\nSo, using a consumable isn't an option. Rerolling isn't efficient. That means *round_select* is the only logical move.\n\nMy current hand is solid. The 3OAK build with Wily, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Shoot the Moon is pretty lethal. Chicot buys me time on those Boss Blinds and adds that passive mult. I've got a strong hand ready for the Big Blind, probably consistently hitting 30k+. Money is best saved for future shops when I might actually *need* something, or if I get a voucher. The full $13 is going to give me $2 interest.\n\nJust making sure… I'm not selling a Joker, are we? Juggler is the weakest, but that hand size is critical for finding those Queens to feed Shoot the Moon. The others are essential. Got it.\n\nFinal answer: *round_select*. Let's go.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
