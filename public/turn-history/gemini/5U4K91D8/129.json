{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis for Ante 7**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, Round 13, facing \"The Eye\" blind, though Chicot's already neutered its effect. My primary objective is still to maximize the 3OAK strategy. Right now, I have $11. My Joker setup is looking pretty solid: Juggler helps with hand size, Wily Joker pumps up 3OAK chips, Shoot the Moon adds a multiplicative bonus based on Queens, Half Joker is great since I'm aiming for hands of three cards or fewer, Card Sharp is the money maker repeating 3OAKs, and Chicot is a global multiplier enabler. I also have the consumables Death and The Lovers.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see Judgement, The Moon, and Reroll. 3OAK is only at level 1 right now, which is the immediate issue.\n\n*   `Judgement` sounds like a bad idea. I have a full Joker board, and selling a key one like Wily Joker or Shoot the Moon is out of the question. Juggler is the weakest link, but still useful for hand size and finding Queens. The risk of getting a worse Joker outweighs the potential reward, particularly since I'm trying to level up my planets to stay relevant.\n*   `The Moon` isn't relevant. It makes Clubs, but I'm not running a Flush Five build.\n*   `Reroll` is tempting, but it costs $5, leaving me with only $6. That's not ideal for interest generation. I could *maybe* hit an Earth planet, but it's not worth the risk.\n\nSo, here's the breakdown: saving $10 is important for maximizing interest. The shop options are sub-optimal for my current game plan. Judgement is a trap, Reroll is risky and expensive. The best play is to bank the money and move to the next blind. I need the added income to either buy planets, or re-roll later. The Blue Seal card from last turn gives a chance at getting some planet cards. `round_select` is the most stable and logical move right now.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
