{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Decision: Play Round**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase, facing the Big Blind with an Ante of 2. I need 1200 chips to clear, which is trivial given my current scoring engine. I have a potential Uncommon Tag for skipping, but that's not optimal right now. The upcoming Boss blind is the \"one hand type\" condition, which is actually beneficial since I am optimized for Three of a Kind.\n\nCurrently, I have $7 and a full complement of five Jokers: Juggler (hand size), Wily (chips for 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (Holo mult/Queen mult), Scholar (chips/Ace mult), and Showman (duplicate items). I also have \"The Sun\" consumable, but it's unusable at this stage. My last hand scored a cool 4160 chips with a 3OAK.\n\nNow, my options. Option 1: Play the round. This gives me $4 base, interest, and hands remaining. There's no real risk; I can easily crush the 1200 chip requirement. The opportunity is shop access after. Option 2: Skip. The reward is the Uncommon Tag, which gives me a free Uncommon Joker *but* I'd have to sell a Joker in the *next* shop to get it.\n\nThe Big Blind reward is $4. I'm already set up to score well beyond the needed chips. If I skip, I get a tag that makes an Uncommon Joker free. Let's review my Joker set. Wily, Shoot the Moon, and Scholar are all scoring engines. Juggler is utility and Showman is utility/rarity. Right now, I'm at 4k+ chips on 3OAKs. I am well ahead. I can easily surpass the upcoming Big Blind's 1200, and the Boss's 1600 requirement. Is an Uncommon Tag worth skipping a shop? Uncommon Jokers vary wildly. I have Showman, which makes it more likely I see specific types of cards.\n\nIf I play the round, I get the $4 reward, the interest, and a hand bonus. With my current $7, I will end up with $12-14. This is good because it gives me actual buying power.\n\nThe Boss blind, which is \"Play only 1 hand type\". This is fine because my build is heavily Three of a Kind focused.\n\nGenerally, playing is better early on to build interest and see more shop items. Right now, if I skip, I have to sell a card to even take the reward. The \"The Sun\" consumable is sitting there, but it's for later. I can't use it right now.\n\nMy action will be `play_round`. This is because I have a strong scoring setup with full Joker slots. Playing the round gives me money and shop access, which is more valuable than a random Uncommon Joker that I might not have room for or might not fit my build.\n\nThe initial JSON was correct, but I need to include `nulls` where appropriate, per the schema. After a double-check, my final choice is to `play_round`.\n\n**Final Action:** `play_round`\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
