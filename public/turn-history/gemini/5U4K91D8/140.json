{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Shop and Strategizing for the Next Round**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 7/8, Round 14, Shop phase. I have a single dollar – not nearly enough to buy anything in the shop. Walkie Talkie is $4, the Celestial Pack is $6, and a reroll is $5. No dice.\n\nI have The Lovers (a Wild card) and Strength (a +1 rank boost) in my consumables, but those are round-specific. I can't use them here. So, the shop is a dead end for now.\n\nLet's look at my Jokers. I've got Juggler, Wily (+100 Chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (+13 Mult per Queen in hand, +10 Mult holo), Half Joker (+20 Mult if hand size <= 3), Card Sharp (X3 Mult if hand already played this round), and Chicot (Disables Boss Blind, X1.5 Mult poly).\n\nMy strategy is still focused on Three of a Kind. Ordering these jokers for maximum efficiency is key. Wily should be early for the early chip boost. Shoot the Moon, Half Joker are both +Mult. Card Sharp and Chicot are xMult, and since you always want to trigger +Mult before xMult, they should be at the end. The utility of Juggler at the start means that the ordering is:\n\n1.  Juggler (hand size)\n2.  Wily (+100 Chips)\n3.  Shoot the Moon (+10 Mult holo, held Queens)\n4.  Half Joker (+20 Mult)\n5.  Card Sharp (X3 Mult)\n6.  Chicot (X1.5 Mult)\n\nThat order looks perfect. Chips -> +Mult -> xMult.\n\nSince I can't buy anything and the consumables are for round play, it's clear: I need to move to the round selection screen. I'm going to set my action to `round_select`\n\nFor round select, I am now thinking about the hands to play. My intended hand type is, of course, a `three of a kind`. I don't need to estimate chips right now, but it's always useful to be prepared. If I were to estimate the chips for the *next* 3OAK, let's see: Level 2 blind is 50x5, and a Wily provides 100 extra chips.\n\nChips: 50 (base) + 100 (Wily) = 150.\nMult: 5 (base) + 10 (Shoot the Moon holo) + 20 (Half Joker) + \\[Queens in hand \\* 13].\n\nAssume 0 Queens: Mult = 35.\n\n150 \\* 35 = 5,250.\n\nIf Card Sharp triggers (X3): 15,750.\n\nIf Chicot triggers (X1.5): 15,750 \\* 1.5 = 23,625.\n\nIf Queens are in hand, this goes up significantly.\n\nBut the action is round select, and I don't need to actually estimate, or adjust the intention.\n\nSo to be clear:\n\n*   `action`: \"round\\_select\"\n*   `positions`: null\n*   `intended_hand_type`: null (or \"three of a kind\")\n*   `estimated_chips`: null\n\nJust making sure, let's quickly double-check that the joker order is still perfect:\n\n1.  Juggler\n2.  Wily (+100 Chips)\n3.  Shoot the Moon (+10 Mult holo)\n4.  Half Joker (+20 Mult)\n5.  Card Sharp (X3 Mult)\n6.  Chicot (X1.5 Mult)\n\nYes, that's still the optimal sequence.\n\nFinal action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
