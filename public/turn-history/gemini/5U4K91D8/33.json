{"reasoning":"**Strategic Pause: Evaluating Options and Maximizing Value**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 3, Round 4. The Small Blind is 3, which isn't a huge hurdle. I've got $8, and my Jokers are Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Scholar, and Showman. My hand levels are Flush 2, Three of a Kind 1, and so on. Right now, I can see a *Neptune* card that upgrades Straight Flush (not relevant here), a *Standard Pack* for $4 (which could give me more Aces or Queens to synergize with Scholar/Shoot the Moon), a *Reroll* option for $5 (too expensive right now), and the option to just save my money.\n\nMy initial thought is to save. Interest is king, especially early on. I get $1 for every $5 I have. Going to the next round with $8 means I get $1 interest, and maybe a better shop next time. Buying the Standard Pack would net me zero interest. That Standard Pack might contain cards that would let me play my Jokers better.\n\nThe question then becomes: Is the Standard Pack worth sacrificing the interest? My current build leans on Aces and Queens. If I get more of either, Scholar will buff me by +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace, while Shoot the Moon grants +13 Mult per Queen in my hand. Showman might influence the card shop, though this seems unlikely as I just used Wheel of Fortune.\n\nHere's the scoring order. It helps to have it memorized:\n1.  'On played' Jokers (Green Joker, etc.)\n2.  Played cards score (Scholar chips/mult triggers here)\n3.  Held-in-hand (Shoot the Moon +13 Mult per Queen)\n4.  'Independent' Jokers (Shoot the Moon Holo edition +10 Mult, other +mult jokers)\n5.  Wait, editions on jokers (like Holo) usually trigger in step 5 (Independent Jokers) left-to-right.\n\nThe Standard Pack is $4. I have $8. With $8, I get to move to the next round with $9 and another chance at a better hand. So, my best move is to save money and accumulate interest. It's a slightly better gamble than buying the $4 Standard Pack for only playing cards. I can check the shop for *Neptune* (useless), *Standard Pack* (probably not), *Director's Cut* (too expensive), and *Reroll* (no).\n\nI'll proceed to the next round to start accumulating interest.\n\n**Action: `round_select`**\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
