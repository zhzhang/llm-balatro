{"reasoning":"**Card Selection Analysis: Strategic Optimization**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, Round 13. My focus is still on Three of a Kind (3OAK), that's the current strategy, and this is where I want to put my emphasis. We've got $11 and these three cards in front of me to pick from in the Standard Pack.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my thinking: first, let's keep the core strategy in mind: I need to maximize 3OAK potential, which is currently at Level 1, and so there's a big scaling issue. The Half Joker is a constraint since I need to keep the hand size at 3 or fewer cards to get its full potential. Also, I've got Shoot the Moon, and so Queens are always desirable. Card Sharp means I want to play the same hand more than once.\n\nThe cards are: a Holo King of Hearts with a Wild Card enhancement (potentially useful for the +10 mult and retrigger, but doesn't synergize with the core strategy of building up the 3OAK), a 9 of Spades with a Bonus enhancement that *also* has a Blue Seal (this is critical: it creates a Planet card for the final played poker hand of the round, exactly what I need for leveling up the 3OAK), and a Holo 3 of Spades (just flat mult).\n\nNow, the Blue Seal on the 9 of Spades is really the key. I need to start getting Earth cards to level up the 3OAK. Earth cards make my life a lot easier, and this is the easiest way to do it. The King of Hearts gives a nice +10 mult, and the holos are also good for the build.\n\nLet's look at the King again. If the King is Red Seal, it would be extremely strong. But it doesn't give me what I need for this round: scaling and an Earth card, with the 3OAK strategy.\n\nThe choice is clear. The King of Hearts is good, but the 9 of Spades with the Blue Seal is the way to go. I need to get the levels up, and it's a Bonus card with an important \"creates the planet card\" bonus. I'll take it. I want a Blue Seal to get those Earth cards.\n\nSo, I'll select the 9 of Spades: `select 2`. No, there are no targets needed. This is a deck building phase.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
