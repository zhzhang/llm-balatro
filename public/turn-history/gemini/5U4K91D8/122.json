{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis and Action Plan**\n\nOkay, here's the game state. It's Round 13, ante 6/8, big blind 30,000 chips. I need to hit 30,000 chips to move forward. My current hand is a mix, but the key is the Queen of Spades, two Jacks and the \"Death\" tarot card. I have several Jokers, including Half Joker, Shoot the Moon, and Card Sharp, which could give substantial Multipliers. My strategy hinges on making a Three of a Kind (3OAK), keeping hand size to 3 or less and also keeping the Queen in hand to trigger the Shoot the Moon Joker bonus.\n\nInitially, I considered using \"Death\" to convert the King into a third Jack, but upon double-checking the card's mechanics, I realized that I would be converting the \"left\" card into the \"right\" card. This means I'd need to have the Jack I want to keep on the right and the card I want to become a Jack on the left. This requires hand rearrangement, and I'd prefer to avoid that. So, I will avoid using the tarot.\n\nInstead, I have 3 discards left. Discarding is free, and I can discard some junk.\n\nI have decided to discard 5 cards: the 3 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, 10 of Hearts and the 3 of Diamonds from positions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10. These have been identified as low-value cards, with no immediate utility. I will keep the 7 of Spades since it has some mult value. I'll discard these 5 to get the potential for a third Jack or more Queens. This is also keeping the hand size at 3 to take advantage of the Half Joker, so I get the additional +20 mult value.\n\nMy resulting JSON Action is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"discard\",\n  \"positions\": [4, 5, 6, 7, 10]\n}\n```\n\nThis should be a good play, avoiding the potential for wasted tarots and setting me up for a high-value 3OAK on the next hand.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,10]"}
