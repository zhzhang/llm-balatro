{"reasoning":"**Final Decision: Maximize Planet Chances**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 8, aiming for the next blind threshold. My strategy is Three of a Kind (3OAK), level 4 with a solid Joker setup: Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot. The goal is to get a reliable, high score.\n\nLooking at the current pack, I've got a choice. The Magician gives Lucky cards (which could be decent), The Tower gives a Stone card (which does nothing for a 3OAK build), and The High Priestess offers up to 2 random planet cards. My hand currently is 3 Aces.\n\nI can't just pick something; I need to use the consumable (\"The Lovers\") first. If I take The Lovers without using it, I only get 1 planet. If I use it, I can use the High Priestess to take 2 planets. But if I don't, I will only get one planet. And I like the idea of two, because Venus is *amazing* for this build and even other planets are generally useful.\n\nI initially thought that Lucky cards via The Magician could *potentially* provide a higher score (with a high-roll), I need to be *reliable* in the last ante. So, reliable upgrades via planets is more important. The goal is to reach that blind (or surpass the score) *every time*.\n\nWith The Lovers enhancing the Jack of Spades (arbitrary), and selecting High Priestess after, I should get 2 planets!\n\nAction: `use_consumable`\nPositions: `[1, 2]`\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,2]"}
