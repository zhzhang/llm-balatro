{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Optimization: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Round 14, Ante 7, a little glitch in the matrix there with the Ante. $20 in the bank. Got a solid Joker lineup: Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot (Polychrome). The Lovers consumable is ready, and I've got a killer set of Vouchers: Paint Brush, Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Blank, and Antimatter.\n\nMy go-to strategy is still that three-of-a-kind build with small hands and Queens. So the shop? Telescope is *the* key here. Celestial Packs guarantee the Earth card for Three of a Kind. That's a massive level-up.\n\n*   **Priority:** Telescope for $10. Absolutely essential for the 3OAK strategy. Getting that Earth card will immediately boost my chips and multiplier.\n*   **Secondary:** Jumbo Celestial Packs ($6 each). Since I'm grabbing Telescope, these are basically Earth card packs. Two of these will be perfect for leveling up my Three of a Kind build.\n*   **Tertiary:** Strength (Tarot, $3). Good for deck manipulation, but not a priority over the immediate power of Telescope and Celestial Packs.\n*   **Discard:** Walkie Talkie (Joker, $4). It's a nice bonus, but I have no space for it in my current Joker lineup.\n\nSo, the play?\n\n1.  **Buy Telescope first ($10).**\n2.  **Buy a Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6).**\n3.  **Then, buy Strength ($3).**\n\nI'm checking the money, I have $20, Telescope ($10) + Jumbo Pack ($6) + Strength ($3) = $19. Perfect, I'll have $1 left for interest.\n\nThe question of *when* to buy the voucher is critical. Does it affect the packs already in the shop? Absolutely. The wording, \"Celestial Packs *always* contain...\" means buying Telescope *before* opening the packs is essential. This guarantees the Earth card, maximizing my 3OAK strategy.\n\nThe command list is `buy_voucher 1`. Telescope is in position 1 of the vouchers.\n\nNo reason to sell or rearrange Jokers. My order is optimal: Chicot (X1.5) and Card Sharp (X3) are multiplicative, so their order doesn't matter.\n\n**Action: `buy_voucher 1` (Telescope).**\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
