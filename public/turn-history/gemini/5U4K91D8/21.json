{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Strategy: Focusing on Long-Term Value**\n\nOkay, here we are in the shop after winning that Big Blind. I've got $19, and the Boss Blind is coming up, which is a \"play only one hand type\" scenario. Given my current setup, that's not a problem at all. My focus is on Three of a Kind, but I can also lean into high-card plays with Scholar and Shoot the Moon.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for chips on 3OAK, Shoot the Moon (Holo) for straight mult, Scholar for chip/mult generation (Aces), and Showman for card duplication. No room to buy any of the Jokers in the shop at the moment - Wrathful Joker for Spades is useless, and Business Card is useless too, though it's the right price.\n\nI need to decide what to do with my cash. I could buy a Booster Pack, either Jumbo or Standard, to improve the deck. But looking at the available items, I think the Blank Voucher for $10 is the smart play here. It's a long-term investment towards Antimatter, and it's something I can't guarantee will be available in future shops. My goal is 1600 chips to win the blind and Blank seems like the way to go here.\n\nRerolling isn't appealing - those Jokers aren't a great fit. Selling a Joker is also completely out of the question since they are all high-value. Using The Sun is no good.\n\nOkay, so the Blank Voucher it is. I'm going to buy that first.\n\nI also considered Joker placement - making sure that the order of the mult/chip boosters is correct - so my current scoring is: cards played -> Scholar triggers -> Shoot the Moon triggers -> Shoot the Moon Holo Mult applies. Not that the order matters since I have additive mult.\n\nAction: buy_voucher 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
