{"reasoning":"**My Current Thought Process**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 6, Round 12, and I'm in the SHOP phase with $21. My Joker setup is already pretty solid for a Three of a Kind strategy, which is what I'm aiming for. I have Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot – a decent mix of chip multipliers and some hand-size optimization. I also have Death and The Lovers as consumables.\n\nMy immediate goal is to prepare for the upcoming Big Blind. Death is a key consumable here, especially if I can duplicate a Queen card for Shoot the Moon's mult increase. The Lovers can't be used in the shop, but it offers a free wild card if I use it in the hand. The Lovers isn't as good as I'd like because it's single-target. My shop options are two Standard Packs. I'm not seeing any amazing Jokers or Vouchers.\n\nI need to decide what to do with my money. Rerolling the shop costs $5, leaving me with $16. If I buy both packs, it's $8 total, leaving me with $13. But, since the shop is devoid of Jokers, and my Joker slots are full, I don't think there's much point.\n\nI already acquired the Lovers from an Emperor card, and I can't use it in the shop since it needs card targets from my hand, which are not currently available.\n\nMy initial thought was to buy both packs, but I'm thinking about it. Standard Packs are hit or miss.\n\nI have $21, and interest is a factor, but caps at $25.\n\nI should see if there is anything I can do, such as using my consumables or checking for any additions to my hand. My hand size is 8 (8 base + 1 Juggler + 1 Paint Brush).\n\nI could reroll the shop, but I'm better off going with the standard packs.\n\nSince I am focused on a Three of a Kind strategy, I need to look for high cards or planet cards to increase multipliers.\n\nRerolling doesn't make sense since I can't buy any planet cards since my inventory is full.\n\nGiven my setup, buying the Standard Packs is a low-risk move to potentially improve the deck and build.\nI am close to the interest cap.\n\nSo I need to buy a standard pack. I should do that first.\n\nI will buy Standard Pack 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
