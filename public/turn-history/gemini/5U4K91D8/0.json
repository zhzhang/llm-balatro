{"reasoning":"**The Early Game Gamble: Charm vs. Cash**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the very beginning of the run – Blind Select, Ante 1, with a measly $4 in my pocket and an empty inventory. The Small Blind looms, requiring 300 chips. Two intriguing tags are pulling me in different directions: the \"Charm Tag\" (Mega Arcana Pack) and the \"Holographic Tag\" (Free Holographic Joker) on the Big Blind. The boss blind is debuffed (600 chips needed).\n\nMy initial thought is the standard play: pay the Small Blind. I’d get $3 plus some interest, probably about $10-11 in total, and immediate access to the shop. That's usually the go-to for early-game money and Joker acquisition. But is it the *best* move here?\n\nThe \"Charm Tag\" is tempting. A Mega Arcana Pack for free is a major power spike, especially early on. Those Tarot cards could give me immediate value: gold, crucial enhancements, or even help build my deck and/or Jokers. Hermit, Temperance, Emperor, or Priestess cards would be huge. Since I only have $4, I can't afford much in the first shop anyway (the Jokers usually cost more). So, a free pack is very solid.\n\nSkipping the Small Blind gets me the pack, but no shop visit and no immediate money. It does set me up for the Big Blind with the Holographic Tag as well. However, skipping two blinds in Ante 1 seems risky. I'd enter the Boss with no Jokers and very little money.\n\nThinking it through, the Charm Tag is better in the early game. If I play the Small Blind, I get some money. The Mega Arcana pack and the shop visit are roughly equivalent in terms of power spikes. However, a free pack is stronger early on. I see \"Big Blind Tag: Holographic Tag\". That is also very strong.\n\nI'm leaning towards the skip: it's a very common and strong play.\n\nSo, the action is `skip_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
