{"reasoning":"**Strategic Refinement for Ante 6**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante 6, Phase SHOP. $21 in the bank. The objective is clear: take down that Ante 8 Boss. My current strategy, as I see it, is centered around a robust Three of a Kind (3OAK) engine, and I've got a strong Joker lineup to make it happen. I'm relying on Wily Joker for those juicy chip boosts, Shoot the Moon to ramp up the mult, the Half Joker and Card Sharp for multiplicative bonuses, Chicot, the legendary, to disable boss effects, and Juggler, which extends the hand size, and will allow for more cards.\n\nMy hand levels are Three of a Kind is Level 1 - 30 chips, 3 mult.\n\nNow, let's analyze the shop. \"Judgement\" is tempting, creating a random Joker for $3, but I'm already at the Joker limit, and all my Jokers are actively synergizing with my 3OAK strategy. Juggler is the most replaceable. \"The Moon\" converts cards to Clubs for $3. Not ideal for this 3OAK build.\n\nMy top priority has to be leveling up that 3OAK hand. Given my $21, the \"Jumbo Celestial Pack\" for $6 is the clear choice. It gives me a shot at \"Earth\", which is what I need to level up 3OAK. A no-brainer. After the purchase, I'll have $15 left, with $20 bringing me $4 interest.\n\nTherefore, the action is crystal clear: I'm going to `buy_booster` at position `1` and hope for an Earth sighting.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
