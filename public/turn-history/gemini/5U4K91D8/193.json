{"reasoning":"**Strategic Ante 8 Boss Blind Prep**\n\nOkay, here we are, facing the Ante 8 Boss Blind, and it's time to refine this run. I'm sitting at $9, the build is laser-focused on Three of a Kind (3OAK), keeping Queens in hand, and leaning into small hands to maximize synergies. With my current money, I have to make the most optimal decisions.\n\nI've got the following options: Credit Card for a buffer ($1), The Tower to make a card Stone ($3), Celestial Pack for 3OAK upgrade ($4), Mega Standard Pack for deck filler ($8), and Reroll Surplus ($10). Reroll is out of reach. The Mega Standard pack is tempting for adding to the deck, but given my position in the run, the Celestial Pack looks like the best option for immediate scaling to 3OAK.\n\nI will use my Telescope voucher to ensure the strongest play, 3OAK, appears in the pack, since upgrading my 3OAK will provide the best scaling. So, I will **buy_booster 1** to get that Celestial Pack. With $5 left, I could buy the The Tower, but I will decide after the round.\n\nAfter the purchase, I'll upgrade the 3OAK to level 6 and pick the best Planet Card available. That's the core of the strategy to survive this boss blind.\n\nMy joker setup is already optimized for maximum damage. The Juggler is in slot 1 and the order is perfect for the way the calculations happen: Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp and Chicot. The key here is additive mults before multiplicative mults.\n\n*   1.  **Buy Booster 1:** This is the best play to level up the deck.\n*   2.  **Pick Planet Card:** Choose Earth\n*   3.  **Use $5 left to decide on further decisions.**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
