{"reasoning":"**Analysis Paralysis, But With a Plan**\n\nOkay, here we go. Boss Blind: The Mark, Ante 3/8, Round 7. I need 1,624 more chips. Only three hands left. This is where it gets interesting... The boss effect, face cards down. This hand... Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Scholar, and Card Sharp are my jokers. Okay, let's analyze the hand. I've got a 9S, 8S, 7S, a face-down card, a 2H, another face-down card, another face-down card, a 2C, and a final face-down card. The last hand was a pair, meaning Card Sharp's x3 Mult is primed for any repeat hand type this round.\n\nMy immediate thought is to play the pair of 2s I have. It's a quick calculation. 10 base chips, plus 4 from the cards themselves, which is 14 chips. I can't forget the +10 Holo, and, if there are any Queens +13 per Queen held in hand. Then the x3 multiplier from Card Sharp. It's not enough to get me to the goal.\n\nI need to aim higher. I'm thinking 3-of-a-Kind, preferably with the Wily Joker bonus! And, since the face cards are down, I need to know: if any are Queens, they provide +13 Mult each. I've got to find that third 2... or find an Ace! \n\nLet's look at the remaining cards. The deck has two more 2s, two Aces, and a bunch of face cards in the deck. The 4 unknown face-down cards are Jacks, Queens, and Kings... Now, the Juggler Joker gives me an extra hand card, but there is no point in having one! Discards are crucial. I've got two. I should ditch those useless 9S, 8S, 7S cards immediately. But wait, I may have Queens in the face-down cards. Queens give a great multiplier!\n\nIf I *do* draw an Ace I can try playing a high card, with the Scholar bonus (+20 Chips, +4 Mult). With at least a Queen in hand, I can reach 1,334 chips. Not quite enough.\n\nBut, if I hit that third 2 for a 3-of-a-Kind? Base is 50 chips, plus 6 chip bonus, plus 100 Wily Joker bonus, which is 156 chips. Holo joker gives 15 mult. 156 * 15 equals a win!\n\nNow, the best option is 3 of a Kind, the secondary option is high card.\n\nI will definitely ditch the 9S, 8S, and 7S to find the third 2! \n\nThe action: discard. Positions: 1, 2, 3.\n\nI'll check the discards again - I'm discarding 1, 2, 3.\n\nIt's time. I'm discarding 1, 2, and 3. I'm feeling confident! Let's get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3]"}
