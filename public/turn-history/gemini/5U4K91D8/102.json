{"reasoning":"**My Decision for the Celestial Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 11, Celestial Pack open, $24 in the bank. My primary strategy is \"Three of a Kind\" (3OAK), heavily supported by Jokers like Wily (chip boost for 3OAK), Card Sharp (X3 mult on repeats), and Half Joker (mult boost for 3-card hands). I also have Juggler and Shoot the Moon, which impact hand size and Queen play, respectively. I also have several vouchers, but those aren't relevant for this decision.\n\nThe goal is always to maximize score, and right now, 3OAK is my go-to. I'm offered three Planet cards: Neptune (Straight Flush), Earth (Full House), and Saturn (Straight).\n\nImmediately, I'm thinking, \"Where's Mars? That's the 3OAK planet!\" Unfortunately, it's not present. So, I need to evaluate these options. Neptune is out. Straight Flushes are rare for me, so I never play them. Saturn is a harder hand to hit. That leaves Earth (Full House).\n\nFull House *contains* a 3OAK, which means Wily Joker triggers. But Full House requires five cards, which is bad since it means Half Joker won't trigger (\"3 or fewer cards\" condition). So, there is no direct synergy for 3OAK, but it's the closest thing.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n*   Neptune: Very rare for my strategy, not beneficial.\n*   Earth: Full House. Might be useful as a safety net if I can't find a 3OAK. Earth *contains* a 3OAK, which activates Wily Joker but not Half Joker.\n*   Saturn: Harder to hit. Breaks the \"hold Queens\" strategy more than Earth does.\n\nGiven the Card Sharp joker, I'll benefit by having a repeat hand. If I'm forced to play a Full House, the Earth card provides a good \"safety net\".\n\nSo, the optimal choice is Earth (Position 2). Skipping is almost never the best option.\n\nI need to generate a JSON response to indicate my action. The desired action is `select`, and I'm selecting position 2. Intended hand type and estimated chips are null for this type of action. I double-check the schema and generate the following JSON: `{\"action\":\"select\",\"positions\":[2],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}`.\n\nI re-checked everything. Yes, Earth is the best option.\n\nI re-checked my JSON response and decided to refine it a bit, while still keeping the action valid. I will provide `{\"action\":\"select\",\"positions\":[2],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
