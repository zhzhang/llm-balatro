{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Strategy for \"The Mark\" Blind**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Current Blind: The Mark. Goal: 4000 chips, I'm at 2376, so I need 1624 more. I have 3 hands remaining, 3 discards. My hand is: 10S, ?, 8H, 6H, 2H, ?, 7C, 2C, ?. The discards are free, I should use them.\n\nMy Jokers are: Juggler (hand size +1), Wily Joker (+100 Chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (+13 Mult per Queen, +10 Holo Mult), Scholar (Aces: +20 Chips, +4 Mult), and Card Sharp (x3 Mult if hand type repeated). Card Sharp is active because I played a Pair last round.\n\nMy current hand contains a pair of 2s, but any pair will be multiplied by 3 because of Card Sharp.\n\nIf I play a Pair of 2s: 14 chips base, 2 mult. With Shoot the Moon (Holo) +10 mult, the result is (2 + 10) \\* 14 \\* 3 = 504. Not enough to win.\n\nIf I play a 3 of a Kind of 2s, it's 50 base, 5 mult (Level 2). Wily Joker adds +100 Chips. The total score is (50 + 100) * 15 = 2340. This is enough to win! Wily Joker does *not* require the hand to be a 3OAK, but simply *contain* it. Even a Full House will trigger Wily Joker.\n\nI'm looking for either the other 2 or Aces. I have 3 face-down cards. And according to this \"Mark\" blind, face-down cards are face cards. This could mean they are Queens. But since the other is 5 Jacks and 1 King, there are 8 face-down cards in the deck.\n\nTo get the best result with the current board, my play is to find the either the 3rd 2 or Aces.\nHere is the plan. I want to keep the face-down cards, since they could be Queens for Shoot the Moon. I discard the numbered cards. Specifically: I will discard the 10S (1), 8H (3), 6H (4), and 7C (7).\nFinal Decision: I will Discard positions 1, 3, 4, and 7.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,7]"}
