{"reasoning":"**The Queen's Gambit**\n\nOkay, Ante 6, Round 12. Standard Pack, which is the current game step. Inventory check: I've got a killer Joker lineup here – Juggler, Wily Joker (that sweet 3OAK chip boost), Shoot the Moon (gonna be huge with Queens, especially Holo ones), Half Joker (for those smaller hands), Card Sharp (repeat hand multiplier, always a win) and Chicot (boss disruptor with that poly multiplier). Money is tight at $17, but we'll work with it.\n\nMy strategy is clearly 3 of a Kind, leaning heavily on \"Shoot the Moon\". I need to maximize the Queen synergy. I have Death on hand so I can copy those Queens.\n\nThe pack choices are uninspiring: a six of hearts, a jack of spades (Holo), and that shiny Queen of Hearts (Glass). That Queen of Hearts (Glass) is the key. Shoot the Moon loves Queens, especially when held in the hand. The Glass card is a x2 multiplier. That's a huge multiplier and makes it far more valuable than the Jack of Spades' +10 mult, even when it is a Holo card. Even if I don't *play* the Glass Queen this round, it boosts my chances of drawing a Queen later and activating Shoot the Moon. Plus, if I *do* play it as part of my 3OAK, holding more Queens for Shoot the Moon, it's a huge mult boost. I see a clear path here.\n\nSo, I'm grabbing the Queen of Hearts (Glass). Easy decision.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
