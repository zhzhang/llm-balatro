{"reasoning":"**Ante 3/8: The Boss Battle Begins**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Round 7, the Boss Blind (The Mark), and I need 4000 chips. The Boss effect means face cards are face down, which adds a layer of complexity. My hand size is boosted by Juggler, and I've got some good Jokers in play: Wily Joker for juicy 3-of-a-Kind (3OAK) bonuses, Shoot the Moon for Queen-based multiplier mayhem (especially if Holo), Card Sharp for doubling the mult on repeats (this is key), and Scholar for Ace-powered bonuses. I also have $2.\n\nLooking at my hand: I have an Ace of Hearts, a pair of 2s, and three face-down cards. My initial strategy focuses on 3OAK for that sweet Wily Joker value or leveraging those Aces with Scholar. I have two of the rank '2' in hand, so getting a third one, a 3OAK, is my priority. The Boss Blind goal is only 4000, and I've scored higher 3OAKs before.\n\nThe deck has 45 cards left. There are 2 of the rank '2' remaining in the deck. I have two Queens left in the deck as well. The face-down cards could be Queens, I'd want to keep them.\n\nConsidering my hand, I have to make some calculated discards. I need to discard the non-synergistic cards, like the 3 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, and 9 of Diamonds, and the unknown cards (1, 5, and 8). I'm debating about discarding the face-down cards to fish for more Aces, 2s or Queens.\n\nI am calculating the card distributions in the deck. The card distribution is as follows: J: 5, Q: 2, K: 3, A: 3, others...\n\nI need to focus on drawing another Ace or another 2 for a strong play this hand. The deck has 3 Aces and 2 Twos, plus the 2 in my hand. Let's discard the 3, 6, 9. Keep the Ace and the pair of 2s. I will discard cards to get better cards.\n\nSo, let's say I go for a High Card play with the Ace:\n * Base: 15 chips, 2 mult (High Card)\n * Scholar: +20 chips, +4 mult\n * Holo (Shoot the Moon): +10 mult\nThat would be 46 chips, 16 mult, total of 736 chips, 2208 if played again with Card Sharp. Still a bit short.\n\nHowever, if I can find a 3rd '2' for a 3OAK:\n * Base: 50 chips, 5 mult\n * Wily: +100 chips\n * Holo: +10 mult\nThat's 156 chips, 15 mult, total of 2340 chips, 7020 chips if played again with Card Sharp. This is much better.\n\nI'll discard the 3, 6, and 9. Then I will discard two face-down cards, since there are 2 Queens left in the deck. It is a lower chance that it contains Queens and it is more important to find the cards that I am looking for (the third '2' or Ace).\n\nOkay, so the action is to discard 3, 6, 9, 1 and 5. Time to draw and see what the deck gives me!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6,9]"}
