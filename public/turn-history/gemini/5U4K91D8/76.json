{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis - Round 8, Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. We're at Ante 4/8 in Round 8, and it's SHOP time. The big issue? I'm broke. Zero dollars, completely tapped out. Nothing in the shop is even remotely affordable: Flash Card, Jupiter, or even a reroll. Joker slots are maxed out, and I've got nothing in the consumable slots, and obviously can't buy anything.\n\nThe only logical move here is to advance to the next round. So, the action is `round_select`. Easy. No positional arguments or extra data needed.\n\nLet's quickly run through the Jokers: Juggler gives me +1 hand size; Wily Joker is my 3OAK chip booster; Shoot the Moon adds a whopping +13 Mult per Queen in hand, and +10 Multi for Holo; Half Joker boosts my mult by +20 if I play a hand with 3 cards or less; and Card Sharp multiplies my mult by x3 if I replay a hand.\n\nActivation Order is: Wily (3OAK chips), Shoot the Moon (Holo mult), Half Joker (less than 3 cards), Shoot the Moon (Queen Mult), Card Sharp (replay mult). So, I have to ensure the proper activation and proper triggering. Wily fires when cards are scored. Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, and Card Sharp fire at different steps, so need to double-check their triggers. Half Joker and Holo Shoot the Moon are independent. The Queen Mult calculation is last, and so will trigger correctly.\n\nConsidering the Card Sharp multiplier, I really need that at the end. It's currently in position 5, which is perfect. The Holo boost from Shoot the Moon and the Half Joker bonus are additive, so their order doesn't matter too much, although I'll try to reorder them if a better joker appears in future shops. The current Joker order is optimal given the limitations.\n\nAlright, `round_select` it is.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
