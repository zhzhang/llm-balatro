{"reasoning":"**Balatro Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nAlright, here we are in the shop phase of Balatro, Ante 3, Round 6, just after the big blind. I've got a measly $2, not enough to buy anything, sadly. The shop is offering me nothing useful - no packs, no vouchers I can afford, and a reroll I can't touch. So, it's straight to the round select, which means straight into the Boss Blind.\n\nBut hold on, let me check the Joker lineup. I've got Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Scholar, and Card Sharp. I need to get this order right for optimal scoring. Wily Joker gives chips for 3OAK, Shoot the Moon gives mult for Queens (and Holo), Scholar gives chips and mult for Aces, and Card Sharp triples the mult of the previously played hand.\n\nThinking through the scoring: First, cards score; Scholar gives +20 chips and +4 mult to my Aces. Then, the played Jokers trigger, like Wily Joker's +100 chips on a 3OAK. Next, any hand-held multipliers kick in; Queens will give Shoot the Moon's +13 mult. Finally, the remaining Joker effects kick in: Holo edition gives Shoot the Moon +10 mult, and Card Sharp gives x3 mult.\n\nAha! Holo is an edition on the Joker itself. Order of operations is: played cards, then played Joker effects, then hand-held joker effects, then standalone Joker effects. Additive mults (Holo and Scholar) happen before the multiplicative Card Sharp. So, Card Sharp goes last.\n\nSo, the ideal order is: Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Scholar, Card Sharp. Position 5 for Card Sharp is perfect. The order of Wily, Shoot the Moon, and Scholar doesn't matter *too* much for the additive parts, but Card Sharp has to be at the end.\n\nWith my $2, I can't do anything here, so it's `round_select` to advance.\n\nJust to be sure, I've got $2. Standard Pack is $4. Reroll is $5. No vouchers. I'm not selling any Jokers, they're all useful for this build, with the 3OAK and Queens/Aces synergy.\n\nLet me quickly glance at the \"Last Played Hands\". My 3OAK, not using Card Sharp, was already at 5,655 chips. My pair at 3,312. A flush at 3,146.\n\nThe next Boss Blind usually requires around 10k-12k (maybe 12,000 at Ante 3?), so the second 3OAK with Card Sharp will make the score really large, maybe around 15k-16k, if not more.\n\nSo, let's keep the focus sharp, and the action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
