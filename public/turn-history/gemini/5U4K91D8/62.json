{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Joker Selection**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. I'm at Ante 4, and I need a reliable boost. My current strategy is built around Three of a Kind, with High Card and Pair as backups, leveraging Shoot the Moon for Queen synergy and Scholar for Ace-based chip/mult gain. Card Sharp is the key multiplier. I have $0, so I'm forced to evaluate the Buffoon Pack.\n\nI'm presented with two joker options: Space Joker (uncommon) and Half Joker (common). Space Joker has a 25% chance to upgrade the level of a played hand. The Half Joker grants +20 Mult if the hand has 3 or fewer cards. I currently have five jokers, meaning I *must* sell one before I can select from the pack.\n\nMy current joker lineup is: Juggler (+1 hand size), Wily Joker (+100 Chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (Holo +10 Mult, +13 per Queen), Scholar (+20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace), and Card Sharp (X3 Mult).\n\nLet's break it down: The Juggler helps with Queen draw for Shoot the Moon. The Wily Joker provides much-needed chips, especially with 3OAK. Shoot the Moon is the primary mult source. Scholar is conditional on having Aces. Card Sharp is the ultimate multiplier.\n\nI need to decide: Which joker to sell, and which joker to pick from the pack. Selling Scholar makes sense because it's the most conditional, tied to Aces, whereas Half Joker grants a flat +20 mult for my frequent 3OAKs, Pairs, and High Cards. Space Joker seems tempting for future scaling but at this stage, the immediate flat +20 mult is better to survive Ante 4 and continue my run.\n\nThe Half Joker is almost a guaranteed +60 mult (before factoring in Queens), when combined with Card Sharp. The Space Joker is more long-term value, if the RNG hits, but the Half Joker provides consistent power. Since I *have* to sell a joker anyway, I’ll sell Scholar and take the Half Joker. The goal is consistent power, not potential high-roll. Juggler is too important to give up the Queen draw, and Wily Joker is my chip generator.\n\nBefore I commit to selling Scholar, let's revisit what the schema asks for: It asks for the `action`, which must be `sell_joker`, and the `positions`, which must be [4]. Since all other schema elements are optional if null, I will follow the format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"sell_joker\",\n  \"positions\": [4]\n}\n```\n\nThe decision is to sell Scholar, which is in position 4, and replace it with Half Joker.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
