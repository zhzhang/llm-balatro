{"reasoning":"**My Discard Strategy: 3OAK Pursuit**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 8, Ante 4/8, and the Big Blind goal is 7500, with $11 to work with. I've got a decent hand: a pair of 6s (6S, 6D) along with a Queen (QH). I also have a bunch of other cards (JS, 3C, 8D, 7D, 5D, 4D). My main objective is to trigger the Wily Joker by getting a Three of a Kind (3OAK), which the Half Joker will boost with its low hand-size multiplier. I'm also hoping to leverage the Shoot the Moon Joker for those Queen multipliers. And if I can play the hand multiple times, the Card Sharp is a big win!\n\nI need to find one more 6 to complete the 3OAK. There are two 6s remaining in the deck. I need to discard the irrelevant cards and hope for that 6.\n\nI'll discard the JS, 3C, 8D, 7D, 4D. That should leave me with the 6s and the Queen, setting me up for the Wily Joker and potentially the Shoot the Moon Joker and Half Joker. That means I'm keeping the 6S, QH and 6D. And keeping the 5D for now. And I still have three discards, which I'll use to dig for that last 6.\n\nSo, the plan is to discard 1, 4, 5, 6, 8. This should give me the best chance to hit the 6 or Queens. Now I remember my prior hands, so that gives me information in case I need to change later.\n\nI need to re-evaluate the flush potential. However, the potential gains are not that great, so I will stick with the 3OAK.\n\nI will discard the JS, 3C, 8D, 7D, 5D, and 4D. This is turn 70, where I discard to find the 3rd 6 and/or more Queens. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,6,8]"}
