{"reasoning":"**My Decision: Proceed to the Next Blind**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 15. The shop phase is upon us, and unfortunately, my wallet is looking a little empty – currently at a cool $0. I've got a solid Joker lineup: Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot (Polychrome). My only consumable is \"The Lovers.\"\n\nThe shop's offerings are The Sun ($3), Gift Card ($6), and a Standard Pack ($4). But, since I'm broke, buying any of these is out of the question.\n\nI could *try* selling something, but even selling \"The Lovers\" for $1 or Juggler for $2 won't get me anywhere near affording anything useful. It looks like I just used a Spectral Pack (Ouija) last turn (147), so my cash flow is a little low.\n\nThe other actions available are `rearrange_jokers`, which is always an option, `round_select`, which is available, and `reroll_shop`, which also requires money. Since the only available option is `round_select` and since I don't have enough money to take any other action, the next logical step is to progress to the next blind.\n\nBefore I go, let's just make sure my Jokers are in a sensible order. Juggler's utility is good for early rounds, Wily Joker is there for chips, Shoot the Moon adds Multiplier (plus its Holo!), Half Joker gives multiplier, and then Card Sharp and Chicot for their xMult effects. The order is fine – Chips first, then +Mult, then xMult. I'll stick with what I have.\n\nSo, here's the final plan: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
