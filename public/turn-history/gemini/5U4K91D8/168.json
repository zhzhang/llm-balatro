{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Selection: Ante 8 Optimization**\n\nOkay, so it's the final ante, Ante 8, and the goal is to hit that 100k+ score against the boss. Right now, I've got $12 to spend in the shop. My focus is still on maximizing the Three of a Kind strategy, which is already at Level 3. I have some strong Jokers in play: Juggler (+1 hand size), Wily Joker (+100 Chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (Holo +10 Mult, +13 Mult per Queen), Half Joker (+20 Mult if hand size <= 3), Card Sharp (X3 Mult if hand type repeated), and Chicot (X1.5 Mult, Disables Boss Blind). I'm also holding The Lovers consumable. I also have some useful vouchers: Telescope, Paint Brush, Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Blank, Antimatter.\n\nMy immediate analysis screams for a Mega Celestial Pack. Why? Because the Telescope voucher guarantees that a Celestial pack will contain the Planet card, and since I've played Three of a Kind 23 times, it's a lock for Earth. The Mega pack lets me pick two cards, and getting Earth for my primary strategy is essential. That's an $8 purchase, leaving me with $4.\n\nNow, should I consider any other items? The Arcana Pack ($4) could be helpful for deck manipulation. The Blue Joker (+110 Chips) is slightly better than Wily Joker, but I'd have to sell Juggler to fit it in, which I'm hesitant to do. The Justice card (Glass card, $3) is tempting for the x2 Mult bonus, but it's a consumable and breaks, and right now I can't think of how to strategically use it. Reroll Surplus is out of the question at $10.\n\nGiven the options, buying the Mega Celestial Pack is the clear priority. Upgrading the Three of a Kind level is the best way to scale. I need to get as high a multiplier as possible to get over the target.\n\nI'm sticking with the Mega Celestial Pack.\nI'll go with `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\nThat takes the highest priority. I'll re-evaluate the Arcana pack after.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
