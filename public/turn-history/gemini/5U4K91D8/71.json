{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop - Ante 4/8, Round 8**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm in the shop, Round 8, Ante 4/8, and I've got $20. I've maxed out my Jokers at 5, and I have no consumables. Right now, my strategy is built around Three of a Kind with the Half Joker and Shoot the Moon, and it's working well. I just hit 7776 on a Big Blind that required 7500.\n\nLet's break down the Jokers I have: Juggler gives me an extra card in hand, which helps with finding 3OAK and holding Queens. Wily Joker is the core for 3OAK scoring, adding +100 Chips. Shoot the Moon is crucial; it provides +13 Mult per Queen in hand and +10 Holo Mult, which is amazing for keeping Queens. Half Joker gives me +20 Mult if my hand size is <= 3, which is perfect for my 3OAK focus. And finally, Card Sharp gives a x3 Mult if I play the same hand type twice, so I have to remember to do that.\n\nNow, let's look at the shop options. Flash Card, for $5, would give me +2 Mult per reroll, but I'd need to sell a Joker to buy it. Rerolling is currently more expensive than it is worth, and my score is doing alright for now. Jupiter levels up Flush, but I'm focusing on 3OAK, so that's not a priority right now.\n\nThe boosters: A Standard Pack is $4, which might give me more Queens or 4s/6s. But the Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6 is much more interesting! It lets me choose a planet. I desperately want *Earth* (Full House) or *Venus* (Three of a Kind, my focus) or *Mars* (Four of a Kind), but let's double check.\n\n*   Mercury: Pair\n*   Venus: Three of a Kind\n*   Earth: Full House\n*   Mars: Four of a Kind\n*   Jupiter: Flush\n*   Saturn: Straight\n*   Uranus: Two Pair\n*   Neptune: Straight Flush\n*   Pluto: High Card\n\nYes, *Venus* it is!\n\nThen there's the Tarot Merchant for $10, which gives me a permanent buff to the shop. That's a solid long-term investment.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I have $20. Jupiter is okay, but not priority. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is high priority to find Venus for 3OAK (or a backup planet). And the Tarot Merchant is a good long-term investment.\n\nIf I buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6) and the Tarot Merchant ($10), I'll have $4 left.\n\nMy current setup really relies on 3OAK, and I need to scale that. Leveling up 3OAK is the best way to do it. Is there a better Joker to help? Flash Card is good, but I need to invest in it. I'll get better luck with the Celestial Pack.\n\nOkay, I'm buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack first.\n\nMy action: `buy_booster` with position 2 (Jumbo Celestial Pack). Then buy Tarot Merchant and/or Jupiter.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
