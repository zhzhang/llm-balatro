{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy & Shop Evaluation**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 2, Round 2, with $7. My Joker setup is pretty solid: I've got Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for Three of a Kind, Shoot the Moon for Queens, Scholar for Aces, and Showman, which gives cards multiple appearances. I've also got The Sun, which converts cards to Hearts, and it is in my consumable inventory.\n\nLooking at the shop, I have a few options, but none are truly compelling. Crazy Joker is tempting for Straight builds, but it doesn't align with my current Three of a Kind/Queen/Ace strategy. The Standard Pack is alright, but I only have $7, and I need to buy it for $4, so no, and the Mega Pack is out of reach at $8. The Blank Voucher is too expensive at $10. Rerolling is also out of the question because it costs $5, leaving me with almost nothing.\n\nI'm sitting on a full Joker inventory, so I'd need to sell one to buy another, and I don't see anything worth selling. My initial thought was `round_select` to bank on the interest. With a Big Blind of 1200 and a score of 4160 last round, I'm confident I can win easily. I will get $1 for interest. The Sun isn't critical right now because my scoring is focused on Wily Joker and Shoot the Moon. I'll hold onto it for hand adjustments during the round.\n\nAfter reevaluation, it's clear: I'm better off saving money. I can revisit the shop's value next round, with a little more cash. The Standard Pack might be tempting for an Ace or Queen, but it isn't worth losing my interest. Showman could potentially deliver more value later by influencing shop contents, so selling it for $2 is not the right move. I need to keep it.\n\nSo, the plan is to move to the next round with `round_select`. There's no compelling reason to spend money now, and I'm well-positioned to win.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
