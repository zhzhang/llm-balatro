{"reasoning":"**Readying for the Next Hand**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: I'm in the SHOP phase, Ante 7/8, Round 16. I'm down to a paltry $2, which is absolutely useless in this shop. I've got a decent Joker setup for Three of a Kind: Juggler (though 6 slots are already full), Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot (Polychrome). I've also got The Lovers consumable, which is a Wild Card, ready to go. My Three of a Kind is at level 3, so I'm getting a nice base 70 chips with 7 mult.\n\nThe shop is offering Fibonacci for $8 (no way), no boosters, no vouchers, and rerolls are $5, which I can't afford. Therefore, the shop is a bust.\n\nMy Jokers are positioned pretty well for a Three of a Kind build, the only thing that could make a difference would be ordering the multiplication Jokers in a specific order, but since both Chicot and Card Sharp are multiplicative, it shouldn't matter. They should activate sequentially. The Tarot pack has already been used on some cards. \n\nBasically, there's nothing left to do here. The only thing is to proceed to the next round with my current hand. So, `round_select` it is.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
