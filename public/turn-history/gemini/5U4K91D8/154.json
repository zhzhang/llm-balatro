{"reasoning":"**Current Thinking on Deck Optimization**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante is at 7/8, $9 in the bank, and the goal is the next round. I need to get the best value from this shop. I've got a decent inventory already, including a solid suite of Jokers: Juggler (hand size), Wily Joker (3OAK chips), Shoot the Moon (Queen Mult), Half Joker (<=3 card Mult), Card Sharp (repeat X3), and Chicot (Boss disable). I also have The Lovers consumable, which is pretty useless for my 3OAK strategy, but could be sold for $1.\n\nThe shop offers Fibonacci, The Hermit, a Jumbo Celestial Pack, and an Arcana Pack. I'm prioritizing Three of a Kind, which I've been playing 20 times, and I already have Level 2.\n\nThe Hermit looks immediately appealing. It doubles my money for a $3 cost. That's a no-brainer. Fibonacci is an okay Mult source (8 mult for A, 2, 3, 5, 8). But I'm focused on Queens and 9s with my Three of a Kind strategy and Queen Multi. Fibonacci is not in those cards. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is a guaranteed Earth card (Planet card for 3OAK), and I have Telescope, so I'll get it, which will upgrade my 3OAK to Level 3. The Arcana Pack is a gamble.\n\nSo, here's the plan. First, I have to buy and use the Hermit. I have to think about this in two steps.\n\nLet's make sure the command is right.\nI'm at $9.\n\nI need to use `buy_and_use_consumable 2`. It's a consumable, and it's position 2. This has a position field.\n\nOkay, so I will select \"buy_and_use_consumable\" action and [2] for the position.\nThat will cost $3, leaving $6, and then double it to $12.\n\nAfter that, I have $12.\nI'll immediately buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6 and upgrade the 3OAK.\nThat leaves me with $6, which I'll have to figure out what to do with.\n\nI don't need The Lovers now, so I'll keep it. I can't sell it now, anyway.\n\nSo, the action is: `buy_and_use_consumable`, positions is `[2]`. Done.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_and_use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
