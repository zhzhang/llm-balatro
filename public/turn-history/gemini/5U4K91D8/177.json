{"reasoning":"**Ante 8, Small Blind Dilemma: Play or Skip?**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 8, Round 17. Zero dollars in the bank, Small Blind is 50k, Big Blind is 75k, and that Violet Vessel Boss is looming at 300k. My initial thought is to make some money. My goal is to hit 300k at the Boss, and my strategy is high-level Three of a Kind with Card Sharp (X3 Mult), Shoot the Moon (Queens), and Half Joker.\n\nDo I skip the small blind for a +3 hand size next round (Juggle Tag)? The math isn't compelling. I need money, even if it's just a few dollars, to make a decision about the shop, or at least one planet or joker card. A full hand size (+5) is good for the Queen strategy, but more important for the Boss. I need the money *now* more than I need the hand size *later*. I need the ability to buy an interesting card or a pack.\n\nI have a killer 3OAK setup. I'm leveraging Juggler, Wily (+100 Chips), Shoot the Moon (+10 Holo, +13 per Queen), Half Joker (+20 Mult if hand <= 3), Card Sharp (X3 if the hand has already played this round), and Chicot (Disables Boss effect, X1.5 Polychrome). Now, I'm thinking about the order of operations. Base Chips/Mult, card effects, then joker abilities. Mathematically, it's correct. Additive mult (Holo, Half Joker) happens before multiplicative mult (Card Sharp and Chicot). The Queen bonus and the Joker triggers are separate.\n\nThe Violet Vessel Boss is a worry, but I have Chicot, which disables the boss's effect. If this *actually* reduces it to a standard Ante 8 Boss, that 300k requirement just got a lot easier. Let's see...\n\nI am going to play. I'll need at least one good shop visit before that Boss. Plus, the money is really a necessity.\n\nI double-checked `play_round`, and I'm good. One 3OAK (Level 4, 90 Chips) should be at least 7,410 on the first play, even without Queen. Two 3OAKs will clear 50k with just the base Mult and the Half Joker bonus (about 22,230 Chips), and even more if I have a couple of Queens. Card Sharp multiplies this on the second play.\n\nMy history confirms: I can easily hit the 50k Small Blind target. It's time to play.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
