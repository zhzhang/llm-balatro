{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Joker Optimization**\n\nOkay, so the ante is at 4/8, and I've got a measly $2. The goal is clear: maximize scoring potential for the upcoming rounds. I've got a hand of jokers, and they need to be in the right order. Let's run through it: I've got Juggler, Wily Joker (which is *fantastic* for chip generation on 3-of-a-kind), Shoot the Moon (which is critical with those Queen bonuses, especially if I can make them holo), Card Sharp (a potentially insane multiplier), and Half Joker.\n\nGiven the current hand, the optimal strategy here is to leverage a three of a kind or Pair/High card to use Half Joker, Wily Joker (for 3-of-a-kind), Shoot the Moon (holding Queens), and Card Sharp (repeated hands).\n\nFirst things first, I've got $2, so nothing in the shop is accessible. No Saturn, no Zany, no Tarot Merchant, no reroll. I'm stuck with what I have. And I have to optimize these jokers. I've got to ensure they're in the right order.\n\nMy initial thought was the following order: Juggler (utility, doesn't matter), Wily, Shoot the Moon, Card Sharp, Half Joker. But hang on... Card Sharp needs to be last if the goal is to multiply *all* the other bonuses. And Shoot the Moon's +13 per Queen needs to happen, and the Holo. That triggers after played jokers, but *before* independent jokers.\n\nThe order is: 1) Boss Effects, 2) 'On played' Jokers, 3) Played cards score, 4) Held-in-hand (Steel, Baron, Shoot the Moon), 5) 'Independent' Jokers (Card Sharp, Half Joker, Juggler, Wily, Holo). The Holo effect is an edition on the Joker, so it's a step 5 thing. Half Joker and Card Sharp are basic Jokers, Step 5.\n\nSo, the key is the left-to-right activation of the independent jokers. All additive effects before all multiplicative effects!\n\nMy first crack at the optimal order was: Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Card Sharp, Half Joker. The problem? That means Half Joker triggers *after* the Card Sharp multiplier. That means the +20 from Half Joker gets multiplied, when the objective is to *add* the 20 and *then* multiply.\n\nSo, the optimal logic is Additive before Multiplicative. Current Additive: Holo, Half Joker. Current Multi: Card Sharp.\n\nSo, let's rearrange. Additive Jokers first, then X-Mult Jokers last.\n\nOkay, let's think about this. The key question is whether Card Sharp or Half Joker should come last. The answer is obvious: Half Joker needs to come before Card Sharp. Given the 'left to right' logic, the correct order will be: 1: (Juggler, Wily or Shoot), 2: (Juggler, Wily or Shoot), 3: (Juggler, Wily or Shoot), 4: Half Joker, 5: Card Sharp.\n\nSo, I need to use `rearrange_jokers` with indices `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]`. Now, am I missing anything else? I only have $2. I can't buy, sell, or reroll. The only action is to optimize the jokers. This rearrangement is the correct move for maximizing my mult.\n\nSo, before I select a round, I need to rearrange the Jokers. The current positions are as follows: Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Card Sharp, Half Joker (indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nTarget Order: Juggler(1), Wily(2), Shoot the Moon(3), Half Joker(5), Card Sharp(4). So, Shoot the Moon is the Holo, but the logic flows. Holo is part of the effect, so that triggers during Step 5.\n\nAnd to confirm: the order is 1) Boss, 2) Played Joker, 3) Played Cards, 4) Held-in-hand (Shoot the Moon), 5) Independent Jokers.\n\nThis means I need `rearrange_jokers`, positions `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]`. No, I can't be sure the rearrangement is optimal. Should I sell a Joker? No, everything seems great.\n\nLet me confirm that Half Joker is better than Zany. I can\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,5,4]"}
