{"reasoning":"**Shop Decision - Buy Strength**\n\nOkay, Ante 7/8, Round 14, almost at the finish line. Let's see... I'm in the SHOP phase. I have a rather paltry $4, and my Joker setup is looking strong: Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot. My Three of a Kind is Level 2, so it's worth playing. I also have The Lovers consumable, which means I can put an additional wild card in my hand.\n\nLooking at the shop, I have Strength (Tarot) at $3, a Walkie Talkie Joker at $4 (but I have no space for it), and a Jumbo Celestial Pack at $6 (unaffordable). A reroll costs $5 - also unaffordable.\n\nThe core strategy here is clearly 3OAK, keeping the hand small with Half Joker, and holding Queens with Shoot the Moon. Card Sharp is going to be incredibly strong because I'll be playing 3OAK multiple times to reach the score targets in later Antes.\n\nI only have $4. Buying Strength for $3 seems like the logical move. It leaves me with $1, which is still not enough for interest, so I'm not losing anything there. Also, I have a space for a consumable, so Strength will fit. I can use Strength to bump up a couple of cards, making more 3OAKs.\n\nI need to use `buy_card 1` to buy Strength, position 1 in the shop. The buy_card prompt is for cards in the shop cards section.\n\nMy current Joker order is optimal: Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, Chicot. Multipliers at the end!\n\nOkay, decision made. I'm going to `buy_card 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
