{"reasoning":"**Ready to Discard!**\n\nOkay, here's the plan. I'm at Ante 8, with the final ante and I need to hit 75,000 chips, and I have just 26,833. I've got 3 hands and 4 discards remaining. My strategy is 3 of a Kind, and right now I'm at Level 5. My Jokers are Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Half Joker, Card Sharp and Chicot.\n\nI've got a King, Jack (Wild Card), 7, Ace, 5, 3 (Bonus card, but I'm not prioritizing that right now), two Queens, and a 10. The Queens are key - Shoot the Moon gives me +13 mult for each, and they're holos so that's another +10 mult each.\n\nI've already played a 3OAK, so Card Sharp is active - that's X3 multiplier on the next one. Let's see...I need a big hand to make the 75k and win. The deck has 11 Nines. My gut says go for it.\n\nHere's the problem: This hand isn't a 3OAK right now. The Jack is a wild card. But that only does something with the suit, not the rank. I need to make a 3OAK to trigger Wily Joker (+100 chips), Card Sharp, and Half Joker (+20 mult). I need to discard the junk, and I have 5 slots and 4 discards. I need to check ranks in the deck. I can discard up to five cards in a round, and I need to find the 3OAK.\n\nI'm keeping the Queens, obviously, for the big Shoot the Moon multiplier. I should discard everything that is not a Queen or a good rank. Discard the King, 7, Ace, 5 and 10. I'm keeping the Jack just in case and because I can only discard 5 cards, to potentially help with a flush in the second discard (if needed). But 3OAK is the focus.\n\nWait! If I hit a 3OAK (say, of 9s): Base of 110 + 100 for Wily = 210, plus some chips. Then, base mult of 11, +10 Holo, +13 per Queen = 26, +20 Half Joker is 57 * 3 for Card Sharp * 1.5 for Chicot. It's a huge multiplier (71,455 chips) and it's well above the 48,167 I need to reach 75,000 and win. Easy!\n\nSo, the action is to discard. I'm discarding positions 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8. That's the King, 7, Ace, 5, and 10. Keeping the Jack and bonus 3. No, scratch that; the bonus money doesn't matter nearly as much as the hand. So the plan is discard those same cards. I'm keeping the Jack and the Queens.\n\nYes, that is the plan. Discard positions 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8. Let's do it!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,5,8]"}
