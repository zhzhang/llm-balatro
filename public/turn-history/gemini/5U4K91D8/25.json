{"reasoning":"**Strategic Round Initialization**\n\nOkay, let's take stock of this situation. I'm at the Boss Blind of Round 3, with the restriction to play only a single hand type. The goal is 1600 chips. I have a few Jokers that could synergize well. Juggler adds to hand size (good for flexibility), Wily Joker gives me +100 Chips on a Three of a Kind, Shoot the Moon grants +13 Mult per Queen in my hand (and I have the Holo edition for +10 Mult), Scholar adds Chips and Mult on Aces, and Showman just deals with duplicates. I'm also holding \"The Sun,\" but I know that's only usable once I'm *in* the round.\n\nGiven the Boss's constraint, I need to choose a hand type that can reliably hit that 1600 target. A Three of a Kind immediately looks appealing due to Wily's bonus. A Three of a Kind with an Ace for Scholar's chip and mult boost seems very strong. Even without the Ace, the base score with Wily and the mult from Shoot the Moon should be sufficient. High Card or Pair *could* work if I hit enough Queens for Shoot the Moon's mult, but sticking to one type means Three of a Kind is the safer bet.\n\nI have $3, not enough to purchase anything. There's no point in selling Jokers, and the current joker order seems fine, as it's purely additive effects. The command to start the round is `play_round`. I need to ensure that is the only command I issue.\n\nI can't use \"The Sun\" until I'm in the round, and I've already confirmed the schema for the commands available in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase. Given all this, the only viable action is `play_round`. I am targeting a Three of a Kind. That's the plan. Let's execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
