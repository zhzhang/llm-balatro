{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment for Ante 7/8, Round 17**\n\nOkay, so the boss is playing dirty, discarding two random cards each hand. I need 70,000 chips to advance, and I'm starting from zero. Four hands, four discards. Time to think this through.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup: Juggler (hand size +1), Wily (+100 chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (+13 mult per Queen), Half Joker (+20 mult if hand <=3), Card Sharp (x3 mult if repeated hand), and Chicot (Legendary - disables boss, x1.5 mult polychrome). My consumable is \"The Lovers,\" which acts as a Wild card.\n\nCurrently, my hand is: 9S, 5S, 4S, 3H (Bonus), 2H, 8C, 7C, 2C, 9D. I'm sitting on a couple of nines and twos, with the deck containing a solid number of 9s and a few Queens.\n\nMy initial thought is to make a 3OAK to activate the Jokers. The goal is to maximize the score using 3OAK to trigger Card Sharp (x3) on the second/third plays. I can see a couple of immediate options. The Lovers, if used on the 8C, can make a 3OAK of nines. But there are still plenty of 9s in the deck, so I think a discard might be better. There are 12 9s in the deck!\n\nI've got 5 cards to discard. I need to get rid of the dross: 5S, 4S, 3H, 8C, and 7C.\n\n*   Hold on. The 3H is a Bonus card for +30 chips, but I'm focusing on the 3OAK for now.\n\nSo, the plan is: discard the 5S, 4S, 3H, 8C, and 7C. That leaves me with two 9s and two 2s.\n\nThe question is, do I use the Wild card to guarantee that 3OAK of 9s immediately, or do I dig for a third 9 or, ideally, a Queen? I think digging for a third 9 *and* a Queen is a better approach, and I should save \"The Lovers\" for later if things go south.\n\nThe strategy is: 1) play a 3OAK to trigger Wily and Half Joker. 2) Play the same hand type (3OAK) again to trigger Card Sharp (x3).\n\nLet's calculate the score:\n\nWith a 3OAK, I'm looking at 70 base chips and 7 mult, and I will be using 3 cards, triggering Half Joker.\n\nSo, if I use \"The Lovers\" on the 8C:\n\n*   Base = 70 chips, 7 mult (Level 3).\n*   Wily: +100 chips.\n*   Shoot the Moon: +10 mult (Holo). No Queens in hand.\n*   Half Joker: +20 mult.\n*   Chicot: x1.5 mult.\n\nSo I am looking at a total mult of (7 + 10 + 20) * 1.5 = 55.5 and total Chips of 70 + 100 + 9 + 9 + 0 = 188.\n\nTotal = 188 * 55.5 = 10,434.\n\nWith Card Sharp, the mult would be (7 + 10 + 20) * 3 * 1.5 = 166.5.\n\nTotal = ~188 * 166.5 = 31,302.\n\nAdding them together ~41,736 which is less than what I need.\n\nI think it's better to discard to find Queens and more 9s! If I find a couple of Queens, the mult skyrockets. If I have 2 Queens:\n*   Mult = (7 + 10 + 20 + 13 + 13) * 1.5 = 94.5.\n*   With Card Sharp: 94.5 * 3 = 283.5.\n*   188 * 283.5 = 53,298.\n*   Plus the first hand (188 * 94.5 = 17,766).\n*   Total =\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,7]"}
