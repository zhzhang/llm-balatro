{"reasoning":"**Ante 7/8, Round 15: Time to Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's the Big Blind for 52,500 chips, and the next one is even tougher, the Boss Blind at 70,000.  The Boss discards cards, but Chicot is going to disable that effect, so at least that's one less thing to worry about.  I'm at $0 right now, which is a problem.  I have an Uncommon Tag, which is the option to skip the round and get a free Uncommon Joker in the next shop, but I'm full on Jokers right now and would have to sell something good to use it.\n\nMy hand consists of the following Jokers: Juggler (+1 hand size), Wily (+100 Chips), Shoot the Moon (+Mult for Queens), Half Joker (+Mult for small hands), Card Sharp (X3 if same hand), and Chicot (X1.5).  The Lovers are also available.\n\nThe plan is to play a Three of a Kind (Level 2: 50 chips, 5 mult).  Ouija was just used, so there's a good chance I have multiple cards of the same rank (I have a hand size of 9).\n\nThe choices are: play the Big Blind for $4, skip for the Uncommon Tag, or use The Lovers.  The Lovers isn't an option at this point because I don't know the hand yet. The optimal order is to play the round.\n\nMoney is the key thing, and I'm pretty desperate for it to afford the Ante 8 shops.  While a free Joker is nice, I'd have to sell a valuable Joker to use it.\n\nPlaying the round is the best choice: I need to know the rank that was Ouija'd, and I desperately need money.\n\nSo, let's do the math. 3OAK gives me 50 base chips and 5 base mult. The Wily Joker gives me +100 Chips, so that's ~150 Chips, and then another ~30 chips for played cards, for a total of ~180 chips. Then +Mult from the base 5, +10 (Shoot Holo), +20 (Half), totaling ~35 Mult.  Queens in hand add +13 per queen.  Multipliers are X1.5 (Chicot) and X3 (Card Sharp).\n\nIf I can play the same hand, I should be able to get ~51,000 for 2 hands (Big Blind is 52,500), but maybe more if I have a Queen in the hand. That's assuming Queens and card ranks will fall in my favor.  This build is capable. The past hands show I can get close.\n\nPlaying the round gives me $4 and shop access.\n\nI’m playing the round.\n\nAlright, the Joker order is: Juggler, Wily (+Chips), Shoot the Moon (+Mult), Half Joker (+Mult), Card Sharp (X3), Chicot (X1.5).  I need to make sure I understand the scoring order and how the Jokers interact.\n\nChips are first (Wily), then \"held-in-hand\" abilities (Shoot the Moon - Mult), then Independent Jokers (Card Sharp, Chicot). Shoot the Moon's +13 per queen is in Step 4. Chicot and Card Sharp are independent and are Step 5, along with Half Joker. Half Joker and Shoot the Moon's Holo are +Mult, then X3 Sharp and X1.5 Chicot. The order looks good, so I’m all set.\n\nThe action is `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
