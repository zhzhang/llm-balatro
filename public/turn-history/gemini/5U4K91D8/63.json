{"reasoning":"**Buffoon Pack Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at the Buffoon Pack. I've got room for one more Joker, currently at four. My existing Jokers are pretty solid: Juggler (hand size +1), Wily Joker (+100 Chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (+10 Mult Holo, +13 per Queen in hand), and Card Sharp (X3 Mult if hand already played this round). The pack choices are Space Joker (1 in 4 chance to upgrade hand level) - Uncommon and Half Joker (+20 Mult if hand contains 3 or fewer cards) - Common.\n\nMy current strategy is built around Three of a Kind (3 cards), Pair (2 cards), and High Card (1 card), all fitting the \"3 or fewer cards\" condition. I sold my Scholar Joker last turn to make space and now have Card Sharp in its spot (which, wait, was it always there?).\n\nGiven my hand strategy, the Half Joker is an obvious consideration. A reliable +20 Mult is a fantastic immediate boost. The Space Joker offers scaling potential, but it's RNG-dependent (25% chance of level up) and I'm at Ante 4, so I need consistency to win.\n\nThinking through it, If I play 3OAK, I get +100 chips (Wily), +20 Mult (Half), then +10 Mult (Shoot the Moon holo) + 13*n Mult (Queens), then Card Sharp X3. The Half Joker clearly synergizes.\n\nLet's double check Half Joker: \"+20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\". A Three of a Kind uses 3 cards, a Pair uses 2. It's a perfect fit.\n\nThe Space Joker's \"1 in 4 chance to upgrade level\" is tempting, but right now, I need more immediate mult. The Half Joker is worth about 6 or 7 levels of mult immediately. I'm focusing on the now.\n\nLet me think about Joker placement, though...My current order is Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Card Sharp. Half Joker is additive, and Card Sharp should be at the end for maximum effect. So maybe Half Joker at the end (pos 5), then reorder.\n\nOh, right, I should just select the card first.\n\nI will take Half Joker (position 2 in pack).\n\n...But is Space Joker a real possibility? It's scaling is nice, but I'm on Ante 4, so immediate Mult is better than potential scaling.\nHalf Joker + Card Sharp = +60 Mult (if played twice). That's huge.\n\nJuggler helps keep Queens in hand, Wily Joker needs 3OAK, Half Joker needs 3 cards or less...3OAK is exactly 3. Perfect.\n\nAlright, I will select card number 2 from the pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
