{"reasoning":"**Current Game State and Decision Making**\n\nOkay, so this is the final Ante, Round 18, and I'm in the SHOP phase. I have $4, and my strategy is locked into a Level 5 Three of a Kind build. My Joker lineup is pretty strong: Juggler gives me the hand size boost, Wily Joker adds chips to my 3OAK, Shoot the Moon is a beast with its Queen-focused multiplier, Half Joker gives me some flat mult, Card Sharp is the X3 multiplier for repeated hands, and Chicot (Legendary) is there for the X1.5 multiplier and boss blind disable. I've got all six Joker slots filled and no consumables right now.\n\nLooking at the shop, there's a Foil Runner, but it's not a match for this build and is too expensive anyway. The Lovers tarot card at $3 is interesting – a Wild card is *always* useful – but I'm primarily focused on getting specific rank cards in this build. I'm offered a Standard Pack for $4. I have no money, which is very unfortunate.\n\nWith just these final rounds ahead, improving the deck consistency is the top priority. The standard pack offers a choice of cards to add to the deck, and my goal is the 9s for the 3 of a Kind, and Queens for the Shoot the Moon Joker. With so few rounds left, a Standard Pack is better than the uncertainty of the Lovers card. I will buy the Standard Pack and make the best of it.\n\nI'm definitely going to buy the Standard Pack with my current $4. This will leave me at $0. I'll stick with the Joker order I have; it's optimal for this setup, with the additive multipliers ahead of the multiplicative ones. Specifically, I'll keep the Shoot the Moon (Holo) and Half Joker additive boosts at the front, with the multiplicative Card Sharp and Chicot at the end. Chicot being at the very end is exactly where it needs to be.\n\nI'm purchasing the Standard Pack with the `buy_booster 1` command, and I'm ready to move forward.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
