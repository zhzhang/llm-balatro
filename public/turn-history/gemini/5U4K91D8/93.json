{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: Blind Select - Big Blind**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Round 10, the Big Blind. I'm staring at 16,500 chips needed, with a paltry $2 in my pocket and a potential $4 reward. But I have the \"Garbage Tag\" voucher, and that's the kicker here. It's currently worth $21.\n\nI've got a solid Joker setup: Juggler (hand size +1), Wily Joker (+100 Chips), Shoot the Moon (+13 Mult per Queen), Half Joker (+20 Mult if 3 or fewer cards), and Card Sharp (X3 Mult). Antimatter is now in the mix, too. I'm hitting max Jokers, so I'm building strong. I also have some useful Vouchers.\n\nThe upcoming Boss is \"The Head,\" and they debuff all Hearts. That's a potential wrinkle, since my core strategy is built around Three of a Kind. However, since the debuff doesn't affect the hand type, my core strategy is still valid. But shoot the moon is in trouble, it seems.\n\nIf I play this Big Blind, I'll get a shop visit, and maybe $4. But I have $2. I won't be able to buy anything anyway!\n\nSkipping gives me the instant $21 from the Garbage Tag, bringing me to $23. That's a massive injection of capital, which will let me buy something in the next shop... if I make it there. The only downside is I skip a shop and get a direct Boss Blind select.\n\nHere's the math on playing:\n\nMy base 3OAK is 30 chips with 3 Mult, but with my Jokers, I can expect the following:\n\nHand 1: ~160 Chips * 33 Mult = ~5,280 score\n\nHand 2: ~160 Chips * 99 Mult = ~15,840 score\n\nCombined: ~21,120 which is enough to win.\n\nBut if I get even one debuffed Queen, that could be a huge score, which will push me to victory with a second 3OAK play.\n\nThe Head, with its debuffed Hearts, is a factor. Debuffed cards still count for hand type (thankfully!). The Shoot the Moon is the main worry because Queens are my bread and butter. However, based on the calculation, I should be safe.\n\nSo, the play is clear: I'm skipping this Blind to trigger the Garbage Tag, get that sweet $21, and head straight to the Boss. My bankroll can actually be useful with the next shop visit.\n\nOkay, let's re-confirm that the plan is right. Boss needs 22,000. I can hit that: with a single Queen, I'll hit 22,080 easily.\n\nNo shop visits by skipping the Big Blind, but that is fine. I'll take it.\n\n*   `skip_round`.\n*   My money increases: $2 -> $23.\n*   Next event: The Boss, The Head.\n*   I can beat that, with the Queens in hand.\n*   `action`: `skip_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
