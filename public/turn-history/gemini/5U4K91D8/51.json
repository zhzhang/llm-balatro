{"reasoning":"**Analysis for Boss Blind: The Mark**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at the \"Boss\" blind, \"The Mark,\" where all face cards are dealt face down. My ante is 3, this is round 6, and I need 4,000 chips. I've got a couple of important Jokers: \"Shoot the Moon\" (Queens = +13 Mult, Holo = +10 Mult), and \"Wily Joker\" (3OAK = +100 Chips). I also have \"Scholar\" (+20 Chips, +4 Mult for Aces) and \"Card Sharp\" (X3 Mult if hand played twice this round). \"Juggler\" (+1 hand size) rounds out the crew. My cash is tight at $2, and I have a Director's Cut voucher for a blind reroll, but can't afford it.\n\nThe primary strategy here is going to be to find Queens in the face-down cards to trigger \"Shoot the Moon\" and aiming for Three of a Kind to trigger \"Wily Joker\" early. I should be able to play Aces to trigger \"Scholar\". The face-down mechanic adds a layer of difficulty, so I will have to rely on discards. I need to make sure I play the same hand twice to utilize \"Card Sharp\" for the 3x Multiplier at the end.\n\nNow, let's optimize this joker setup. Given that I can't reroll, my current joker order seems fine:\n1.  Juggler\n2.  Wily Joker (+Chips)\n3.  Shoot the Moon (+Mult)\n4.  Scholar (+Chips/Mult)\n5.  Card Sharp (X3)\n\n\"Card Sharp\" *must* be last, since it multiplies the final multi. \"Wily Joker\" should come before \"Shoot the Moon\" because chips are applied before mult, which should come before \"Scholar\". This keeps my strategy simple.\n\nAll I need to do is hit \"play_round\".\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
