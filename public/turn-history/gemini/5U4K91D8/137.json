{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis: Prioritizing 3OAK Power**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my current thought process. I'm in Ante 7, Round 14, with $10 in the bank. My immediate goal is to maximize the potential of my Three of a Kind (3OAK) hand, currently Level 1. I've already invested in the Telescope voucher, meaning any Celestial Pack I buy will guarantee me the \"Earth\" card, which levels up 3OAK.\n\nI have a few options in the shop: a Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6, the Strength card for $3, and Walkie Talkie for $4. Considering my current Joker setup (which is strong but doesn't have any specific 3OAK synergy) and the fact that 3OAK is my most-played and preferred hand, leveling up 3OAK is the top priority. The Walkie Talkie's benefits are tempting (+10 chips, +4 mult for 10s and 4s played), but I believe that scaling 3OAK level with the Celestial Pack will provide the most significant immediate boost.\n\nMy initial thought was to consider buying Strength, which helps shape the deck for 3OAK. However, the order doesn't matter since I can still afford both cards. I can buy the pack for $6 first, and Strength for $3, leaving me with $1. Buying the pack is the more direct path to power.\n\nSo, the plan is to buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack first (position 1). The next step is to open the pack and select the Earth card, which will upgrade my 3OAK hand. I should then consider buying Strength after since my budget allows me to buy Strength.\n\nIn sum, it looks like a `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
