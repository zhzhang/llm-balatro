{"reasoning":"**Early Game Strategy: Maximizing Value with Tarot Cards**\n\nOkay, so the game's just started. We're at Ante 1/8, Round 0. I got a Mega Arcana Pack skip reward, and it gave me the TAROT_PACK phase. I've got Juggler as my starting Joker, which is fantastic! Extra hand size is always a win early on, helps with filtering and holding potentially strong cards, like the Steel card. I have $4, no consumables yet.\n\nMy pack choices are *Justice* (risky, but strong multiplier), *The World* (bad for the current boss, \"The Goad\", who is Spades-debuffed), *The Chariot* (a solid Steel card for consistent X1.5 multiplier), and *The Emperor* (two random Tarot cards).\n\n*The Emperor* seems like the obvious choice here. It provides the most immediate value, since I have no other consumables currently, and two open slots. More consumables translate to more chances for strong effects like money (Hermit/Temperance), or enhancements. Even more Jokers are possible with Judgment. Therefore, I will **select 4** and go for it.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
