{"reasoning":"**The Optimization of a Poker Hand**\n\nOkay, so the Ante is 4/8, and this is Round 9 against \"The Arm\" boss – that's going to lower the level of my played hand, which is annoying. The target is 10,000 chips. Currently at zero, yikes. I have 4 hands remaining and 2 discards to get there.\n\nThe Jokers I'm working with are pretty good: Juggler (increases my hand size - that's passive), Wily Joker (gives me 100 chips for a 3-of-a-kind - that's the key!), Shoot the Moon (Holo +10 mult, and +13 mult for each Queen in hand - excellent!), Half Joker (+20 mult if I play 3 or fewer cards - also strong), and Card Sharp (X3 mult if I replay the same hand in the round - that's going to be essential).\n\nI see I have a Level 3 3-of-a-kind (70 chips, 7 mult) and Level 1 pairs (10 chips, 2 mult).\n\nMy current hand is: Q♠, 9♠, K♥, 9♥, 2♥, K♣, Q♣ (Gold Card), 3♣, 5♦. I have pairs of 9s, Kings, and Queens. The plan is clear: I *need* a 3-of-a-kind, preferably to trigger Wily Joker first and then to prime Card Sharp for a big payout in the next play.\n\nThe Boss's effect will reduce the 3OAK by one level when played, so from Level 3 down to Level 2. I have to play the first 3OAK to activate the multiplier with the Card Sharp. The strategy is to get a 3OAK, play it to activate Card Sharp, and then immediately aim for another 3OAK for that sweet X3 mult.\n\nSo, I have two Kings, two 9s, and two Queens. I have to discard non-pair cards to hunt for the third card for each of those hands. It's obvious: I discard the 2♥, 3♣, and 5♦. I can also confirm that I should keep both Queens for a total of +26 mult with Shoot the Moon. But if I make a three of a kind for the Kings, I can keep the Queens for the bonus, which is what I should do.\n\nSo, discard 5, 8, and 9.\n\nWait, I have another discard, so, do I need anything else? I see, I have Queens, 9s, Kings: the numbers are 2, 2, and 3 (Queens, 9s and Kings) in the deck, so I am maximizing my chances. Let's make sure. The best plan is to keep all pairs for the best chance of a 3OAK.\n\nOkay, let's review:\n1. Juggler (Passive)\n2. Wily Joker (+100 chips for 3OAK)\n3. Shoot the Moon (+10 mult, +13 per Queen held)\n4. Half Joker (+20 Mult if playing 3 or fewer cards)\n5. Card Sharp (X3 Mult)\n\nThe order of operations is: Wily Joker, base mult, then Holo, Half Joker, held-in-hand bonuses, and then the X3 of Card Sharp.\n\nOkay, the discards are definitely correct. Action: `discard`, positions: `[5, 8, 9]`. Double-checking to make absolutely sure: `discard 5 8 9`\n\nAction: `discard`, Positions: `[5, 8, 9]`\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,8,9]"}
