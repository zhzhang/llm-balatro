{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization: Three of a Kind Build**\n\nOkay, let's see. Ante 4, Round 8, Shop Phase. $14 in the bank. The plan is still firmly rooted in Three of a Kind (3OAK) with these jokers: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for chips on 3OAK, Shoot the Moon for Queen multiplication, Half Joker for 3 card hands, and Card Sharp for hand type multiplication. My hand is Level 3 for 3OAK (70 chips, 7 mult).\n\nScanning the shop: the Flash Card is a no-go for now. Jupiter is useless. Standard Pack is tempting for deck thinning. Tarot Merchant is a long-term play for more Tarot cards and deck manipulation which I like. Reroll is too risky at $5 right now.\n\nMy initial thought was to buy the Tarot Merchant first, leaving me with $4, then grabbing the Standard Pack. Interest is good, but improving the shop is better in Ante 4. However, the order doesn't actually matter! I could do Standard Pack first.\n\nBut, given the immediate impact, and how important Tarot cards are, I'll stick to my initial plan. Tarot Merchant, $10, leaves $4. Then the Standard Pack, another $4, leaving me at $0. Perfect. That's a good deck/shop investment.\n\nAction: `buy_voucher 1` (Tarot Merchant).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
