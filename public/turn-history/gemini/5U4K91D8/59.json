{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Evaluation for Ante 4**\n\nAlright, I've just finished Ante 3 Boss, and I'm looking to optimize my setup for the next round. Currently, I'm sitting on $8 with a decent Joker build: Juggler (hand size), Wily Joker (3OAK chips), Shoot the Moon (Queen/Holo mult), Scholar (Ace chips/mult), and Card Sharp (repeat hand mult). My focus right now is to improve my scoring potential for Ante 4.\n\nI'm considering my shop options. Saturn is tempting to level up Straights, but it's not a priority since I haven't really been using that strategy. Zany Joker offers +12 mult for 3OAK, which is tempting but I have to sell a Joker. I have to think, is +12 mult better than +1 hand size? Wily is +100 and Shoot the Moon is +10 mult on 3OAK. Buffoon Pack could be strong, or it could be a dud if I don't get something good. Tarot cards can provide enhancements, so the Arcana Pack is a good starting point. I've got $8.\n\nMy immediate thought is to check the Arcana or Buffoon packs. Tarots offer long-term scaling with Steel for my Shoot the Moon strategy or even deck manipulation. The Buffoon Pack is a risk, but it could replace Juggler.\n\nI'm leaning towards the Arcana Pack first. A good Tarot could give me an immediate boost. I quickly re-evaluated Zany Joker, and I think it may be worth it to replace Juggler. But let's see what the Arcana pack offers.\n\nI've got $8, which means I can buy the Arcana Pack first, see what I get, and still have money left over. This is the optimal route. The Buffoon Pack is high-risk, high-reward, but I need to see what's on the table.\n\nNow, let's look at the best course of action. I can also consider buying and immediately using Saturn, but Straights are not my focus. I have a 3OAK setup with Wily Joker and Shoot the Moon, and Card Sharp for repeated hands. I need to make the best use of my money.\n\nSo, I will buy the Arcana Pack. This is the strategic play to maximize my options. It is the best move to open up options for Ante 4. And I can buy the Buffoon Pack immediately after.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate action to take is to buy the Arcana pack.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
