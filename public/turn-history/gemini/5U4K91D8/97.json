{"reasoning":"**My Play for This Round**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 5/8, Round 11, facing \"The Head\" boss blind. I need 22,000 chips, and I've only got 6,900, so I'm 15,100 short. With only 3 hands and discards left, I'm under pressure. Let's see... the boss blind means all Hearts are debuffed. I need to make some strategic plays here.\n\nI've got the following jokers in my hand: Juggler (hand size +1), Wily Joker (+100 for 3 of a Kind), Shoot the Moon (Holo +10 mult, +13 mult per Queen), and Half Joker (+20 if hand has 3 or fewer cards), and Card Sharp (X3 Mult if poker hand already played this round). The key is the Card Sharp. In the previous turn, I played a Three of a Kind (10s), which means any subsequent 3 of a Kind will get tripled in mult.\n\nSo, here's my hand right now. 3 of Spades, Queen of Hearts (debuffed), 8 of Hearts (debuffed), 6 of Hearts (debuffed), Queen of Clubs (Gold Card, worth $3 if held), 7 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, 8 of Diamonds, 2 of Diamonds.\n\nMy immediate thought is to create a Three of a Kind to trigger Card Sharp again. I've got a pair of 8s (8H, 8D) and a pair of 6s (6H, 6C) and a pair of Queens (QH, QC). So I need one more card to have a 3 of a Kind. The Queen of Clubs also has a potential +13 Mult (for Shoot the Moon, and it's a Gold card worth $3. The debuffed cards won't give me any extra chips, and the heart cards are debuffed anyway.\n\nWith 3 discards, I need to focus on drawing those cards. Let's see...I need to optimize my discards. I need to find the 3rd card for the 3OAK.\n\nI will discard: 3 of Spades, Queen of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds and focus on making either a 3 of a Kind with either 8s, 6s or Queens.\n\nI am holding onto: 8H (debuffed, but can contribute to 3OAK), 8D, and QC (a Gold Card that can get the $3 and the extra +13 Multi). This will give me a base mult, a potential +10 for the Holo +20 for Half Joker and the Shoot the Moon +13. This will put my total chips over the top. So...\n\nLet's quickly calculate the expected value. If I make a 3OAK: 30 base, +100 from Wily Joker, scoring cards (6, 8, or queen), a +10 for Holo (Shoot the Moon), +20 for half joker, and X3 from Card Sharp. The Queen of Clubs gives me the +13 mult for Shoot the Moon. I will be far over my threshold.\n\nSo, let's discard those cards. Wait. Let me just refine those discards. Since 8H, 6C, and QC all can contribute to a good hand, maybe I should discard the debuffed cards and a junk card instead. That makes more sense.\n\nLooking at the new hand: Now I've got 8H (debuffed), QC, 6C and 8D. I discard 3 Spades, Queen of Hearts, 6 Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds, this keeps pairs intact. I have 8 outs for a Three of a Kind from the deck. The probability is decent of hitting it. Let's hit the button and see what we get!\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,6,9]"}
