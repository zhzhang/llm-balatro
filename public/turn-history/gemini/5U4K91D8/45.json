{"reasoning":"**The Shop Dilemma: Card Sharp or Director's Cut?**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase after snagging that Big Blind, with a cool $20 in my pocket. Let's see...I've got a decent Joker setup: Juggler for the extra hand size, Wily Joker fueling my 3 of a Kind strategy, Shoot the Moon adding some serious Queen/Holo punch, Scholar making Aces even more lucrative, and Showman just hanging around as a duplicate.\n\nThe real prize in the shop is `Card Sharp`, that juicy X3 multiplier. However, I need to open a Joker slot to buy it, but I currently have all five Joker slots filled. The previous reasoning was that I should sell Showman since it is the least impactful. Selling Showman will get me $2, and Card Sharp costs $6, I have to sell Showman to get the more expensive Card Sharp.\n\nNow the question is, *is* Card Sharp the best move? It is strong for the Boss Blind. If I can win in one hand, Card Sharp won't have any impact. But against a Boss, having a backup or a way to scale if the first hand isn't enough is good.\n\nLet's see the rest of the options...Hmm, two Standard Packs and a Director's Cut voucher. Standard Packs could give me more Aces or Queens to synergize with my existing Jokers. Director's Cut lets me reroll that looming Boss Blind, which is *huge*.\n\nA quick calculation: If I sell Showman, I have $22. I could buy Card Sharp ($6), leaving $16. Then, I could buy the Director's Cut ($10), leaving $6. Finally, a Standard Pack ($4) leaves me with a measly $2, but I can use that to play. That sequence feels like a solid play.\n\nWait, is there any better move? Let's go step by step and work our way through all the possibilities.\n\n**Action: sell_joker 5 (Showman).**\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
