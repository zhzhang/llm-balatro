{"reasoning":"**Finalizing the Mega Celestial Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 8, Round 17.  Three of a Kind strategy is the *only* strategy.  I've got the ideal jokers: Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot. My Three of a Kind is Level 4 with 90 Chips and 9 Mult. I just need to decide which booster card to pick.\n\nThe choices: Jupiter (Flush), Uranus (Two Pair), Mercury (Pair), and Neptune (Straight Flush). Venus is already selected. I need to select one of these. \n\nA Three of a Kind deck *contains* a pair. If I can't get the third card, I'll play a pair. So Mercury (Pair) is the most relevant. Two Pair is irrelevant.  Flush and Straight Flush are useless here. \n\nI'm definitely choosing *something*.  No point in skipping. Mercury it is. I have $4, so after this, I can buy that Arcana pack and look for cards like Deaths/Strengths/Hierophants that might help.\n\nMercury's position is definitely 3.\n\nI'm going to double check everything again: The intended hand type will be null since it doesn't apply to selecting a booster card, and also the estimated chips will be null.\n\nFinal thought: Mercury (Pair) is the most likely fallback strategy. Jupiter and Neptune are useless for this deck since they require 4 and 5 cards, respectively. Two Pair requires 4 cards and I have Half Joker which encourages 3 cards max.\n\nSo, I'm going to make the selection. Let's do this:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [3]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
