{"reasoning":"**Current Run Strategy: Ante 6 Optimization**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 6, round 11 – interesting that the boss round is here. Time to optimize the build. We've got $38, and a Three of a Kind focus (Level 1, which is key). Current jokers are Juggler with Antimatter, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Half Joker, and Card Sharp, leaving one slot open. Vouchers include Director's Cut, Antimatter (good for the extra joker slot), Blank, and Tarot Merchant.\n\nThe immediate need is to scale up. We need to boost that Three of a Kind output. Paint Brush ($10) is a must-buy to increase hand size. It'll help find the 3OAK and let me hold onto Queens for Shoot the Moon. Then the Celestial Pack ($4) will level the 3 of a kind. Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6) could offer deck manipulation or more money, but the deck's been solid so far. The Flower Pot is tempting for its X3 mult but conflicting with Half Joker. I'm sticking with Half Joker for now, as 3-card hands are easier to get.\n\nThe first step is to buy the Paint Brush. Then, I'll grab the Celestial Pack to level up Three of a Kind. The Jumbo Arcana Pack is a good third buy for tarot cards. I am considering a reroll.\n\nOkay, let's execute the purchase. The command is `buy_voucher 1`. I've got $38 currently, and the Paint Brush costs $10, Celestial $4, and Jumbo $6. That's a total of $20 spent, leaving me with $18 – safely above the $15 interest threshold.\n\nThe prompt specified valid JSON output. So action is \"buy_voucher,\" positions [1] (Paint Brush). Let's double-check the shop... Shop Vouchers: 1: Name: Paint Brush.\n\nRe-verifying: Shop Cards, Shop Boosters, Shop Vouchers. Position 1 for the Paint Brush is correct.\n\nBuying the voucher first is the most logical step to improve the run long-term. Although, leveling up the primary hand is very high priority. But I have enough money for both.\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_voucher\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
