{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Decision: The Mark Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: \"The Mark\" blind, meaning all face cards are dealt face down. My goal is 4000 chips, and I'm currently at 2376. I have three hands left and only one discard. I've got a decent Joker setup: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for Three of a Kind bonus, Shoot the Moon for potential Queen bonuses, Scholar for Ace bonuses, and Card Sharp for a multiplier if I replay a hand type this round.\n\nMy current hand has some potential. I have a Pair of 2s, and I'm thinking I can trigger either a Three of a Kind or a Pair with an Ace to get me to my goal. Since I just played a Pair, Card Sharp's x3 multiplier is active. A Pair of 2s with one Ace will get me 2064 points, which would win. But I need to draw these cards.\n\nThe four face-down cards are the key here. The face cards are the Jack (5), Queen (2), and King (2). Total = 9 face cards in the deck. I've got four face-down in my hand. With only 1 discard left, I need to make this count.\n\nSo, here's the plan: Since I only have one discard, I'm going to discard the least useful cards in the hope of drawing a key Ace or the third 2. Those least useful cards are the 6S, 5S, and 8D. I know the face-down cards are Jacks, Queens, or Kings, so no Aces or 2s there.\n\nI'm checking my history, because I played a Pair previously. The math indicates that a Three of a Kind with the Wily Joker will win, or a Pair with an Ace and Card Sharp.\n\nNow, let's confirm the discard: I *will* discard 1, 2, and 9 to maximize the chance of drawing the critical cards. Since I have only one discard, there's no way to discard more. My goal is for the next draw to include a 2 or Ace.\n\nOkay, confirmed. Let's make this happen. I'm going to discard 6S, 5S, and 8D. This is the optimal strategy. Let's see if this pays off.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,9]"}
