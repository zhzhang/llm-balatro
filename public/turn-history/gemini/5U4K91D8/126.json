{"reasoning":"**The Planet Pack Puzzle**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in round 13, Planet Pack phase after buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack. I've got $15 left. My primary strategy is Three of a Kind (3OAK), which is currently at Level 1. I'm rocking some decent Jokers: Juggler, Wily Joker (that's +100 Chips on 3OAK!), Shoot the Moon (good for Queens), Half Joker (+20 Mult for 3 or fewer cards), Card Sharp (x3 Mult on repeated hands), and Chicot (boss disable + x1.5 Mult).\n\nMy available Planets are Neptune (Straight Flush), Jupiter (Flush), Pluto (High Card), Mercury (Pair), and Saturn (Straight). The goal is to level up my Three of a Kind.\n\nEarth, the 3OAK Planet, isn't present, which is annoying. I need to make a strategic decision for a backup plan. I've got a decent number of Hearts (12) and Spades/Clubs (8), but I'm not prioritizing Flushes or Straights. Looking at hand levels, I've played Three of a Kind 14 times, Pairs only 3 times, Flushes once, and Straights never.\n\nSince Earth is out, I've got to choose a useful hand to fall back on, and the Half Joker gives me an incentive to stay small!\n\nI need to make the right choice between a Flush, a Straight, or a Pair. Mercury (Pair) gives me +1 Mult, +15 Chips. Jupiter (Flush) gives +2 Mult, +15 Chips, while Saturn (Straight) gives +3 Mult, +30 Chips. Since I'm often discarding to find those 3OAK cards, Pairs are the most likely fallback. The Flush and Straight provide more points if I'm desperate, but they both negate the Half Joker!\n\nThe Half Joker really makes me want to make a small hand. I see that the Neptune (Straight Flush) is very rare, Pluto (High Card) is least valuable.\n\nSo, Mercury seems the most logical, a perfect backup for my `Half Joker` build.\n\nLet's do this: I select Mercury (Pair).\n\nOkay, let me double-check the levels and values. Flush is now Level 2, Straight is Level 1, Pair is Level 1. So, if I take Mercury, Pair becomes Level 2. Jupiter will make Flush become Level 3, and Saturn will make Straight level 2.\n\nValues: Pair Level 1 is 10x2. Flush is 50x6. Straight is 30x4.\nIf I take Mercury (Pair Level 2) it will be 25x3.\nIf I take Jupiter (Flush Level 3) it will be 65x8.\n\nFlush is a stronger base, but with the Wily Joker, my build is *all-in* on 3OAK. In the event I don't get 3OAK, I'm probably losing anyway. Pluto (High Card) triggers Half Joker too, but Pair (Mercury) is objectively better than High Card.\n\nI will take Mercury. It's the right move for this game plan.\n\nAction: `select` position `4`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
