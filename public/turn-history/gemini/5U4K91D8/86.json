{"reasoning":"**Small Blind Decision Time**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 5/8, Round 9. I'm sitting on $6, but this is about to change. My inventory's looking decent, with a focus on Three of a Kind (3OAK), which, unfortunately, took a hit from \"The Arm\" and is now Level 1 (30 chips, 3 Mult). My Jokers are Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Half Joker, and Card Sharp. I also have some Vouchers: Director's Cut, Blank, and Tarot Merchant, but the one I really want is in the shop.\n\nThe Small Blind is up, 11,000 chips for $3. There's also an Orbital Tag for skipping that upgrades a hand by 3 levels (randomly, which I'm not thrilled about), or the Big Blind at 16,500 for $4, with a Garbage Tag for skipping. \"The Head\" (Hearts debuffed) is looming, so I want to build a hand to combat this. The Antimatter voucher (+1 Joker Slot) is in the Shop for $10, which is exactly what I need.\n\nMy build hinges on 3OAK, which, even at Level 1, can be powerful. I can easily clear the blind if I use 2 hands with Card Sharp. The Small Blind seems crucial to get me to the shop. The Orbital Tag is tempting, but the Antimatter voucher is a game-changer for the late game. I'd rather buy the Antimatter voucher.\n\nIf I play the Small Blind, I get $3, plus $1 interest, and potentially another $2 from the hands, which means I can get the voucher! I'll have around $12.\n\nIf I skip the Small Blind, I get the Orbital Tag, but no shop, and no guarantee to get enough money for the voucher.\n\nYes, the 6th Joker slot is the best move. I'm going to play the Small Blind.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
