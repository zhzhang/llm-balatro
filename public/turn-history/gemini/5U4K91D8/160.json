{"reasoning":"**Boss Blind Battle Plan**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, round 16. I'm choosing to go head-to-head with the Boss Blind, which is the correct play. This Boss has 70,000 chips and discards two random cards each hand. However, I have Chicot – thank goodness – that completely negates the discard effect. This is *crucial*. The strategy is a Level 3 Three of a Kind (3OAK), so I need to make the most of it.\n\nI've got a solid Joker setup: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for chips on 3OAK, Shoot the Moon for mult (Holo + Queens), Half Joker (big mult if hand is small), Card Sharp for the X3, and, of course, the ever-important Chicot (Polychrome, X1.5 mult and boss disable). I even had The Lovers consumable, to enhance wild cards - but I need to make a play to use this, so it may as well get sold for funds. I currently have $2, not ideal, so I need to win this round to gain more for the shop.\n\nThe current game plan:\n\n1.  **Play the round.** It's the only logical action right now.\n2.  I can't use \"The Lovers\" yet - no cards in hand, so sell it.\n3.  Joker order is optimized: Juggler first (for hand size and utility), Wily Joker for the chips. Shoot the Moon, and Half Joker are additive. Card Sharp (X3) and Chicot (X1.5) are multiplicative and in a good order relative to each other; their exact placement doesn't matter (multiplicative property).\n\nThe final action here is to `play_round`. My reasoning is simple: I'm well-prepared. Chicot negates the Boss, and my Joker setup is strong for a 3OAK run. We go!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
