{"reasoning":"**My Optimization Plan: Ante 6, Round 12**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 6, Round 12. My primary goal is to maximize my score in this and future rounds, especially given the upcoming Big Blind. My strategy is centered around a Three of a Kind with Queens, leveraging the \"Shoot the Moon\" Joker.\n\nCurrently, I have $17. My Joker slots are completely filled with: Juggler (hand size), Wily Joker (3OAK chips), Shoot the Moon (+Mult per Queen), Half Joker (hand size <=3), Card Sharp (X3 Mult), and Chicot (disable Blind). My consumable slots are also full with Death and The Lovers.\n\nLooking at the shop, there's a Standard Pack for $4. I just picked up a Glass Queen of Hearts, which is great for the build. My current hand optimization strategy revolves around this Queen and the \"Shoot the Moon\" joker I am using.\n\nI'm evaluating my options:\n\n*   **Option 1: Buy the remaining Standard Pack for $4.** This would leave me with $13, still netting me $2 interest in the next round. The main advantage is the potential to get another Queen, which would be ideal, or perhaps a useful card with a seal or enhancement that I could duplicate with Death. The downside is the inherent randomness of Standard Packs, so it could be a bust.\n\n*   **Option 2: Reroll the shop for $5.** This is a gamble. Rerolling could bring up a Planet card like Mars, perfect for my 3OAK. However, I have no open slots, so I'd have to sell or use a consumable to take it. The Lovers is worth $1, and Death is also $1, so that feels like a waste. Plus, there is no guarantee I'll find something worth the reroll.\n\n*   **Option 3: Proceed to Round Select.** This is the safe play. It maximizes interest income next round, potentially giving me more money for a better buy later. However, it's less proactive.\n\nMy build is very specific right now: 3OAK combined with held Queens. Death is my failsafe to duplicate a key card, and The Lovers acts as a wildcard to complete a hand. I can't improve Jokers, but I can upgrade my hand with a Standard Pack.\n\nConsidering everything, buying the Standard Pack is the most proactive move. I have to spend money somewhere, and there's a higher chance of obtaining a card that improves the deck. I am optimizing here for the short term with a focus on potential value for the next Ante. I will buy the Standard Pack.\n\n*Action:* `buy_booster 1`\n\nLet me double-check my inventory one last time. Jokers are still: Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot. Consumables are Death and The Lovers. The shop still has the Standard Pack, and I have $17. All is consistent.\n\n*Action:* `buy_booster 1` (Standard Pack)\n\nSo, Ante 6, Round 12. Strategy: Three of a Kind with Queens. My Jokers are tailored for that, and I'm buying this Standard Pack with the hope of strengthening the deck with Queens or valuable enhancements.\n\n*Self-Correction:* Actually, wait. Should I reroll? The cost is $5, and if I find a Planet like Mars, I can't buy it without selling a consumable. Lovers are worth $1. Death is worth $1. It's still better to look for cards first.\n\n*Final Plan:* Buy the Standard Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
