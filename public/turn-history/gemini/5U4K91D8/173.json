{"reasoning":"**Strategic Endgame Decision: Arcana Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 8, Round 17 – the endgame. My goal is simple: absolutely *max out* the score for this final stretch. The strategy's locked in: Three of a Kind, specifically leveled to 4. I've got a killer Joker lineup: Juggler, Wily Joker (that 3OAK chip boost!), Shoot the Moon (love those Queen multipliers), Half Joker (with a 3 card limit, need to keep that in mind), Card Sharp (repeat hand multiplier!), and Chicot (boss negation and polychrome buff). No consumables currently, but I just burned \"The Lovers\" on a Jack earlier.\n\nI'm staring down these Arcana Pack choices: The Magician (Lucky Cards), The Tower (Stone Card), and The High Priestess (Random Planets). My hand is, let's see... Jack (Wild), Ace, 9, 7, Ace, 7, 4, Ace, 2. Three Aces.\n\nThe \"Half Joker\" is a critical consideration. High Priestess is looking prime since it'll fill those empty consumable slots. Those Planets can seriously swing things, either directly benefiting the 3OAK, or by giving me good fallback options if RNG hates me. \"Telescope\" increases the odds of Venus, and even a planet for High Card or Pair would be a massive help. The Magician could be great, but is too RNG-dependent with those lucky cards. The Tower's totally out, the stone card is a complete non-starter for this build.\n\nSo, High Priestess is the clear front-runner. I'm going with option 3. I am generating 2 planet cards in the consumable inventory. I just need to select.\n\nHold up... *double-checks* the command format... Okay, *select* followed by the pack card position. And The High Priestess doesn't require card targets.\n\nAlright, think I've got this. The entire goal is to optimize for the next round and beyond, using planets.\n*Action: select*\n*Positions: [3]*\nReady to go!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
