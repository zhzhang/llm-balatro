{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment for Ante 8: Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's the final ante, Ante 8, Round 18, and we're in the shop phase. Zero dollars in the bank, unfortunately. The objective is to conquer the Big Blind and the Boss Blind. We're running a Three of a Kind strategy, and based on the hand levels, that's where the focus should be.\n\nThe joker configuration looks pretty solid. Let's recap:\n\n1.  *Juggler*: Increasing hand size is always good.\n2.  *Wily Joker*: That hefty +100 chips is always useful.\n3.  *Shoot the Moon*: This Holo version is particularly enticing; the +10 mult and held card triggers should really help.\n4.  *Half Joker*: Another additive multi, +20, with hand size restrictions (exactly what we want to avoid), but with an optimized strategy this is really powerful.\n5.  *Card Sharp*: The x3 multiplier is strong.\n6.  *Chicot*: Disabling Boss Blind effects is essential, and the x1.5 multiplier is the icing on the cake.\n\nWe can't buy anything from the shop because the money is at zero.\n\nThe Joker order is something that I always want to make sure of. The ordering is correct: additive multipliers (Shoot the Moon, Half Joker) need to come *before* multiplicative multipliers (Card Sharp, Chicot) for maximum effectiveness. We don't want to get our multipliers mixed up.\n\nI've got the following actions to consider:\n\n*   No consumables.\n*   No consumables to sell.\n*   The current joker order is good.\n*   No need to sell jokers. They're all strong contributors.\n*   Can't buy cards or boosters.\n*   Can't buy vouchers.\n*   Can't buy and use consumables.\n*   \"round\\_select\" is the only valid move.\n*   Rerolling the shop is impossible.\n\nInitially, I had just skipped ahead, but it's important to be thorough. Can I sell anything to buy \"The Lovers\"? Nope. Selling \"Chicot\" is the only thing that would get us the money we need. While this would normally be an idea to consider, the hand strategy is Three of a Kind; \"The Lovers\", while tempting, does not fit my strategy. My jokers are doing a better job providing the scoring needed.\n\nSo, the optimal course of action is, and remains, to advance to the next round. The shop has nothing for us.\n\nTherefore, the action is \"round\\_select\".\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
