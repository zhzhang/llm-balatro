{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Ante 3 Opening**\n\nOkay, so we're starting Ante 3 with $15, and my Jokers are pretty solid: Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Scholar, and Showman. My immediate goal is to scale up to beat the Ante. My deck is mostly level 1 hands except for the Flush which I just used and it scored pretty well.\n\nLet's look at the shop: Neptune, Jupiter, Arcana Pack, Standard Pack, and Director's Cut. I have a Flush at level 1 right now. Buying and using Jupiter to level it up is a no-brainer for $3, immediately boosting my strongest hand type. It's a quick, guaranteed, and cheap improvement. I can afford it with my current money.\n\nI could buy an Arcana pack for $4 for deck manipulation (Aces and Queens) or a Standard pack. However, given my current hand, Jupiter is the right call for quick power. I could also roll the shop, but that feels wasteful at this stage.\n\nMy thinking is: `buy_and_use_consumable` to buy Jupiter, which is at position 2 in the shop. I'll still have some money left for an Arcana Pack later.\n\nI need to confirm all the constraints: valid, parseable JSON, no comments, double quoted strings, single JSON object if just one request.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_and_use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\nOkay, the above JSON should be perfect. I've double checked the shop card positions, the command syntax, the money constraints, and the strategic value of Jupiter. There is no other obvious immediate play. Jupiter is a direct upgrade for my immediate needs, and I can always buy the Arcana Pack later to improve my long term deck.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
