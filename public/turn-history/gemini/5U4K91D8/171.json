{"reasoning":"**Ante 8 Shop Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Shop phase, and the goal is to maximize my score for these final blinds. I'm running a Three of a Kind strategy, which I've got at Level 4, so I'm looking at 90 chips and 9 mult as a base.\n\nI have a solid Joker setup already: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for chips, Shoot the Moon (Holo) for a chunk of base mult and Queen scaling, Half Joker for more flat mult, Card Sharp for a multiplier, and Chicot for another multiplier, plus boss disable. All six slots are full, so no space for new jokers. I also have \"The Lovers\" consumable, which doesn't affect the shop.\n\nLooking at the shop, I have $4 to spend. Justice, a Glass card upgrade, is tempting at $3. It's strong to double the mult on a core card, but since I can't target cards in hand right now, it is not useful at the moment, and I'd need an empty consumable slot (1/2 is filled, which I could use to purchase it). I could buy and use Justice, but there's no way to use it immediately, since I can't target cards.\n\nThe other option is the Arcana Pack for $4, which gives me a choice of Tarot cards. That could be *huge* for deck fixing; Strength to get more of the same rank for my 3OAK, Death to copy a Queen or a high card, or even some extra mult.\n\nI've already optimized the Joker order as: Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot. The additive mult (+Mult) Jokers are before the multiplicative mult (X Mult) Jokers, and Shoot the Moon's Holo bonus works left-to-right. This is ideal, as the order affects the scoring calculations!\n\nI have $4, and the Arcana Pack costs $4. Given that it's Ante 8, I want the most impactful consumable. An Arcana pack choice is usually better than a single Justice card. This is a no-brainer: it's Arcana Pack time. Let's do this. I'm selecting the Arcana Pack, position 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
