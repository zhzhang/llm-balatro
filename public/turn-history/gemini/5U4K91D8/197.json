{"reasoning":"**Round 20 Strategy: All-In on 3OAK**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Boss Blind, 300,000 chips needed, and only four hands left. I'm running with a Three of a Kind strategy at Level 6, which gives me a base of 130 chips and a 13x multiplier. I've got a killer set of Jokers: Juggler, Wily Joker (extra chips for 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (that juicy Queen multiplier), Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot (boss blind cancel).\n\nLooking at my hand, I've got a Jack, 8, King, 7, 4, a Queen (thankfully!), an Ace, a 9, and a 5. No immediate 3OAK, but the deck is showing a whopping 13 Nines, and I *really* want to make use of those Queens, for the Shoot the Moon Joker. With all that in mind, the play is obvious: discard cards to find those 9s or another card to build a 3OAK.\n\nRight, so I keep the Queen and the 9. The rest are history. That's Jack, 8, King, 7, 4 out. Now, let's see what the discards bring. This move is solid; it directly supports my 3OAK strategy and prioritizes card values in the deck. I'm building for a high-value hand, making sure the JSON is properly formatted, and ensuring my next move is strategic.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"discard\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
