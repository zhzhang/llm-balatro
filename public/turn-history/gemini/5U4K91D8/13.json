{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Decision Making**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 2, Round 1. I've got $4 to work with. The shop's offerings are pretty sparse: Arrowhead is $7, Blank Voucher is $10, and Reroll is $5. Clearly, I can't afford anything at the moment. I've got a decent Joker setup with Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (which is Holo, good), and Scholar. I also have The Sun consumable.\n\nMy first thought is that The Sun is too valuable to waste now. It's best deployed when I need to make specific card transformations for a specific hand type, like creating a Flush by targeting cards in hand. I have a gut feeling that this will be useful down the line, but not right now.\n\nGiven my financial constraints, selling is out of the question since I have space, and the Jokers I have are all pretty decent, providing additive bonuses. No need to clear space. I'll mentally note the Joker order; Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Scholar. The order does not impact the final score since I don't have any X mult, which is the only thing that would depend on the order of Jokers.\n\nThen I paused. Could I possibly use The Sun *in* the shop? The command description for `use_consumable` does specify that I need to specify cards in \"hand\". But, in the SHOP phase, there's no visible \"hand\". Thinking about Balatro's mechanics, I remember that you can't use consumables that affect cards in the shop (unless they're packs). Thus, I must move on. The action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
