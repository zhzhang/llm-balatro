{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop Before the Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2, Round 3, and the Boss Blind is next. I've got a measly $3, which isn't going to get me much. The shop is offering a Wrathful Joker, a Business Card, and a Standard Pack, but I can't afford any of them, nor can I afford a reroll. My Joker slots are full, with Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Scholar, and Showman all equipped. I also have The Sun consumable, but I don't see a reason to burn it right now.\n\nNo point in rearranging the Jokers. With the mult being additive, it doesn't really matter the order. I could sell a Joker, but I don't *want* to sell any of them. Each is useful: Juggler gives hand size, Wily boosts chips, Shoot the Moon is potent mult, Scholar adds mult and chips and Showman offers the chance for duplicates. I'm not going to sell two of those to buy a pack.\n\nMy best move is to just get to the next round, so the shop phase is over.\n\nThe coming Boss Blind requires 3,200 points. I scored 3,366 on my last hand with a Two Pair, which is a good baseline. I *should* have enough to score above the blind.\n\nSo, the next step in my thought process is to move to round selection, which is \"round\\_select\". I'm not targeting any specific hands or positions right now. My next action is to select a round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
