{"reasoning":"**Discard Strategy for a Target 3OAK**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 13 with the Big Blind, targeting 30,000 chips. Let's see...I've got a decent hand, but I need to make some strategic choices to hit that target. My Jokers are a nice mix: Juggler for the hand size, Wily Joker for the 3OAK bonus, Shoot the Moon for Queen synergy, Half Joker for hand size, Card Sharp for repeat plays, and Chicot. Death and The Lovers are my consumables.\n\nThe current hand's ranks show a Queen, two Jacks, and some other singletons. No immediate 3OAK, so I've got to find some more cards. The ideal scenario involves building a 3OAK (likely Jacks for now, since I have two) while also holding onto those Queens for the \"Shoot the Moon\" bonus.\n\nI have 4 discards, so I've got to use them wisely. With the discard, the goal is to maximize the probability of getting more Jacks (for 3OAK) and Queens (for \"Shoot the Moon\").\n\nAfter a quick calculation, if I can pull off a three-of-a-kind (in the current scenario, three Jacks) and hold a Queen, I can hit a very high score thanks to the Wily Joker and other multipliers. Specifically, the \"Half Joker\" joker is best if the hand size is <= 3 cards. If I get the hand right, I can hit about 33,000. That's assuming I can get the third card.\n\nSo, the plan is to discard the cards that aren't critical: Ace, King, 10, 6, 2, 9, 7.\n\nI could also think about using Death to convert cards. But with the discards remaining, I'll go with the high-probability discard strategy.\n\nI have decided to discard 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. That's five cards. I am keeping the Queen, both Jacks, and the Ace and King in case I need to switch to high card or a pair. Then, on the next turn, if needed, I'll discard the Ace and King.\n\nSo, I'll `discard` the cards in positions \\[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The intended hand type is a `three of a kind`.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,9,10]"}
