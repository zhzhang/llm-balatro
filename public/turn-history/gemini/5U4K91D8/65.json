{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nAlright, let's see. Ante 4, Round 7. I'm in the shop with a measly $2. The shop offers are decent, Saturn to level up Straight, Zany Joker for 3OAK multi, and a Tarot Merchant. The reroll is way out of reach at $5. No dice. I can't buy anything, and I can't reroll.\n\nMy Joker setup is: Juggler (utility, always useful), Wily Joker (chips for 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (big potential with Queens and the Holo), Half Joker (flat multi), and Card Sharp (multiplicative). The current arrangement is perfect. Additive effects first, *then* the multiplicative one. Shoot the Moon is in the optimal spot to use its effects. Since I have no consumables or vouchers to use, I'll advance to the next round.\n\nGiven that I'm entering Ante 4, where things get significantly harder, I need a reliable strategy. I'm thinking of aiming for 3OAKs or Pairs. Crucially, I have to play the *same* hand again to trigger Card Sharp's X3 multi. The Juggler gives me +1 hand size which means I'll have 9 cards to work with, making those hands far easier to assemble and hold those Queens.\n\nOkay, let's head to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
