{"reasoning":"**Final Ante, Shop Phase: Zero Dollars, Maximum Synergies**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. This is it, the final ante. Round 17, and I'm staring down the barrel of the last blind. The shop phase is here, but I'm completely broke – $0 to my name. Looks like I used up everything I had going.\n\nMy hand is full, though, with all six Joker slots occupied. I have a solid crew: Juggler (utility), Wily Joker for chips on 3 of a Kind, the Holo Shoot the Moon for a mult boost and Queen bonuses, Half Joker which helps if the hand is smaller, Card Sharp for x3 mult on repeat, and Chicot for an X1.5 multiplier. Not bad, not bad at all. They synergize well with a 3OAK strategy, so there's no reason to adjust the order: Chips/Add Mult first, then X Mults.\n\nI’m currently running a Three of a Kind strategy and there's no need to rearrange. I can't buy anything in the shop anyway: no Justice, no Blue Joker, and definitely no reroll surplus. All consumables have been used.\n\nLooks like the only option is to move on to the Blind Select screen. No money, no purchases, just execution. It’s go time.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
