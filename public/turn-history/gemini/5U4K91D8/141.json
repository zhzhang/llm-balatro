{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 7/8, Round 14, and I'm facing the Blind Select phase. The current blind is the Small Blind, worth 35,000 chips. I have a Boss Tag, but with Director's Cut and Chicot, the Boss Blind's effect is negated and I can reroll the Blind anyway, so it's not super valuable. I'm sitting on a meager $1, but I need to make money for the shop, and potential rerolls.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty killer for Three of a Kind (3OAK), which is my focus. I have Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (holo), Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot (poly). I also have The Lovers and Strength consumables, but those aren't relevant for this phase. My vouchers include Telescope, Paint Brush, Director's Cut, Tarot Merchant, Blank, and Antimatter. My hand is currently at Three of a Kind Level 2 (50 Chips, 5 Mult).\n\nSince playing the Small Blind gives me $3 plus round leftovers and the opportunity to shop, it's a no-brainer to play. Skipping it for a Boss Tag is a bad move.\n\nMy Joker order is already optimized: Juggler (chips), Wily Joker (chips), Shoot the Moon (mult), Half Joker (mult), Card Sharp (xMult), and Chicot (xMult). No need to rearrange.\n\nLet's calculate the potential: Wily gives me 100 chips, so my base is 150 chips (plus the face values of my cards) + Juggler. Shoot the Moon (holo) adds 10 mult, and Half Joker adds 20. My total mult is currently 35 (plus 13 mult per Queen in hand). Card Sharp will triple the mult if I play it after a 3OAK. Chicot gives 1.5x mult.\n\nMy estimated chips are (150 + ~30 from cards) * 35 * 1.5 ≈ 9,450 for the first 3OAK (assuming no Queens) and (150 + ~30 from cards) * 35 * 3 * 1.5 ≈ 28,350 for the second 3OAK. With a Queen in hand, or higher cards, I can definitely hit that 35,000 target in two or three hands.\n\nSo, I'm going to play the round. My plan is 3OAK.\n\nI will formulate my plan for the JSON.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"three of a kind\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 35000\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
