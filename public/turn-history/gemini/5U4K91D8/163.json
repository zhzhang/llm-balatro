{"reasoning":"**Ante 7: The Endgame**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 7, staring down The Arm boss. Chicot's doing his thing, so no card discards, thank goodness. My target is a hefty 70,000 chips. I'm currently sitting on 17,025. That means I need to rake in about 53,000 more in the next three hands. No pressure, right?\n\nMy Jokers are: Juggler (hand size buff), Wily Joker (3OAK boost), Shoot the Moon (Queen mult), Half Joker (3-card hand mult), Card Sharp (hand repetition mult), and Chicot (boss negation and polychrome mult). I also have a Lovers consumable.\n\nThe last hand, I nailed a Three of a Kind with a score of 17,025, which activated Card Sharp for the next play. Now, I have a decent hand: a couple of Kings, a pair of 9s, another 2 and a Queen.\n\nThe ideal play is a 3-card Three of a Kind to trigger that juicy Half Joker.  I've got the Lovers card, but that only turns a card wild which doesn't help create a 3OAK. I just need to draw a third of a rank!\n\nThe math is pretty clear. I estimate that I can score around 42,750 if I have a 3-card 3OAK and a Queen. That's not enough! If I draw another Queen, that would be much better.  I need to get another Queen or a 3OAK card, hopefully the 9s. I see I can discard two cards. The plan is to discard any non-Kings, non-9s or non-Queens. There are 9 Nines in the deck - that's my target.\n\nThe action is to *discard* the Jack, the 6, and the two 2's, along with the King. Let's get that draw and finish this.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,5,8]"}
