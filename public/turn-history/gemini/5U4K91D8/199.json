{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy for Victory**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 8/8, Boss Blind is staring me down at 300,000 chips. I'm currently sitting at a paltry 26,599 with only three hands left and three discards to work with. My objective is crystal clear: rack up an additional 273,401 chips to move to the next level.\n\nI have a killer combination of Jokers in play: Juggler (more hand size), Wily Joker (more chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (big Queen multiplier, and Holo mult), Half Joker (big mult with smaller hands), Card Sharp (X3 on repeat poker hands), and Chicot (boss disabled and Polychrome mult). My hand is: 9♠, 9♠, A♥, Q♣ (Gold), J♣, 8♣, A♦, Q♦, 5♦.\n\nMy initial thought is a Three of a Kind (3OAK), which is my most reliable path to maximizing chips, since I only have three hands left. Card Sharp will triple my multipliers if I play the hand after playing a hand. I can use the two nines I have, but, there are many more in the deck. I could also rely on the Queens I have for Shoot the Moon. I need to be strategic.\n\nI'm holding the Q♣ and Q♦ for Shoot the Moon's big multiplier. I see a high potential in using these Queens to build my score. I will likely only have one shot at building a score with each of these queens. The Queens are a good base to aim for, or, find one more Nine, which has a higher chance of being played this round.\n\nSo, I'm thinking I'll discard [3, 5, 6, 7, 9], that is, the Ace of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, and 5 of Diamonds. This gives me maximum chances of drawing another 9 or another card that will build my hand. This means I'm keeping the 9♠, 9♠, Q♣, and Q♦ for now.\n\nLet's assume the best-case scenario. If I hit a 3OAK, I'm looking at roughly ~80k chips per hand. With my current setup, I can earn roughly 80k on the remaining three hands, which would bring me to 260,000 total chips. \n\nSo, I still need more chips. I need to get as much mult as I can out of those remaining hands. The three discards will be crucial in ensuring that I hit on the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,5,6,7,9]"}
