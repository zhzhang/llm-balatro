{"reasoning":"**My Decision: Play the Blind**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 4, Round 7, BLIND_SELECT phase. I've got $11 and the Big Blind is 7500 chips. The \"Economy Tag\" skip doubles my money, but only to $22. Playing the blind gets me around $19 (reward, interest, and hand-based money) plus the shop. The real kicker is the Boss Blind, \"The Arm\", which *lowers* my played hand level. That's a real threat since I've already leveled up some of my hands, and I need to play the *same* hand again to benefit from Card Sharp.\n\nMy Jokers are pretty solid: Juggler (for hand size), Wily Joker (chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (Holo mult and Queen mult), Half Joker (mult if hand size <=3), and Card Sharp (x3 mult if played twice).\n\nI calculate that if I hit a 3OAK (Level 2) and have a Queen, I should be sitting at (50 base + 100 Wily + ~20 card chips) * (5 base + 10 Holo + 20 Half Joker + ~13 Queen) = 170 * 48 = 8,160. That easily clears the 7,500.\n\nSo, the choice is $22 by skipping or ~$19 *and* the shop by playing. The $3 difference is trivial. The shop is *critical*. It's a chance to find a planet, find a Tarot, or upgrade a Joker, which is more important than the immediate cash. I have a full Joker lineup already, so it's a good place to be. Also, playing allows me to potentially generate more money or find a specific card in the shop before the Boss.\n\nThe Boss Blind \"The Arm\" is bad news. Skipping and going straight to that fight, without a chance to strengthen my hand, is a gamble. Therefore, the optimal play here is to…\n\n`play_round`\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
