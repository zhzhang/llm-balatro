{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Ante 2, Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: We're at Ante 2, heading into the boss round. My primary focus is deck improvement for consistency. Currently have $9, and my Joker setup is solid: Juggler (hand size), Wily (chips on 3 of a Kind), Shoot the Moon (Holo mult and Queen mult), Scholar (chip/Ace mult), and Showman (duplication). The hand levels are balanced. The \"Boss Blind\" could be anything right now, so I need to prepare for whatever comes.\n\nIn the shop, the obvious play is to buy something. There's Wrathful Joker ($5), but the suits don't matter enough right now. Business Card ($4) is decent for economy, but I have no space. My best bet is to improve the deck. I'm choosing between a Jumbo Standard Pack ($6) and a Standard Pack ($4). I have to pick one. The Jumbo pack gives more cards, which is what I need. I'm really hunting for Aces, Queens, or Jacks to synergize with Scholar and Shoot the Moon.\n\nI need to decide between Jumbo Standard Pack ($6) and $0 interest vs. $9 (no pack) and $1 interest. The $3 left over is a much smaller consideration than the potential for a key card for my mult. The value of a card from a Jumbo pack is *generally* higher than the $1 interest in Ante 2. The *action* is to buy the jumbo pack. \n\nI'm checking if there is any reason to sell/rearrange. I have to make sure to order my Jokers correctly, but it's all additive mult at the moment. Order doesn't matter (Scholar is +4 on score, Shoot the Moon is +13 held, and +10 holo is independent/edition).\n\nJuggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Scholar, Showman - additive.\n\nI reconfirm the purchase: Buy the Jumbo Standard Pack. I've got $9, it costs $6. The command is `buy_booster 1`.\n\nIs there a better move? Save $1 on interest? Not worth it. Reroll the shop? Costs $5, and the odds of getting something better aren't worth the risk. A guaranteed deck improvement is better.\n\nI have The Sun consumable but it is not useful to me right now.\n\nFinal decision: I'm buying the Jumbo Standard Pack.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
