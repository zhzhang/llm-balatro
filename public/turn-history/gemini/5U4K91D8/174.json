{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Current State & Actions**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Final Ante, Round 17, SHOP phase. The goal is clear: reach that chip threshold for the final blinds. My primary strategy is still the Three of a Kind (3OAK) build, which is at level 4 with 23 plays. I have a solid joker lineup: Juggler for hand size, Wily Joker for chips on 3OAK, Shoot the Moon (Holo, +10 Mult, and Queen bonuses), Half Joker (+20 Mult if hand size <=3), Card Sharp (X3 Mult), and Chicot (Boss Blind Disable, Polychrome x1.5 Mult).\n\nI've got zero dollars in the bank, and the shop isn't an option. I just used the High Priestess, and that gave me Uranus (Two Pair) and Jupiter (Flush) in the consumable slots.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate the most optimal path forward. Given I have no money and can't shop or reroll, my choices are to use/sell consumables or proceed to round selection. Since the shop is out of reach, there is no reason to hoard these consumable planets, despite having $0. The potential benefits of leveling up Two Pair and Flush outweigh the minor value they'd have as sale fodder.\n\nLet's break it down: Uranus levels up Two Pair, and Jupiter levels up Flush. While 3OAK is my main focus, those hand levels provide strategic flexibility and act as a safety net in case I'm dealt poor cards. There is no reason to postpone using these, and I don't have any cards that benefit from holding onto them, such as a \"constellation\" joker.\n\nThe optimal action is clearly to use these consumables immediately. Since I am instructed to provide the \"next\" action, I will do this one at a time. The first action to perform is to `use_consumable 1` to use the Uranus card.\n\nBefore I commit to that action, I should quickly check if there is an optimal arrangement for my jokers.\nMy jokers currently are: Juggler (Utility), Wily (+100 Chips), Shoot the Moon (+10 Mult), Half Joker (+20 Mult), Card Sharp (X3), Chicot (X1.5). The multipliers are applied in series and are equivalent when the two X jokers are swapped. Additive jokers are performed first. This order is already ideal.\n\nThe answer is to use Uranus.\n\n**Action: `use_consumable 1`**\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
