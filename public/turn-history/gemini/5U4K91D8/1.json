{"reasoning":"**My Mega Arcana Pack Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the very start of this run, Ante 1, no Jokers, $4, and facing a choice of five powerful Arcana cards. This is a Mega Pack, which means I get to pick two. The goal is to survive to at least 450 chips for the Big Blind, or ideally to 600 for the Boss. I need to make some smart choices here to get a good start.\n\nLooking at the options, Justice (Glass), The World (Spades), Judgement (Joker), The Chariot (Steel), and The Emperor (2 Tarots).\n\n*   **Justice** is tempting for its scoring potential, but the break chance early on makes it less appealing right now. I don't want to get penalized this early.\n*   **The World** is automatically out. The Boss debuffs Spades, so that's a *hard* no.\n*   **Judgement** gives me a random Joker, which is huge! I have zero Jokers, and the immediate impact of a Joker is likely what I need to make sure I get that 450 chip target.\n*   **The Chariot** is a good, safe long-term choice for its Steel bonus, but I need immediate power.\n*   **The Emperor** gives me two random Tarot cards, which *could* be great, maybe even *another* Judgement! This does feel a little like a gamble.\n\nSo, I need to pick two. I'm going to start with **Judgement**. The goal is immediate power, and getting a Joker now is vital.\n\nThe order doesn't matter too much, but I'll go with Judgement first to make sure I get a Joker.\n\nThen, after getting my Joker I can pick the second card. My first selection is definitely Judgement.\n\nNow I am going to select `Judgement`. My first selection: `select 3`. Then I will be looking to see what is available for the second pick. I am very likely going to be selecting `The Emperor` for the second selection.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [3]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
