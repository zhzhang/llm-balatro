{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante: To Skip or Not to Skip?**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 4/8, Round 7. My current balance is a measly $2, and the Small Blind is 5,000 chips. I have a decent Joker setup: Juggler (hand size +1), Wily Joker (+100 chips on 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (+10 Mult Holo, +13 per Queen), Half Joker (+20 Mult if 3 or fewer cards), and Card Sharp (X3 Mult if hand already played). My goal is 5,000 chips, and I'm leaning toward 3-of-a-Kind or Pairs for my hand strategy.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. I've got this \"Handy Tag\" skip reward that gives me $1 for each of my played hands this run, which is 9. That's a solid $9 right there! If I skip, I go straight to $11. Playing would give me around $7 after winning the small blind (reward + interest + remaining hands). The shop after playing would be good to get a Planet or Tarot card.\n\nHmm, this is a tricky one. With my jokers, I can get well over 5,000 chips in one hand. Wily Joker, Half Joker, and Holo plus a level 2 3OAK is more than enough. If I play and win in two hands, I'll have about $7 in the shop, but if I skip, I'll have $11. I'm thinking I'd skip Small ($11) and then play Big ($11 -> $17) and go to the shop with more funds.\n\nThe Big Blind is 7,500 chips, and the boss is 10,000. It's The Arm (lowers hand level), which is not the best with Card Sharp. The \"Economy Tag\" on the Big Blind doubles my money, up to $40. Skipping the Small Blind could give me more money to spend in the long run. The initial shop visit after the Small Blind gave me Saturn and Zany, but I couldn't afford them ($2). If I skip Small ($9), play Big, and then shop with ~$15, that shop is worth more.\n\nOn the one hand, I could play to build up Card Sharp usage and potentially get more money from hands. But wait, I'm almost broke! That $9 from the skip is looking mighty attractive right now. I have all Joker slots filled, so I don't *need* a shop immediately. I think I'll skip, because $9 is a very solid boost at this stage. I want to be able to make some bigger purchases in one go.\n\nI *really* want to see that shop, but I'm going to skip. $9 is a *guaranteed* profit, and I think I can handle the next blinds. I checked the metadata again. I have 5 Jokers and all slots are full. I don't immediately need a shop, I can play big and skip the Small Blind. I will skip, get the $9, and be better positioned for the shop after the Big Blind. Let's do this. I've calculated that I can beat the Small Blind in one hand, even, but with the $9 in hand I'll be much better positioned for the rest of this ante.\n\nYes, skipping is the best play.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
