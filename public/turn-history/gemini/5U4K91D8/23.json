{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, so we're in Ante 2, Round 3, and I've got $3 to spend. The current game step is a Jumbo Standard Pack, which is good. Let's see what we've got to work with. My Jokers are Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Scholar, and Showman. Nice mix, although I'm looking for synergies here. Shoot the Moon is the big multiplier, Scholar is decent for chips and mult on Aces, Wily Joker wants 3 of a Kind, and Showman increases variety. Juggler means I can hold more cards, which is obviously always good.\n\nThe pack options are the 9, 10, and Jack of Clubs, a 3 of Clubs with a bonus, and a Stone Card. Neither an Ace nor a Queen is immediately available for Scholar or Shoot the Moon synergy. The Jack is a face card, which is nice, but not ideal right now.\n\nNow, the 3 of Clubs (Bonus) is intriguing. It gives +30 chips *and* crucially, generates $3 every time I play it and score. Considering my low funds, this is the smart move. The Stone Card is a flat +50 chips, but doesn't help me with economy or Joker triggers. The 3 of Clubs is a direct boost to my economy, especially early on. It's a no-brainer.\n\nSo, I'm going to *select* the 3 of Clubs (Bonus) at position 4. It's a standard pack, so my intended hand type is null and there's no way to estimate chips gained right now, it is a shop action. This seems the best move to stabilize my economy going forward.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
