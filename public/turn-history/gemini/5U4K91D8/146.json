{"reasoning":"**The Spectral Pack Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 7, the SPECTRAL_PACK phase, and my goal is to reach Ante 8. My strategy hinges on \"Three of a Kind\" (3OAK), and I've got a decent Joker setup: Juggler (hand size +1), Wily Joker (+100 Chips for 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (+13 Mult per Queen in hand, +10 Mult Holo), Half Joker (+20 Mult for <= 3 cards played), Card Sharp (X3 Mult for repeated hands), and Chicot (Boss effect disable, X1.5 Mult Polychrome).\n\nCurrently, my hand size is 10 (8 base + Juggler + Paint Brush). Now, let's look at these Spectral choices:\n\n1.  **Trance:** Add Blue Seal to a card – potential for Planet scaling, but maybe a bit slow for this late in the game.\n2.  **Grim:** 2 Enhanced Aces – decent for score, but less deck manipulation.\n3.  **Ouija:** Converts all cards in my hand to a single random rank, but reduces hand size by 1.\n4.  **Sigil:** Converts all cards in my hand to a single random suit – useless for 3OAK.\n\nThe clear winner here is **Ouija**. Getting a guaranteed 5-of-a-kind (or better) is absolutely crucial. Sure, it drops my hand size to 9 (8+1 from Juggler and Paint Brush), but that's manageable. I just need to make sure I don't lose Shoot the Moon's queen multiplier if Ouija gives me a different card. Regardless, the consistency of Ouija will make future hands trivial to play and scale.\n\nSo, Ouija, it is! Let me just double-check the command. It's `select` with no hand card targets. I want to select pack position 3 (Ouija). I think I'm ready to make the play. I'm hitting `select 3`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
