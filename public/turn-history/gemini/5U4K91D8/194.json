{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` state after grabbing that Celestial Pack. My focus, as always, is on optimizing this run, and with the Telescope voucher locked in, I know Venus is available. This is a Three of a Kind run, so it's a no-brainer. I need to level up my hands, and Venus offers the best option.\n\nLooking at the inventory, I have a strong set of Jokers: Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot (Polychrome). The key here is the existing Three of a Kind at Level 5. The Venus card will give me +2 Mult and +20 Chips, which is the exact stat I need to level the hand. Mercury isn't relevant for the hand in this circumstance, and though Uranus is OK, it is less important.\n\nTherefore, the obvious play is to select Venus. The command to do that is `select 1`. Let's get this done!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
