{"reasoning":"**Decision Time in the Blind**\n\nAlright, let's get down to business. Ante 6, Round 12. Small Blind, 20,000 chips needed. Time to evaluate the hand. I've got a decent spread, with a few Jokers to consider. We have Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon, Half Joker, Card Sharp, and Chicot available.\n\nLooking at the hand, the three 10s (positions 5, 7, 9) immediately catch my eye. A Three of a Kind with those would activate Wily Joker for 100 chips, and Half Joker for 20 Mult (because the hand size is <=3). And, we also have the bonus of the Holo bonus on Shoot the Moon. Chicot is also available for the Polychrome multiplier.\n\nNo Queens in hand currently, so that part of \"Shoot the Moon\" won't kick in, but the Holo bonus is nice. My immediate thought is, a Level 1 3OAK is 30 chips and 3 mult. This hand will be higher due to the Jokers.\n\nSo, let's calculate the score: the base is 30, the 10s add 30 more, and Wily provides 100, which gives us 160 chips. The base mult is 3, + 10 Holo, + 20 Half Joker = 33 mult. Then multiply by Chicot, we have a total mult of 49.5 (33 * 1.5). 160 * 49.5 = 7920.\n\nNow, we need 20,000, so 7920 is a good start, but clearly not enough. Luckily, I have 4 discards and 4 hands remaining. If I play this Three of a Kind *now* and again *later*, Card Sharp will kick in (x3 multiplier). Playing the same hand again should get a similar score, so let's run the numbers: 160 chips, same 33 mult (before multiplier). 33 * 1.5 * 3 = 148.5 mult (thanks to Card Sharp and Chicot) and this hand will be 160 * 148.5 = 23760 chips. Combined with the first hand, that's 31680. Perfect - we clear the blind.\n\nSo, 3OAK on the 10s is the play. Let me just confirm: positions 5 (10 of Hearts), 7 (10 of Clubs), 9 (10 of Diamonds) are the three 10s.\n\nShould I play the Aces instead? (Positions 1, 4). There are 2 Aces left in the deck. Not a huge difference in chips gained by playing Aces.\n\nGiven the remaining discards and hands, this is a very safe play to \"prime\" the next hand. No reason to rearrange cards, Half Joker incentivizes a small hand size.\n\nOne last check. Shoot the Moon for a potential +13 mult *each* Queen (but +10 for the Holo is guaranteed), Half Joker, Wily, and Chicot. 33 * 1.5 = 49.5 mult. 160 * 49.5 = 7920.\n\nLet's look at the metadata for previous 3OAKs... Ah yes, the lower scores are without Card Sharp, the higher ones with. My estimate of 7920 is consistent with that history.\n\nFinal decision: **play** the three 10s.\n\nThe JSON is constructed: `{\"action\": \"play\", \"positions\": [5, 7, 9], \"intended_hand_type\": \"three of a kind\", \"estimated_chips\": 7920}`\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [5,7,9]"}
