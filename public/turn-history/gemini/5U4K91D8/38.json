{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` phase after buying a Celestial Pack. Ante is 3/8, round 5, and I'm looking to prepare for the Big Blind and Boss Blind. I have $11. My Jokers are pretty solid: Juggler gives me extra hand size, Wily Joker boosts Three of a Kind, Shoot the Moon is all about Queens, Scholar loves Aces, and Showman lets me duplicate cards. I'm full on Jokers, no consumables, and a blank Voucher.\n\nNow, the Celestial Pack options: Uranus (Two Pair), Earth (Full House), and Pluto (High Card). Given my Jokers, I'm leaning heavily towards a \"Shoot the Moon\" and \"Scholar\" strategy, with Wily Joker as a nice bonus. My hand levels are all at 1, from Pair to High Card.\n\nLet's break down these planet cards. Uranus seems tricky because I want to keep Queens in hand for *Shoot the Moon* and the Aces for *Scholar*. Forming a Two Pair with Queens is awkward. Earth (Full House) is tempting for a bigger score, but even harder to manage Queens with. Pluto (High Card) seems like a perfect fit, since I can play an Ace while keeping the Queens.\n\nI have $11 and remember that the Director's Cut Voucher is $10. Buying a planet card should be \"free\" since I already paid for the pack. Looking at previous hands, I've played a mix, with Flush, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Full House, and Pair. Given my Jokers, the best play is usually a High Card Ace or a Pair of Aces while holding Queens. So, Pluto, which levels High Card, is the obvious choice. Earth levels Full House, which is great but trickier. Uranus levels Two Pair and is okay. High Card is the most consistent and works perfectly with my \"hold Queens\" strategy.\n\nIf I play a single Ace, I'm getting a base High Card of 5 chips and 1 mult. Scholar gives +20 chips and +4 mult, Shoot the Moon (+10 mult), and holding Queens gives +13 mult each. Leveling High Card with Pluto adds to the total. Full House has a bigger jump, but is less reliable given my hand. In early/mid game, building towards a reliable hand is safer when I have held in hand Jokers. So, the consistent play is often better here.\n\nI need to make sure I don't spend more than $1. Uranus is Two Pair, Earth is a Full House (strong but hard), and Pluto is High Card and very consistent with this build. Looking at previous hands, Pair of Aces has given a lot of chips. A High Card (Ace) also gives a lot. What's the best scaling? Full House is rarely played, Two Pair is occasional, High Card is the most frequent backup.\n\nSo, High Card is the best since I have: Pair Lvl 1, Two Pair Lvl 1, Three of a Kind Lvl 1, and High Card Lvl 1. Pluto is best for \"High Card runs\", but its scaling is slow, while Earth is fast, but I can't hit a Full House as reliably. Pluto is the safest choice for synergy with Shoot the Moon.\n\nI'm ready to select Pluto (3). I re-read the options. 1: Uranus (Two Pair), 2: Earth (Full House), 3: Pluto (High Card). My choice is still Pluto (3). I check if Earth is a better play. Full House, 65/6. High Card, 15/2. I have Scholar (Aces) and Shoot the Moon (Queens). I am likely playing one or two cards at a time. High Card/Pair. Pluto is the best choice.\n\nI double-check to make sure \"Director's Cut\" is a priority for the next step. The current step is `PLANET_PACK`. I'll select Pluto. I check hand logic again. If I am looking for Aces and holding Queens: High Card (Ace) and Queens in hand. Scholar makes the Ace provide the heavy lifting, Pluto makes the High Card slightly better. With Uranus, Two Pair is harder to get. With Earth, Full House is even harder. I look at previous hands: Pair, Flush, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, and Full House. Given my Jokers, High Card is better.\n\nI should check if I missed anything. I re-read my Joker effects. If I play 3 Aces: Base 3oaK is 30 chips, 3 mult. Wily Joker gives +100 chips. Scholar is +60 chips, +12 mult. Shoot the Moon (\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
