{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Blind Select**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at the Blind Select screen for the Boss Blind, and my primary goal is to maximize chips. My current ante is 4/8, and I'm sitting at $0, so I have no real options other than to play the round as is. The Boss Blind, \"The Arm\", is up next, which will decrease the level of the hand I play, which, annoyingly, is going to drop my 3OAK to a lower level hand. I need to make the best of this with the cards I have.\n\nMy current strategy is built around leveraging my Three of a Kind (3OAK), so I need to play that. And to boost it, I have a solid joker setup: I have the Juggler for the +1 hand size, Wily Joker (for +100 chips on the 3OAK), and I have Shoot the Moon (for Mult on Queens), Half Joker (+20 Mult if a limited number of cards are played), and Card Sharp (for X3 Mult on a second hand played this round).\n\nGiven the Boss's effect, I'll need to figure out the right way to play these cards. The best option is to play a \"trash\" 3OAK first, and then a scoring one with Card Sharp. The sequence of Joker activation is crucial, particularly the Holo effect on Shoot the Moon. Let's make sure the order is right: Juggler, Wily, Shoot the Moon (Holo), Half Joker, and Card Sharp. That looks good.\n\nI need to confirm the activation order: Step 4 is for \"held-in-hand\" bonuses, and Step 5 is for Independent Jokers. Shoot the Moon's queen bonuses go in Step 4, and the Holo +10 mult and the other joker effects go in Step 5. That's optimal. This means my order is maximizing the multiplier effect from Shoot the Moon, and multiplying the result by the Card Sharp joker. (Base Mult + Holo Mult + Half Joker Mult) * Card Sharp Mult, with the Queen bonuses from Shoot the Moon thrown in first.\n\nI've got no money, no consumables to use or sell, and my Joker order is optimal. My hand is set, and I'm at the Blind Select screen. My command to proceed is clearly `play_round`. Okay, let's get this show on the road.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
