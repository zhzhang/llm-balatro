{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment for the Blind Select**\n\nOkay, so I'm in a tricky spot: Blind Select, Ante 3, Small Blind. Need 2000 chips. I have a Holographic Tag tempting me to skip, but I'm thinking...is that really the best move? I've got a decent hand, and $8 in my pocket. My Jokers are Juggler, Wily Joker, Shoot the Moon, Scholar, and Showman. Nice synergy overall, especially with the Shoot the Moon (though it won't be good for the Boss).\n\nThe Holographic Tag grants a free Holographic Joker *next* shop. But I have a full Joker slots. I need to sell one.\n\nMy thought is to either:\n\n1.  **Skip:** Get the Holographic Tag (but no money).\n2.  **Play:** Win a reward ($3 + $1 interest), visit a shop, and then play Big Blind, get another reward ($4 + interest), then visit the shop again.\n\nSkipping gets me the Holographic Tag. But is that better than more shop visits and money *right now*? I need money to buy stuff anyway. Plus, with the Showman, more shop visits are better. So, playing the round is more valuable than one random Holographic Joker when I already have a decent setup. 2000 chips is easily reachable with the Wily Joker chip boost, and Scholar can provide a nice multiplier (especially with Aces).\n\nNow, the Boss Blind is a pain with \"All face cards are drawn face down.\" That's bad for Shoot the Moon. I need to make a plan to deal with that, maybe a Director's Cut joker, or focus on a non-face card hand (Aces/Flushes are good).\n\nMy plan is to *play* the round. I'll aim for a three of a kind. This is the best use of my Jokers at this moment, especially with Wily Joker. A 3 of a kind of Aces could be huge: (30 + 100 (Wily Joker) + 20\\*3) \\* (3 + 4\\*3 + 10 (Holographic) ). That's a huge potential score (4750).\n\nSo, the optimal action is to play.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"three of a kind\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 4000\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
