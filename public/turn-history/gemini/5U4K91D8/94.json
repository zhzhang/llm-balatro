{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Blind Select - The Head**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 10, Ante 5/8. This is the \"Blind Select\" stage, and the boss is \"The Head,\" meaning all Heart cards are debuffed. I've got $23 to work with, and the target score for this round is 22,000. My current build revolves around Three of a Kind (3OAK), which is leveled to Level 1.\n\nMy Joker lineup is pretty solid: Juggler gives me the extra hand size, Wily Joker adds +100 chips for a 3OAK, Shoot the Moon provides +13 Mult for each Queen held and +10 for holo, Half Joker gives +20 Mult if I play a hand of 3 cards or less, and Card Sharp triples my Mult if I replay the same hand. Antimatter gives me access to a max of 6 Jokers.\n\nThe crucial thing here is understanding how the Heart debuff works with the Jokers. Debuffed cards *still* count toward the 3OAK, but they give no chips and don't trigger \"when scored\" or \"when held\" abilities. Importantly, Shoot the Moon relies on having Queens in hand, and Heart Queens won't trigger that particular effect. But I can play Heart Queens and still complete the 3OAK hand.\n\nLet's break down the scoring. A basic 3OAK will give me about 130-160 chips (depending on the card ranks) plus 3 base mult. Add to that Wily Joker's +100 chips, the Half Joker's +20 mult, and the Shoot the Moon Holo's +10 mult and each Queen in hand adds another +13 mult. If I then replay the hand, Card Sharp will triple the mult from the second play.\n\nSo, let's say I go with non-Queen cards (3x 10s). The first play nets around 9,440. Then I repeat for 28,320. Total: 37,760, which far exceeds the 22,000 target.\n\nEven if I draw *only* Heart Queens, I can still get pretty close to the 22,000 target. In that worst-case scenario, the first play would result in 5,280, and the second 15,840 for a total of 21,120.\n\nNow, I *do* have a \"Director's Cut\" voucher that lets me reroll the boss for $10. I have $23 right now. Is it worth it? The Heart debuff is only a problem if I depend on Heart Queens, which is unlikely given I have 4 suits. Even with 0 good Queens, I'm almost there in two hands. I can find other Queens by discarding if necessary.\n\nIn terms of the Joker order, I need to make sure the multiplicative effect of Card Sharp is last. Since all the additive mults apply before, the order is optimal: Wily Joker, Half Joker, Shoot the Moon. Card Sharp is in the correct slot.\n\nThe optimal Joker order will trigger all the additive mults before applying the X3 mult.\n\nSo, I'm going to `play_round` as is. There's no pressing need to reroll. I'll take my chances and focus on finding non-Heart Queens. The build is strong. I am comfortable with this plan.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
