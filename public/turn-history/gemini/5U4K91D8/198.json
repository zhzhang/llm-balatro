{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Ante 8 Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the Ante 8 Boss blind with 300,000 chips needed to win, with a starting chip count of zero. I have four hands to get there. My hand has a Juggler joker (which isn't useful right now), a Wily Joker (which adds 100 chips for a 3OAK), Shoot the Moon (good with Queens), a Half Joker (good for a low-card hand), a Card Sharp (multiplies mult if I play a hand I've already played this round), and a Chicot (which disables the boss effect and has polychrome). I have a Gold Queen of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 9 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, Queen of Diamonds (a Holo), two 9 of Diamonds, and a 5 of Diamonds in my hand.\n\nMy strategy needs to be focused: a Three of a Kind using three cards or fewer will trigger Half Joker and I can keep the Queens in hand for Shoot the Moon. I need to get as much mult as possible.\n\nI've got three 9s (at indices 3, 7, and 8). I have two Queens. If I play the 9s, I get Wily Joker (100 chips), Half Joker (+20 mult), and Shoot the Moon (+10 mult from Holo and +13 mult for each Queen in hand), with Chicot at X1.5. This will set up Card Sharp for later hands.\n\nThe 9s are worth 9 chips each (27 total), and the 3OAK has a base value of 130 chips. Add Wily Joker for another 100, which is 257 chips total. The mult is 13 (base) + 10 (Holo) + 20 (Half Joker) + 26 (Shoot the Moon, 2 Queens) for 69 total mult. Chicot is X1.5, making this 103.5 effective mult. The first hand: 257 * 103.5 = 26,599.5 chips.\n\nThe *second* hand onwards benefits from Card Sharp, and mult will become X3! So Hand 2: 69 * 1.5 * 3 = 310.5. Hand 2: 257 * 310.5 = 79,798.5. Assuming the remaining hands are approximately 80k, then that's about 266k in total, which means I'll need to find more Queens, level up my 3OAK, or get lucky on the discards.\n\nLet's double check my logic. The 9s *are* in my hand, with two 9 of Diamonds (yes, deck manipulation is part of the game). Okay, the action is going to be \"play\" with cards at positions [3, 7, 8], targeting a \"three of a kind.\" The estimated chips are 26600. So I'm going to play [3, 7, 8] for a three of a kind.\n\nCard Sharp only triggers after playing a hand *this round*. Shoot the Moon triggers as before.\n\nThe play is to \"play\" the \"three of a kind\" with positions [3, 7, 8]. I estimate about 26,600 chips from this initial play.\n\nThe user's previous play history says that a 3OAK is worth ~26k in the first hand.\nThen after setting up Card Sharp, it's worth ~80-96k.\n\nLet's double check the numbers.\nI'm holding two queens. (1,6).\nPlaying 3 cards = yes to Half Joker.\nCards to play: 3, 7, 8.\n\nThe JSON is:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [3, 7, 8],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"three of a kind\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 26600\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,7,8]"}
