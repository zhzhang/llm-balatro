{"reasoning":"**Early Game Shop Decision - Buffoon Pack Prioritized**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 2, Round 1 with $12 to spend. I've got a decent starting hand and some solid Jokers: Juggler (hand size), Wily Joker (Three of a Kind chips), and the fantastic Shoot the Moon (Holo +10 Mult, which is a huge early game boost!). \"The Sun\" consumable is there to convert cards to Hearts, which has potential.\n\nThe shop is showing Arrowhead (Spades), a Buffoon Pack, an Arcana Pack, and a Blank Voucher. I immediately dismiss the voucher – too expensive at this stage. Arrowhead is tempting chip-wise but isn't core to any immediate strategy. I'm focusing on scaling right now.\n\nMy thought process zeroes in on filling my Joker slots. I have 3/5 slots filled, and early-game, more Jokers = more potential for better multipliers. The **Buffoon Pack** is the clear front-runner here for $4 since it has the potential to offer a better joker.\n\nThe **Arcana Pack**, for another $4, is my second option for deck manipulation or a good consumable. It’s also viable, but I'll start with the Buffoon Pack. Even if the pack isn't ideal, I'll still be left with $8, enough to potentially buy the Arcana Pack or Arrowhead (if the new Joker isn't immediately strong).\n\nSo, the action is to buy the Buffoon Pack. And I'm ready to see if it improves my board state!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
