{"reasoning":"**The Strategic Shop Dilemma**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 7, Round 15, and the blinds are about to get serious. I've got $6, a solid 3OAK build going, and a clutch of Jokers I've carefully curated. The question is: what to buy in the shop?\n\nThe main options are: Gift Card, which increases sell value, or a Jumbo Spectral Pack. The Gift Card sounds tempting, increasing the sell value on my Jokers and Consumable by $1 each round. But with only 5 rounds left, that's maybe $35 total. It's helpful. BUT, it means I have to sell a Joker. I'd have to sell Juggler (+1 hand size), which is very, very hard.\n\nI've already figured that Spectral Packs are often the best buys, because they have the potential to deliver a game-changer. An Ankh could be disastrous, but an Ouija or Ectoplasm could give me the boost I need. I'm hoping for a strong Spectral card to help clear these upcoming blinds. I'm heavily focused on 3OAK, and I believe in the power of a good Spectral card to carry me.\n\nNow, do I gamble on a Spectral pack, or save for interest? Since I only have $6, saving gives me $1 interest, which is not really a game changer. The Spectral Pack is my best bet.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'm going to buy the Jumbo Spectral Pack. I just need a powerful Spectral card to seal the deal on this run. My hand size is already quite big (10 cards), so Ectoplasm is not that bad. Ouija would be amazing.\n\nI can't use \"The Lovers\" yet - better to save it in case I get something useful.\n\nI could try to analyze the value of Gift Card again. Buying it is tough. I'd have to sell Juggler. I'd get the bonus sell value every round. It is still hard. It's the end-game and I'd rather have the direct impact of a spectral pack.\n\nHere's the final plan: `buy_booster` with position `2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
