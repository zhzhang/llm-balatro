{"reasoning":"**Analysis: Buffoon Pack Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase of this `BUFFOON_PACK` game. Ante 2, Round 2. $59 in the bank. I've got a decent hand: 5/5 jokers (Greedy Joker, The Idol, Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, Hanging Chad). I have 0/2 consumables, which is fine, but not relevant. Let's see what's on offer.\n\nThe pack gives me: Jolly Joker (+8 Mult if I have a Pair), Square Joker (+4 Chips if hand has exactly 4 cards), Marble Joker (Adds a Stone card to the deck), and Credit Card (Debt, up to -$20).\n\nLooking at the current Jokers: `Greedy Joker` with +3 Mult on Diamonds is good, synergizing with any Diamonds in my hand. `The Idol` gives x2 Mult on Jack of Diamonds, and `Ancient Joker` x1.5 Mult on Hearts, both great for multiplier. `Ice Cream` is a flat +95 chips that decays, and `Hanging Chad` retriggers the first card twice which is crucial with those \"on-scored\" jokers.\n\nThe pack choices aren't that strong. `Jolly Joker`'s +8 Mult is okay but not as good as XMult effects, and +Mult is generally less valuable than scaling effects. `Square Joker` requires a specific playstyle, and with `Ice Cream` providing +95 chips right now, it's not worth it. `Marble Joker` gives Stone cards, which provide +50 chips but it doesn't synergize with my current setup. Finally, I don't need `Credit Card` with $59.\n\nMy current jokers have good synergy: `The Idol`, `Ancient Joker` provide XMult, and `Hanging Chad` triples those XMult values if the first card matches. `Ice Cream` is a huge chip buffer right now. None of the pack choices are better than what I have, and I don't want to mess with the synergy I've built.\n\nIf I pick a joker, I must sell one of the current ones because I'm at 5/5. Selling is better because it's free money. I could pick a joker and sell it, and get a small amount of money, but I would have to sell one of my current jokers.\n\nLet's look at sell values. Jolly ($1), Square ($1), Marble ($2), Credit Card ($1). My current sell values are: Greedy ($2), Idol ($3), Ice Cream ($2), Ancient ($4), Hanging Chad ($2). Selling a $2 joker to pick up a $2 Marble Joker is net zero, no gain in the transaction. Selling a $2 Joker to pick up a $1 is a loss. There's no reason to swap, as my current build is strong.\n\nI should `skip_booster` to keep my current lineup and synergy.\n\nWait, is `Marble Joker` worth it long-term? The Stone card is +50, but if `Hanging Chad` re-triggers it, it's 50 + 50 + 50 = 150. But, the Stones don't have suits so they don't trigger my `Ancient Joker` or `The Idol` effects. The current build needs suits. I don't need the `Credit Card`.\n\nMy decision is `skip_booster`.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
