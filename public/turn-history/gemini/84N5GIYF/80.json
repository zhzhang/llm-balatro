{"reasoning":"**Blind Selection Decision - Ante 4, Round 6**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 4, Round 6. The game step is \"BLIND\\_SELECT\", and I have $4. My Joker setup is looking pretty strong: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, two Hanging Chads, and Smeared Joker. I also have the Planet Merchant, Hone, and Reroll Surplus vouchers. The immediate decision: Small Blind or Skip for a Rare Tag.\n\nLet's break it down. Playing the Small Blind gives me $3 plus interest (which is minimal at my current cash), roughly a $4 gain. Skipping gets me a Rare Tag, which guarantees a free Rare Joker in the next shop. Rare Jokers can be incredibly powerful; think Blueprint, Brainstorm, or The Trio.\n\nMy gut says *skip*, and here's why. I'm heavily leaning towards Flushes with Smeared Joker. The Ancient Joker's Diamond suit modifier is solid when I can set that up. The two Hanging Chads are going to retrigger my first played card and multiply things further, providing solid multiplier strength.\n\nThe Rare Tag offers a significant power and economic boost by essentially saving me $8-10. My funds are low, and this builds economy. While I could use that $3 and shop refresh, my setup is likely strong enough to handle the Big Blind without that extra boost. Skipping also means I preserve my Ice Cream Joker, since it only decays if I play.\n\nThere is a small caveat: I don't know the Ancient Joker's *new* suit yet, as it changes at the end of the round. However, the decision is still to *skip*. Skipping means I don't play the Small Blind, and get the free joker in the shop after the Big Blind.\n\nIs there any reason *not* to skip? The game's economy is tight, but Rare Jokers help far more with power.\n\nThe action is clearly to `skip_round`. I need to generate valid JSON now.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"skip_round\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nOkay, the Rare Tag it is. Let's see what that next Rare Joker brings!\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
