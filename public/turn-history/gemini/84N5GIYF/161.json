{"reasoning":"**Okay, here's the game plan, as I see it:**\n\nWe're at Ante 8, facing the Big Blind next. I've got $7 and need to hit 75,000 to move on. Previous round was 178,818, which is more than enough, but now the Ancient Joker is Spades/Clubs and not Hearts. Flush is the current strategy.\n\nI have a decent Joker setup: Ancient Joker (Spades/Clubs), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker (Spades=Clubs, Hearts=Diamonds), Stuntman (chip boost), and the annoying 8 Ball (chance for Tarot cards). I'm capped at 6 Jokers with the 8 Ball.\n\nLooking at the shop, the *Spare Trousers* are useless for a Flush deck. The *Walkie Talkie* is tempting for chip and Multiplier synergy with the Hanging Chads, but it's not a priority. I'd probably have to sell a good Joker to get it and I have a great setup already.\n\nThe real prize here is the *Jumbo Arcana Pack* for $6. I could find a \"The World\" or \"The Moon\" to further optimize my Spades/Clubs count, or other useful cards to help the deck, like money, other bonuses, or even a Glass Card. The *Jumbo Standard Pack* is less interesting right now.\n\nMy immediate options are:\n\n*   **Option A:** Buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack, leaving me with $1.\n*   **Option B:** Buy the Walkie Talkie ($4), which is probably bad, requiring me to sell a current Joker.\n*   **Option C:** Save the money and hope for interest to help next round, but I can easily take out the Big Blind with what I have.\n\nGiven the Spades/Clubs suit switch and the need for deck consistency for a flush, the Jumbo Arcana Pack is the clear winner. I need to make sure I have enough Spades and Clubs in my deck. It gives the best chance to find a suit-converting Arcana or a useful Joker. My current money ($7) also covers the pack ($6).\n\nMy current Joker order is good for the current setup (Ancient, Chad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman, 8 Ball).\n\nTherefore, the action is: `buy_booster 1` (Jumbo Arcana Pack, position 1 in the store), which I'll execute after double-checking the command structure. I need to keep in mind I need to have a great run for the Big Blind to keep progressing.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
