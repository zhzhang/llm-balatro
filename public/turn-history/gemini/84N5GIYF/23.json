{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 2, Round 2, and the shop's up. I've got $59, and the inventory is looking decent with five Jokers: Greedy (Diamonds +3 Mult), The Idol (JD x2 Mult), Ice Cream (+95 Chips), Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5 Mult), and Hanging Chad (Retriggers). No consumables or vouchers are equipped currently. The shop is empty of cards and boosters, and the Hone voucher is available for $10. Reroll costs $5.\n\nI've got a solid joker setup for this early stage. I'm thinking long-term here, so upgrading future joker potential is key. With $59 and Ante 2, Hone seems like a smart purchase; it'll improve the odds of getting better editions on future cards and Jokers. It's an investment, and I can definitely afford it.\n\nLet me quickly re-evaluate the Joker setup to make sure it's optimized. Hanging Chad retriggers the first card played, regardless of Chad's position. Scoring is left-to-right. Jokers like Ancient, Idol, and Greedy are \"on scored\" effects; they trigger when the card scores, but my understanding is the order of these jokers matters. So, playing a Jack of Diamonds first would look like: base score + Greedy (+3 Mult) + The Idol (x2 Mult) + Ancient (if Hearts). Chad then repeats that.\n\nI need to confirm the order of the Jokers to make sure the math is correct. I believe that since Greedy, Idol, and Ancient are \"on scored\" effects, the inventory order dictates their priority. Independent Jokers are activated left to right. Okay, let's look at the rules to confirm this, because it seems important to get this order right for the long run. Okay, Category 3 is for \"on scored\" jokers, and category 5 is \"independent\" jokers, and this helps re-enforce the order of play. My current inventory order is: Greedy (+3), Idol (x2), Ice Cream (+Chips), Ancient (x1.5).\n\nSo, for card scoring, Greedy triggers first, then Idol triggers, and then Ancient (if it's a Heart). The inventory order is optimal.\n\nI think the immediate play is to buy Hone, leaving me with $49. The shop has no cards, and I am not able to buy any booster packs, so, it makes sense to reroll to potentially find better jokers or planets that can increase the effectiveness of various hand types. I can afford to reroll a few times, and that will be my next step.\n\nMy next action will be to buy the Hone voucher. Then, I'll reroll the shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
