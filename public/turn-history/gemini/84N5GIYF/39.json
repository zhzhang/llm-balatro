{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Deliberations**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Shop Phase, Ante 3, Round 3. I've got $26. My Joker lineup is decent: Ice Cream (decaying, but still chips), Ancient Joker (diamond multiplier), Hanging Chad (retrigger), Invisible Joker (about to activate), and Rocket (scales with Bosses). Vouchers are Planet Merchant (double planet frequency) and Hone (double foil/holo/poly frequency). The shop itself presents an interesting choice: Stuntman (massive chip boost, but -2 hand size), and a Standard Pack (potential value).\n\nThe immediate objective is to beat this round, with an eye on Invisible Joker. Rocket will scale on Bosses, Ancient Joker works on Diamonds. Stuntman is tempting, that +250 chip bonus is huge. But that -2 hand size (down to 6) really hurts the Flush potential I'm aiming for given my Ancient Joker synergy with Diamonds. The Ace of Clubs Polychrome Wild I just grabbed also favors Flushes. Ice Cream is the obvious Joker to sell if I buy Stuntman.\n\nMy first thought was to grab the Standard Pack first. But then I have to think about the long game. I've already bought the Jumbo Booster earlier. My Joker slots are full, Invisible Joker is ready *after* the next round. If Invisible Joker hits Stuntman, that -4 hand size is a disaster. If I buy Standard Pack, I can still get another good card. Hmm, if I buy Standard Pack, I will have $22.\n\nThe +250 chips on Stuntman is very strong for the early-mid game, and could easily carry through Ante 4-5. The chips from Stuntman + the Multipliers from Ancient/Chad/Poly will be huge. The problem is that -2 hand size, even with the Polychrome Wild Ace I got, really makes it much harder to find those Flushes to trigger the Ancient Joker multiplier. If I don't buy Stuntman, I keep an 8 hand size and can lean on Ice Cream.\n\nOkay, let's go for the Standard Pack. *Action: buy\\_booster 1*.\n\nWait... did I buy that already? Yes, I did. I've been overzealous. I now only see the *Standard Pack*. I should buy the *Standard Pack* as the first card in the Shop.\n\nWait, should I buy Stuntman? Should I sell Ice Cream and buy Stuntman? Ice Cream is +90. Stuntman is +250.\n\nI should check the hand size again. With Stuntman, it's 6. Now, if I have 6 cards, it will be much harder to find 5 cards of a specific suit. But the +250 chips is nearly enough to win rounds on its own in Ante 3. The 160 chip boost is worth the -2 hand size.\n\nI'll prioritize the Standard Pack first, see if I can get anything useful.\n\nThe user select 2 in the Jumbo Pack.\n\nNow the Shop looks like: Stuntman ($7) and Standard Pack ($4). I will buy the *Standard Pack* .\n\nOkay, I'll buy Standard Pack. *Action: buy\\_booster 1* (Standard Pack).\n\nWait, should I check the Stuntman again? Should I sell Ice Cream and get Stuntman? If I buy Stuntman, I have a 6 hand size. Stuntman gives +250 chips, but if Invisible Joker hits Stuntman, it becomes really bad.\n\nIf I don't want Invisible Joker to hit Stuntman, I should keep the pool \"clean\" or sell the one I don't want to get hit right before Invisible Joker.\n\nHowever, Invisible Joker picks a *random* Joker. If I have Stuntman, it might hit that.\n\nSo, let's stick to the Standard Pack for now.\n\n*Action: buy\\_booster 1* (Standard Pack).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
