{"reasoning":"**Blind Select Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's round 17, and the boss, \"The Crimson Heart,\" is going to disable a random Joker each hand. I need 100,000 chips, and I only have $3 right now. My Jokers are: Ancient Joker (Hearts X1.5), two Hanging Chads, a Smeared Joker, Stuntman, and an 8 Ball. I'm focusing on Flush Level 5, which gives me 95 chips and 12 mult.\n\nMy current action is Blind Select. I'm in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase.\n\nLet me think this through. The Ancient Joker is currently Hearts based on previous shop logic. The Smeared Joker makes Hearts and Diamonds both count for the Ancient Joker. The Hanging Chads will essentially multiply the first card played in the flush. The Stuntman gives a massive chip boost. And, of course, the boss is going to remove one of my Jokers at random each hand.\n\nI'm in the BLIND_SELECT phase, so the only valid action is `play_round`. I have no consumables or need to sell any jokers, since my setup is optimal. The boss effect is active during the round, not during Blind Select.\n\nThe action I need to take is \"play_round.\" There are no positions, intended hand type, or estimated chips, so those are all null values. I've double-checked the schema and all the requirements, including the crucial single-line JSON output, the JSON structure, the string double quotes, and the lack of any control tokens.\n\nSo, here's the final command I need: `{\"action\":\"play_round\",\"positions\":null,\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}`\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
