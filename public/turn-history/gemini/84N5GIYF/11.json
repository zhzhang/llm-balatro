{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Assessment: Prioritizing Long-Term Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. It's Ante 2, Round 1. I've got $27, and the immediate interest goal is clear – keep $25 to maximize the $5 interest gain. This is key for the long game. I have some solid jokers: Greedy Joker (+3 Mult per Diamond), The Idol (X2 Mult if a 3 of Diamonds is scored), and Ice Cream (+100 Chips, decreasing per hand). I've already optimized the joker order, placing Greedy Joker before The Idol to get its effect on the Idol's outcome.\n\nMy initial thought was to look at the shop: There's a Standard Pack for $4, or a Hone Voucher for $10. I also considered Reroll, but I don't see any cards that will improve my score and should save my rerolls for later. The Hone is far too expensive, and rerolling is wasteful with these jokers. The deck needs Diamonds for Greedy Joker and general flushes or the 3 of Diamonds for The Idol. Buying the Standard Pack would drop my money to $23, dropping the interest gain to $4.\n\nA quick calculation suggests I have a very strong position to clear this ante without further investments. I'm thinking I can likely make over 2500 chips with a flush and potentially over 5000 with a flush containing the 3 of Diamonds. The requirement for the blinds is usually far less than this, so it seems like I'm sitting pretty comfortably.\n\nI'm leaning towards keeping the $27 and the full $5 interest. The Standard Pack might give me a Diamond or a 3, but is that one card worth the $1 interest loss in the short term, and any potential long-term snowball effect of losing interest? Probably not. The current joker setup is already dominant for this ante. Let's look at the money situation again - $27. Saving ensures $5 interest.\n\nI'll choose `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
