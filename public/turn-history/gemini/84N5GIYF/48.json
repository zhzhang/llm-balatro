{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Celestial Pack Choice**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in the SHOP, staring down this Mega Celestial Pack. I just grabbed `Jupiter`, which gave me a Flush. Now I need to select my second card. The goal is to maximize my early game, and I'm assessing the remaining options: `Earth` (Full House), `Pluto` (High Card), `Mercury` (Pair), and `Mars` (Four of a Kind).\n\nConsidering my Joker setup – Ice Cream, Ancient Joker (heart multiplier!), and two Hanging Chads – I'm leaning heavily towards hands that incorporate Hearts to exploit Ancient Joker. I'm also thinking Flushes are strong, but I already have one of those at level 2.\n\nLet's break down the card choices: `Earth` (Full House) gives me +2 Mult and +25 Chips, and will be at 65 Chips and 6 Mult at Level 2. `Mars` (Four of a Kind) offers +3 Mult and +30 Chips, rising to 90 Chips and 10 Mult at Level 2. `Mercury` and `Pluto` are looking a little weak by comparison.\n\nI'm thinking that Full House is more *reliable* to hit, especially this early, before deck manipulation. I've already pulled a Full House in the last ante. Ancient Joker boosts the Hearts. While Four of a Kind scales better, it's just much harder to land reliably in the early game. So, the play here is to build a foundation.\n\nSo I'm going to take `Earth`, which is at position 1. I'm going to be building for a \"full house\" strategy here. This Earth will bump my Full House from Level 1 to Level 2. This is looking solid.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
