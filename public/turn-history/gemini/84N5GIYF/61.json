{"reasoning":"**Strategic Joker Selection: The Club Blind**\n\nAlright, Ante 3, Round 5, Shop phase. The dreaded \"The Club\" blind is next, which debuffs Clubs. My current hand is looking pretty good, but I need to optimize for the boss coming up. I've got a solid Joker setup: Ancient Joker (Clubs multiplier), Ice Cream (chip boost), two Hanging Chads (retriggering), and a Rocket (economy). Joker capacity is maxed out at 5/5.\n\nMy key piece is the Ancient Joker, set to Clubs, which gives a 1.5x multiplier *per* Club played. I need to maximize this. But... the boss! It debuffs Clubs, so any Club I play will be useless in terms of chips.\n\nThen I see it: Smeared Joker. It costs $7, but it's the key. This Joker converts Hearts to Diamonds and Spades to Clubs. If I buy it, I can play Spades and they'll count as Clubs for the Ancient Joker multiplier but *won't* be debuffed by the boss. This is crucial!\n\nThe plan is to use Ancient Joker, a Spade via the Smeared Joker, and then double the effect of the first played card with the two Hanging Chads. I can trigger 3x the Ancient Joker multiplier (1 initial, 2 retriggers)! This seems perfect.\n\nI have $27. I need to sell a Joker to free up a slot to buy the Smeared Joker. Which one to ditch? Ice Cream is great for chips, but it's decaying, and I'm at a critical point. Rocket is an uncommon. It currently pays out $5 per round, so it's good for the long game but not critical now, and not as useful as Ice Cream in the short term. I have enough money, and this boss is about survival. I think Rocket has to go. It's the most disposable for the immediate boss.\n\n*   Sell Joker: Rocket (position 4)\n*   Buy Joker: Smeared Joker (position 1)\n\nMy action must be a JSON action to perform. I have to sell a Joker first.\n\n*   Action: `sell_joker`\n*   Position: 4 (Rocket)\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
