{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Choosing the Right Joker**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 2, Round 1. I'm looking at my Buffoon Pack choices. I've got The Idol Joker, currently doubling the mult of Diamonds. My money is at $32. The previous two hands were a Straight Flush and a Flush (both Diamonds!).\n\nMy options are the Vampire Joker and the Greedy Joker. Let's break this down.\n\nVampire? It's a scaling joker; it gains multiplier based on *Enhanced* cards played. The problem is I have zero Enhanced cards in my current deck. Vampire starts at x1, so it’s useless at the moment and requires me to find Tarot cards. The long-term upside is fantastic, but in the immediate term, it's dead weight. I'm going to need to rely on Tarot cards to get Vampire going.\n\nNow, Greedy Joker. This one gives +3 Mult for every Diamond I score. *The Idol* is already targeting Diamonds. Let's see... last turn I played a Straight Flush and a Flush (both diamonds). I have 13 Diamonds in the deck (including the 7 in my hand for turn 6). I've run a quick deck count to be sure. A Flush is +4 base Mult, but with the Greedy Joker, it goes up to +19, and then *The Idol* doubles that to +38. That's a huge early-game boost.\n\nVampire is top-tier later, but Greedy is excellent now! I'm only in Ante 2 with $32 and just starting. The Greedy Joker will provide immediate value; it's the more reliable choice. No question.\n\nThe action is `select` and the pack card position is `[2]`. No intended hand type or estimated chips at this point.\n\nThe JSON should look like this: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`\n\nOne more check - is there any reason to take Vampire? Not unless I can immediately find enhancements. Greedy helps win *now*. Given that I can afford to hunt for enhancements later with $32, I will take Greedy Joker. And then I’ll buy Ice Cream from the shop; Chips plus Mult makes a great foundation.\n\nCommand: `select 2`\n\nFinal JSON: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
