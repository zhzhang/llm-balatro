{"reasoning":"**Flush Hunt in Round 14**\n\nOkay, here we are, Round 14, Small Blind, 35,000 chips. Feeling pretty good with $1 in the bank. Time to make the most of this hand. Game step: SELECTING_HAND.\n\nMy hand is looking promising for a flush: 7 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, King of Clubs (Multiplier), 6 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds (Bonus), and 9 of Diamonds. With these Jokers in play – Ancient Joker (x1.5 Mult on Hearts, triggered by a Heart flush, and Smeared Joker making Hearts and Diamonds effectively the same), and two Hanging Chads that double the trigger on the first card, plus Stuntman and 8 Ball tarot card (which I'll save) – I'm aiming for maximum multiplier potential here.\n\nMy target is to get to 35,000 chips. I have a clear goal: Form a Heart/Diamond flush to really leverage that Ancient Joker. 7H, 4H, AD, and 9D are already in the deck.\n\nI need just one more Heart or Diamond to complete it. My Ancient Joker is set to trigger on Hearts which, thanks to the Smeared Joker, will also trigger on Diamonds. If I make a flush with a Heart/Diamond in the first position, that card will have five Ancient triggers (1 base + 2 from each Hanging Chad). The remaining cards will each trigger the Ancient Joker once. That's a total of 9 triggers, which is a multiplier of 38.4x!\n\nSo, with that in mind, I need to discard the King of Clubs and 6 of Clubs. They're just dead weight here. Let's send the `discard` command for cards at positions 3 and 4. I could use the Strength card on the 9D, but I'll save that. The World card won't help here.\n\nI have 3 discards left, so I'm hoping I can pull one more Heart or Diamond. The odds aren't bad. Let's see... with 46 cards left in the deck, I have a 26/46 chance. That's favorable odds.\n\nAlright, time to get rid of cards at positions 3 and 4. Time to `discard` with arguments `[3, 4]`. Now let's see what happens. I'm ready to roll.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4]"}
