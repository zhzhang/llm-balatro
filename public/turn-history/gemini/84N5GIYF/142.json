{"reasoning":"**Strategic Planet Selection for Optimal Hand Enhancement**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at the Mega Celestial Pack again. I need to pick a second planet card. I already nabbed Earth (Full House) in the previous round, and that was in position 3 originally. The deck has shifted and that is no longer there. Looking at the remaining options: Mars (Four of a Kind), Neptune (Straight Flush), Pluto (High Card), and Venus (Three of a Kind).\n\nConsidering my current hand with the Stuntman debuff, I'm at a small hand size, so I'm focusing on flushes. I've got the Smeared Joker and the Ancient Joker, and the Ancient Joker wants Spades. I also have \"The World,\" which is a very useful card to create Spades, but since Jupiter (Flush) isn't an option here, I have to figure out the best backup plan.\n\nI have:\n*   Flush: Level 3\n*   Full House: Level 6 (This is a good one!)\n*   Three of a Kind: Level 3\n*   High Card: Level 2\n\nI think upgrading either Three of a Kind (Venus) or High Card (Pluto) is the safest bet. I see Venus (Three of a Kind) is currently in position 4, and Pluto (High Card) is in position 3.\n\nLet's see: upgrading Three of a Kind (Lvl 3 -> 4) gives me +20 chips and +2 mult. Upgrading High Card (Lvl 2 -> 3) gives me +10 chips and +1 mult. Mars (Four of a Kind) and Neptune (Straight Flush) are, frankly, tough to hit with a tiny hand.\n\nNow, Three of a Kind is useful, it can be a part of a Full House, and I already picked that. And if I can't hit a flush, it's something I can use. So, I should definitely check the current hand levels again. Three of a Kind is Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7. High Card is Level 2, Base Chips 15, Base Mult 2.\n\nIf I boost Three of a Kind to Level 4, it's 90 chips, 9 mult! And Level 3 High Card is only 25 chips, 3 mult. Venus (Three of a Kind) is the play. It offers more immediate value and I can still see how to get it into play with my deck.\n\nSo, the command is `select <pack_card_position>`. Position 4 is Venus. **Action: select 4**\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
