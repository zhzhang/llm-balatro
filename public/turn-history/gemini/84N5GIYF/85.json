{"reasoning":"**Ante 4, Round 7: Shop Optimization**\n\nOkay, it's Round 7 and I'm in the SHOP phase. I've got $13 to work with. My primary goal is to prepare for the Boss Blind, which requires 10,000 chips and, crucially, *no discards*. This no-discard condition is the key. I need to figure out which Blind it is, as it's likely \"The Needle\", \"The Water\", or \"The Psychic\". Given I need to play all cards, likely one of these.\n\nMy Jokers are:\n\n1.  **Ancient Joker:** This one's critical. It gives a 1.5x multiplier *if* a Heart is played.\n2.  **Hanging Chad (x2):** This retriggers the first card played, and this joker appears twice!\n3.  **Smeared Joker:** Makes Hearts and Diamonds the same suit, and Spades/Clubs the same, which is good for hand construction (Flushes, Straights).\n4.  **Stuntman:** +300 Chips, but *significantly* reduces my hand size to 6. This is a bit of a challenge, but I just bought it.\n\nMy current hand size is limited to 6 cards. The reduced hand size is a concern given the need to play all cards.\n\nNow, let's look at the Shop options:\n\n1.  **The High Priestess ($3):** Creates 2 random Planet cards. This is good for hand level increases.\n2.  **Arcana Pack ($4):** This is high priority to fix the deck (more Hearts).\n3.  **Celestial Pack ($4):** Also good for hand-level increases.\n\nMy Vouchers include: Planet Merchant, Hone, and Reroll Surplus.\n\nMy current strategy, with my Jokers, is a **Hanging Chad (x2) + Hanging Chad (x2) + Ancient Joker (x1.5) combo.** If I play a Heart in the first slot: the Heart card will score, then re-trigger twice from the first Chad, twice from the second Chad, a total of 5 triggers at 1.5x. That's a huge 7.59x multiplier from a single Heart (1.5^5)! Plus, Stuntman adds 300 chips. Finding Hearts for the Ancient Joker trigger is now more difficult. I need consistency.\n\nConsidering my limited hand size and the potential for no discards, I need to focus on drawing Hearts.\n\nMoney: $13.\n\nThe High Priestess is a great value, potentially providing two Planet cards for only $3.\n\nArcana Pack at $4, I need this to help add Hearts to the deck.\n\nCelestial Pack is also good, but The High Priestess is cheaper for generating 2 cards.\n\nLet's prioritize: Buy High Priestess, use High Priestess, then buy the Arcana Pack.\n\nI can buy and use the High Priestess immediately (no targeting).\n\n`buy_and_use_consumable 1` would work. It's position 1. High Priestess is a great value for the price.\n\nI have 0/2 consumables.\n\nI'll check the previous round's action: It's just a card purchase.\n\nNow, I'll `buy_and_use_consumable 1`.\n\nThe *reasoning* is to strengthen my hand levels and ensure reliable Ancient Joker triggers.\n\n*   I check the user's previous action (buying Stuntman).\n*   The money is $13.\n*   I will buy and use High Priestess.\n*   Action: `buy_and_use_consumable`\n*   Position: `1`\n\nA quick check on Ancient Joker: Smeared Joker means that Hearts and Diamonds make a hand type (e.g. Flush), but Ancient Joker only cares about the *printed* card suit.\n\nOkay, I'll execute that. And check on the schema.\n\nThe schema matches the command structure: `buy_and_use_consumable`. I need to provide an integer for position.\n\nThe \"buy\\_and\\_use\\_consumable\" is the correct command.\n\nSelf correction: With Ancient Joker and Smeared Joker: I can build a flush. But Ancient Joker only activates on Hearts.\n\nOkay, plan: I will buy and *use* the High Priestess.\n\nChecking again: High Priestess is better value than the Celestial Pack, despite the Arcana Pack's long-term value. I can still afford the Arcana Pack after.\n\nFinal Execution: `buy_and_use_consumable 1` to buy and immediately use The High Priestess, which\n\n","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
