{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 17. I'm in the shop with $3, and my goal is to survive this Boss Blind, which I'm estimating will be a hefty 100,000 to 200,000 chips. I've got a decent setup: an Ancient Joker that gives a x1.5 multiplier to Hearts (and with the Smeared Joker, Diamonds count as Hearts), two Hanging Chads that retrigger the first card played twice, a Stuntman giving a decent chip boost, and a Negative 8 Ball that adds a joker slot (but has a chance to give me a Tarot). My base hand is a Flush Level 5, which offers 95 chips and 12 Mult.\n\nI can see a Lusty Joker that adds +3 Mult for Hearts, but it costs $5. I only have $3, so that's out. Neptune, which levels up Straight Flushes, is also available, but since I'm not running a Straight Flush build, I'm not interested. A Standard Pack is too expensive, and I have enough Jokers.\n\nThe shop offers a Reroll, also for $3. With only $3, rerolling is a gamble. It could give me something better, but at the cost of all my money. Do I take the chance?\n\nWait, regarding the Ancient Joker: the text says its suit changes at the end of the round. The last round was the Big Blind, and the Ancient Joker was Spade. In the previous shop, it updated to Hearts. So, for this upcoming Boss Blind, Ancient Joker will be Hearts, which is perfect with the Smeared Joker allowing Diamonds to count as Hearts.\n\nI have no money for anything useful, so I can't buy anything.\n\nSelling a Joker is out of the question since my setup is strong. Neptune is still not useful since I'm not playing Straight Flushes. I don't see any other consumables either.\n\nSo, Option 1 is out. The only action is to `round_select`.\n\nBefore I commit, I'll double-check my Joker order. Right now, it's Ancient, Chad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman, and 8 Ball. I know the Hanging Chads retrigger the first played card used in scoring. With Ancient, the card scores, then the Chads trigger, then the card scores again for its new value, then the Chads trigger again, repeating again. No matter the order, as long as it's the first card that's scored it will retrigger. My Jokers are ideal.\n\nI should also make sure that I don't want to sell 8 Ball. The 8 Ball gives +1 Joker slot but is negative. Selling the 8 Ball gives $5. With the $3, I can't buy Lusty Joker ($5) or Standard Pack ($4), which are both more useful to me than an 8 Ball. Therefore, I can't spend money on the store.\n\nI think I've exhausted all my options. I'm going to `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
