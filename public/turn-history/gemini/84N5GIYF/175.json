{"reasoning":"**Alright, time to focus. I'm in Round 18, the Boss Blind is up, and I need to hit 100,000 chips. I'm currently at 94,191, so the target is 5,809 chips. Three hands to do it. Let's see what we're working with here.**\n\nI've got a decent set up. Ancient Joker on Hearts gives me a 1.5x multiplier to any heart cards played. Two Hanging Chads, so the first card I play gets retriggered, and will score an additional four times. I've got a Stuntman for a solid chip boost. And an 8 Ball that's active. Smeared Joker is disabled this time, which is probably a good thing, now that I think about it, as it won't impact Ancient Joker. The hand in question consists of: a Jack of Spades, 10 of Spades, 6 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, and 3 of Diamonds.\n\nSince I am this close to victory, I'll go with the Ace of Hearts, and a High Card hand.\n\nI'm thinking: base chips for High Card is 15 plus the Stuntman bonus of 300, plus the Ace of Heart's 41 bonus chips, with all five scoring instances. This gives me a decent base, but it’s the multiplier that matters.\n\nI see a possible play to get the goal. If I play the Ace of Hearts, with a High Card hand, the base chip score is 15 + 300 + 41 (AH) = 356 with a 2 mult. Due to the 2 Hanging Chads, the Ace will retrigger 4 times, for a total of 5 scores. The math is: 15 + 300 + 41 (AH) * 5 (retriggers) = 520 chips. With the Ancient Joker, this is: 2 * (1.5 ^ 5) (Ancient Joker triggers) = 15.1875 mult. The final score should be 520 * 15.1875 = ~7,900. Well above what I need.\n\nOkay, I need to consider if there is another higher hand I can play. If I play the pair, of the 6 of Clubs and 6 of Spades, I can do this: 25 (pair level 2 base) + 300 (stuntman) + 41 (AH) * 5 (retriggers) + 6 (6S) + 6 (6C) = 542 chips. The base mult: 3 (pair) * (1.5 ^ 5) (Ancient Joker triggers) = 22.78 mult. This should result in a score of: 542 * 22.78 = 12,347. This is the optimal play.\n\nAfter looking, there are some potential pitfalls. The Smeared Joker being disabled doesn't hinder anything, so that is not an issue. The Hanging Chad only works on the first played card used in the hand that is scoring. It means to trigger Ancient Joker, which must trigger with the first card played in that hand, or any additional card that is triggered on first play.\n\nNow, should I play the Jack of Spades, to benefit from the +4 mult? Playing it first will be higher than the high card setup, so I'll go with that. Let's start with the base math: 15 (base) + 300 (stuntman) + 10 (JS) * 5 (retriggers) = 365, with a mult: 2 (base) + 4 (JS) * 5 (retriggers) = 22. The JS gives a score of 8,030. Well, both work, but I'll stick with AH for stability and to prevent any future issues.\n\nNow I remember, on the last hand, in a similar situation, Ancient Joker only triggered once, because I used a suit which didn't trigger, despite the Smeared Joker being active. It's likely that Smeared Joker was actually disabled in the last round as well, which is an important detail. So Ancient Joker gave its multiplier on the initial score, but not the retriggers, since that isn't included on the card. That is also a safe bet. With this in mind, playing the AH High Card will work.\n\nSo, the play is: High Card (AH, JS, 10S, 6S, 6C)\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,1,2,3,5]"}
