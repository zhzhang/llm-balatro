{"reasoning":"**Current Play Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the `TAROT_PACK` phase, trying to hit those chip thresholds to advance. The Ante is at 4/8, I've got $6, and a decent inventory. I'm rocking some strong Jokers: Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5), two Hanging Chads (retrigger the first card 2x), Smeared Joker (Hearts=Diamonds, which is key), and Stuntman (foil, +300 chips, -2 hand size - not relevant for this decision).\n\nMy hand is: Ace of Spades, 8 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, and Ace of Diamonds.  A good starting point. I've got to maximize that Ancient Joker, which currently boosts Hearts. Smeared Joker means Diamonds also count as Hearts for this purpose.\n\nThe booster pack choices are: The Empress (2 Mult Cards), The Sun (up to 3 Hearts), and Strength (rank +1 on 2 cards).\n\nThe key here is the Sun. I need Hearts, or even better, converting Spades or Clubs to Hearts.  I have two Hanging Chads and if I play a Heart/Diamond as the *first* card, that mult gets triggered five times!  That's a potential 7.59x multiplier on that single card.\n\nSo, Empress and Strength are okay, but not what I need. The Sun is perfect. My plan is to convert the Ace of Spades, 8 of Spades, and Queen of Clubs into Hearts, which is possible because Smeared Joker now allows Diamonds to count as Hearts. Thus, it is necessary to target:\n*   Ace of Spades (Pos 1).\n*   8 of Spades (Pos 2).\n*   Queen of Clubs (Pos 5).\n\nSo, the command is \"select 2 1 2 5\". The positioning is critical here. It's all about maximizing that Ancient Joker synergy! Let's do this.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,2,5]"}
