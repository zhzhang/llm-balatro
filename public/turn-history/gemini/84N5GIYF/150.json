{"reasoning":"**Alright, time to strategize for this boss blind. I'm at Ante 7, Round 15, aiming for 140,000 chips with a current balance of zero. I have 5 hands remaining, with 3 discards available. Thanks to Stuntman, my hand size is 6.**\n\nMy hand composition is: 10 of Spades, 2 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 4 of Spades, Ace of Clubs, and 10 of Clubs. \"The World\" was used to convert a previous hand to Spades, confirming the strategy.\n\nMy joker setup is key: Ancient Joker (Spades multiplier), Hanging Chad (re-triggers), Hanging Chad (re-triggers), Smeared Joker (Spades/Clubs = same suit), Stuntman (+300 chips, -2 hand size), and 8 Ball (negative).\n\nAncient Joker grants a 1.5x multiplier per Spade. Smeared Joker is essential for this Flush strategy, by making Spades and Clubs count as the same suit. The Hanging Chads retrigger the first played card a total of *five* times (1 base + 2 + 2 retriggers). If the first card is a Spade, Ancient Joker will trigger on it five times.\n\nThe plan is a Flush: 10S, 2S, 5S, 4S, AC. Using the Smeared Joker, this counts. The first card has to be a Spade to maximize Ancient Joker's effect. I'll use 10S as the first card.\n\nScoring breakdown: Flush Level 4 is 80 chips and a 10x multiplier. Stuntman gives +300 chips. Card values (10+2+5+4+11) are 32. So the base chip count is 80 + 300 + 32 = 412. Base multiplier is 10.\n\nNow for the Ancient Joker and Hanging Chad interaction: Card 1 (10S) triggers Ancient Joker five times (1 base + 4 retriggers). Cards 2, 3, and 4 each trigger Ancient Joker once. The Ace of Clubs (5) will not trigger because Ancient Joker's effect is specific to Spades and Smeared only helps build the hand, not trigger the joker. Total multiplier is 10 * (1.5^8), which equals about 256.289.  Estimated Chips are 412 * 256.289 = ~105,591.\n\nTarget is 140,000, and this Flush gets me about 105k. I have 5 hands so I will comfortably win the boss in 2 hands.\n\nShould I try to get a fifth spade? I have 4 Spades and 2 Clubs. There are 11 Spades remaining in a 44-card deck. I could discard the two Clubs (AC, 10C) to improve my chances. The probability of drawing at least one Spade is about 44%. Getting a fifth Spade would be an auto win with ~153k chips. However, with five hands and a 105k hand in the bag, the risk isn't worth it.\n\nOrder of Jokers *does* matter here, I'm pretty sure. Stuntman is a chip modifier, so it can be anywhere and not impact the play. Ancient Joker is an \"on scored\" Joker which means it triggers when the cards are being scored, which is where the retriggers also happen. The Hanging Chads retrigger the *cards* which in turn trigger the jokers. This also means that, if a \"mult\" joker was in play, it would ideally be to the left of the x-mult jokers that trigger in step 5, but for this strategy, it does not impact it.\n\nThe position of Ancient Joker doesn't matter since it is \"on scored\". However, I have now realized that the Hanging Chad retiggers are applied after the Ancient Joker is counted during the scoring of the *card*. This is correct because the card's triggers are separate from the card's scoring. So the position of this joker *does not matter.*\n\nLet's double-check the chip count. The base is 80 (Flush) + 300 (Stuntman) = 380, and the card values sum to 32, for a total of 412 chips. Mult is 10 * 1.5^8 = ~256. Total score is ~105k. That checks out.\n\nMy positions for the Flush are 1 (10S), 2\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
