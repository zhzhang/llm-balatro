{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Assessment: Optimizing for the Current State**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Round 9, Ante 5/8, and I'm in a PLANET_PACK. I've got $2, so every decision counts. My primary goal is simple: pick the best planet card to level up my hand, and I'm currently leaning towards Full Houses as a backup to my Flushes.\n\nI have a decent Joker setup: Ancient Joker (Hearts/Diamonds, thanks to Smeared Joker), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, and Stuntman. My hand strategy is Flushes (currently Level 3) but I can easily pivot to Full Houses (Level 4).\n\nLooking at the pack, the options are: Mars (4 of a Kind), Earth (Full House), Saturn (Straight), Venus (Three of a Kind), and Uranus (Two Pair). After my previous performance with Flushes (around 130k), the optimal selection is obvious. Since Jupiter (Flush) isn't an option, Earth (Full House) is the best upgrade, taking it from Level 4 to Level 5. That's a solid +2 Mult and +25 Chips, which is huge this late in the game!\n\nThree of a Kind (Venus) is also available, but the Earth Full House is simply a stronger play, being the hand I'm currently trying to develop.\n\nThe Ancient Joker is currently Hearts and Diamonds, thanks to Smeared Joker, and it's essential to keep this in mind. The upcoming blinds are getting steeper, with Big Blind at 16,500 and The Head (Spades debuffed). However, remember that debuffs don't negate a suit from being valid.\n\nMy selection will be `select 2`, targeting the Earth card in position 2. I'm choosing the `intended_hand_type` of \"full house\" and focusing on the overall strategy. No need for targets, as planet cards apply globally.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
