{"reasoning":"**Strategic Decision Point: Ante 3, Boss Blind Incoming**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 3, Round 5, with \"The Club\" boss blind looming, which significantly nerfs Club cards. Currently, I have $33. My hand has a Full House Level 4 (115 chips, 10 mult) as the top priority play. I'm running five Jokers: Ice Cream (Chips), Ancient Joker (x1.5 Mult on Clubs), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card 2x), Rocket (Economy), and another Hanging Chad. The shop presents Smeared Joker for $7 and a Jumbo Buffoon Pack for $6. The Ancient Joker is set to Clubs.\n\nMy primary thought is the potential synergy with Ancient Joker. The debuff on Clubs due to the boss is a problem, however, Smeared Joker could convert Spades to Clubs. The two Hanging Chads provide double triggers, which is crucial here. If I get the Smeared Joker, I can play Spades and trigger the Ancient Joker.\n\nI need to decide what to do with my Jokers. Rocket is the obvious sell (economy), and it would net me $3 to buy the Smeared Joker. However, the Jumbo Buffoon Pack is a wildcard. It *might* offer a better Joker than Smeared Joker, potentially rendering the decision moot or even providing a better replacement for Ice Cream or Rocket. That's the critical juncture.\n\nBefore I commit to selling Rocket and buying Smeared Joker, I need to check the Jumbo Buffoon Pack. The AI before me had this line of thought and was also deciding between those two. It opened the Celestial Pack, which left this one remaining. So, I need to open the pack.\n\n*   **Action:** `buy_booster`\n*   **Position:** 1 (Jumbo Buffoon Pack)\n*   **Reasoning:** To assess whether the pack provides a superior option before selling a Joker and buying Smeared. The Jumbo pack seems to be the logical move here.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
