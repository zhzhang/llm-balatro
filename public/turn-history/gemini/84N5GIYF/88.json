{"reasoning":"**Boss Blind Strategy: Flush/Full House with Heart Synergy**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for this Boss Blind (Ante 4): I've got $10, and my goal is to maximize the score. My hand is currently set up with a decent base, but it’s all about leveraging these Jokers. Specifically, I'm focusing on either a Flush (level 3) or a Full House (level 4), but the *real* key is that Ancient Joker: (Hearts x1.5).\n\nI've got a Stuntman (-2 hand size, +300 Chips), two Hanging Chads (retriggering the first card 2x) and a Smeared Joker. Since it's still the shop phase and the Ancient Joker changed at the end of the previous round, it's safe to assume it's still Hearts. So, any heart played FIRST in a scored hand will get that multiplier – and the Hanging Chads are going to RETRIGGER that effect. Let's break it down:\n\n*   The *first* Heart played gets: Base Chips, x1.5 (Ancient Joker), and then those Hanging Chads!\n\n*   Hanging Chad 1: x1.5 * 2. This repeats.\n*   Hanging Chad 2: x1.5 * 2. This repeats again.\n\nThat's an approximate 7.59x multiplier just on the first card, before factoring in the rest of the hand and the Stuntman bonus. The Stuntman will get me +300 chips.\n\nMy hand size is reduced to 6 cards. So, I need more Hearts! My immediate priority is to buy the Arcana Pack ($4) and fish for \"The Sun\" card or other useful Tarot cards that could add more hearts to the deck.\n\nAfter that, I'll buy the Celestial Pack ($4) to level up that Flush or Full House, as appropriate. That leaves me with $2, so that's all I'm working with at this time.\n\nThe previous use of Pluto has left me with the Arcana Pack and the Celestial Pack available in the Shop.\n\nTherefore, the first action will be to buy the Arcana pack. The command is `buy_booster 1`.\n\nThe order of the Jokers doesn't matter for independent triggers, nor for this particular use case. Ancient Joker is \"on scored\" for a card, and the Hanging Chads are retriggering the same modifier. It all amounts to the same thing, just a bunch of multiplication, regardless of the order. Stuntman's chip bonus happens separately, so its order is irrelevant.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
