{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Final Ante, Boss Blind Incoming**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's the final ante, 8/8, and we're heading straight into the Boss Blind after this round. My primary goal is to maximize my score for that crucial encounter. I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase, having just picked up the Jumbo Celestial Pack. I'm sitting on a meager $3, so money is definitely tight.\n\nMy joker setup is pretty interesting: the Ancient Joker is locked into a Hearts focus this round. I have *two* Hanging Chads, which I plan to use very effectively, then Smeared Joker which is going to be amazing, it's combining suits, and then Stuntman for foil. The 8 Ball is my potential downside.\n\nI have a decent range of hand levels: Flush is already at Level 4, worth 80 chips with 10 mult. It's the hand I've been relying on – played it 16 times so far. Let's see how the hand order looks for hands. I have Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn, Pluto and Venus.\n\nMy strategy is clearly centered around maximizing Flushes, particularly \"Red\" Flushes, since the Ancient Joker is currently oriented toward hearts and Smeared Joker is in play. The key is to keep leveling up the Flush hand type with Jupiter. That's the most consistent way to boost my scoring potential.\n\nSo, I need to level up Jupiter. I'm selecting that card from position 2. This is an \"action\": \"select\" on \"positions\": [2]. I'm expecting great things!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
