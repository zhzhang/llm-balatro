{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Blind and Joker Synergies**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 3, Round 5, and \"The Club\" Boss Blind is coming up. That's a debuff to Club cards, which is bad, but I think I have a plan to get around that. I have a decent amount of money ($27), and I'm running the BUFFOON\\_PACK phase, but more importantly, I already have a pretty solid joker setup: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, Hanging Chad, Rocket, and another Hanging Chad. The Ancient Joker is set to Clubs, which could be an issue with the upcoming debuff, but it's where the synergy is.\n\nThe pack choices are underwhelming. I have Scholar, Lusty Joker, Shortcut, and Vagabond. Honestly, none of these are game-changing for my current build. My Ancient Joker will give me the x1.5 mult on Club cards. The boss debuffs Clubs, so the cards won't give chips or their own abilities, but the Ancient Joker will still apply. The Ice Cream is starting to decay, and the Hanging Chads are just sitting there, waiting for a strong card to trigger.\n\nThere's a Smeared Joker in the shop for $7, which makes Spades count as Clubs. This changes everything. The Spades won't be debuffed by \"The Club,\" but they *will* count as Clubs for Ancient Joker. If I play a Spade Flush, I'm looking at a massive multiplier. I think that's the best option here.\n\nI have 5/5 jokers and need to make a decision quickly. Let's compare the options. I already spent $6 on the pack, so I should try to make use of it. The Scholar is a potential later-game replacement for Ice Cream, but Ice Cream is better right now. The Vagabond is rare and sells for more ($4), but I need to make sure this is the best move. I don't have enough money to activate Vagabond. Shortcut is niche. Lusty Joker is very weak compared to the current setup.\n\nI can't just take the pack's jokers. I have to sell one of my current jokers. Rocket provides passive income that's too good to lose. Ice Cream is a chip source. My best play is to simply skip this pack. I keep my Jokers and can go straight to the shop for the Smeared Joker.\n\nThe goal is to defeat \"The Club\". My plan is Ancient Joker on Clubs, which is debuffed. Smeared Joker will make Spades into Clubs, so I'll play Spades. They are *not* debuffed by \"The Club\" and still trigger Ancient Joker (x1.5 mult). This seems like the perfect solution.\n\nI should make sure to skip this pack, so I retain my space.\n\nI'm thinking now about selling a Joker to take Vagabond to just make money, but it's not the best use of my Jokers. Rocket sells for $3, while Vagabond sells for $4, so I gain $1. However, Rocket also gives me a passive income and boss payouts. So it's best to skip the pack. I want the shop.\n\nOkay, let's think about this again. With the debuff, my initial thought remains: I can take a Joker from the pack, and then sell the Joker, which will give me money. But Rocket gives me passive income. And selling it and taking Vagabond is bad.\n\nSo, Skip. I am sure now. Skip to the shop.\n\nYes. I am going to skip. I have Smeared Joker in mind for the shop, so the best move is to skip the pack, keeping all my Joker slots available for the Smeared Joker. The shop is more valuable. I have two Hanging Chads, which is also very valuable for card-retriggering.\n\nRight, I'm going to **skip\\_booster**.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
