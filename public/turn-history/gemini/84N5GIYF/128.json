{"reasoning":"**Strategic Round Commencement**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at round 12, with $5 to my name and the BLIND_SELECT stage staring me down. The goal is to clear the 40,000 chip threshold imposed by the Boss blind, \"The Window,\" which unfortunately debuffs Hearts. But, I think I've got this. Let's break it down.\n\nMy hand consists of the following Jokers: Ancient Joker (Clubs suit X1.5 Mult), two Hanging Chads (retrigger the first played card 2 times), Smeared Joker (Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs), Stuntman (Foil, +300 Chips, -2 hand size), and 8 Ball (Negative, +1 Joker slot, Tarot on 8s).\n\nThe key here is synergy. Smeared Joker is a game changer, effectively turning Spades into Clubs. This is huge because Ancient Joker gives a X1.5 multiplier for each scored Club or Spade. The Hanging Chads are going to supercharge this by retriggering the first played card five times total! Additionally, with the Stuntman adding a solid +300 chip bonus, I can offset the potential hand size reduction.\n\nMy strategy is simple: play a Flush of Clubs or Spades. Let's calculate the multiplier. The first card gets triggered 5 times, resulting in a total of 9 Ancient Joker triggers (5 from the first card and 1 each for the remaining four). That means the final multiplier is approximately 38.44. Base chip count on the Flush is 65 chips and x8 multiplier (level 3). Add the 300 chip bonus and low cards and I am set to do more than enough chips to win.\n\nThe Heart debuff seems like a non-issue. I am betting that the debuff applies to *native* Hearts, not those that are *counted* as Hearts (through Smeared Joker). Even if it does apply, a Spade/Club Flush will entirely ignore the debuff.\n\nThe optimal Joker order to maximize is Ancient Joker, Hanging Chad, Hanging Chad, Smeared Joker, Stuntman and 8 Ball.\n\nSo, all that's left is to start the round, and `play_round` is the only sensible command. No positions or hand type are needed for this command according to the available commands list, so the schema should be: action: \"play_round\". I am not going to sell anything or use anything right now, so `play_round` it is. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
