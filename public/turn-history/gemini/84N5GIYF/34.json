{"reasoning":"**The Shop Decision: Balancing Economy and Immediate Power**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, round 3, with $45. My current Joker setup is pretty strong with Ancient, Hanging Chad, Invisible, and Ice Cream, plus the unreliable Idol. The goal is to clear Ante 8, so building for the long game is key.\n\nMy initial thought is to grab \"Rocket\" for its economy. It's a solid, early game choice that'll pay dividends. I have five Jokers, so I need to sell one. The Idol is the obvious candidate – too unreliable with its specific card demands. I *could* also consider selling the Ice Cream (+90 Chips) for a massive +250 Chips from Stuntman, but that -2 hand size is a real drawback for my current strategy. I need to think carefully about that Stuntman/Ice Cream decision. Invisible Joker is cooking, so it's a keeper.\n\nThen I paused. I remember the Invisible Joker is still building after having just hit a boss, so it needs another round to duplicate. I should check the Standard Packs to find Diamonds or 5 of Clubs. If I get the cards I'm looking for, it can massively boost Ancient/Idol.\n\nI have enough money ($45) to make several moves. I can buy Rocket ($6), a Jumbo Pack ($6) and the Planet Merchant voucher ($10). That leaves me with $23 and the Planet Merchant voucher to use at some later time. Stuntman is $7.\n\n*   **Priority 1:** Sell The Idol (weakest Joker).\n*   **Priority 2:** Buy Rocket (early economy scale).\n*   **Priority 3:** Jumbo Standard Pack (card search).\n*   **Consider later:** Stuntman vs. Ice Cream.\n\nOkay, let's start by selling The Idol. Then, I can get Rocket. I can always consider Stuntman after that, but I'm thinking I prefer the economy of Rocket to the immediate chip boost. The Jumbo Pack is tempting to fish for cards, or Planet Merchant.\n\nActually, Stuntman is very strong if I have it with Ice Cream. 340 Chips base is awesome! But the hand size is the deal breaker.\n\nPlan: Sell the Idol. Buy Rocket. I should sell The Idol!\n\n*   **Action 1:** sell_joker, position \\[1]\n*   **Action 2:** buy\\_card, position \\[1] (Rocket).\n\nNow, I'll go back to the shop and see what cards are available.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
