{"reasoning":"**Flush Build Decision Time**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at the final Ante, the Boss Blind is next, and I need to maximize my score. I have $9 to work with. My Joker setup is interesting: Ancient Joker (Hearts-focused), Hanging Chads x2, Smeared Joker (suits matching), Stuntman (Foil), and 8 Ball (Negative). My Flush is already at Level 4.\n\nI'm considering my options. Lusty Joker is tempting for a potential Hearts multiplier, but I'm already at the maximum of 6 Jokers with the 8 Ball. I'd have to sell 8 Ball which would hurt me, so that's out. Neptune for Straight Flush is irrelevant to my current build.\n\nThe key is the Flush. With Ancient Joker x1.5 Mult for Hearts, and Smeared Joker making Hearts and Diamonds effectively the same suit, a \"Red\" Flush is the plan. I have 23 cards for a Red Flush.\n\nNow, do I buy a Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6? It has a good chance of giving me Jupiter, which would level up my Flush to 5. Or, do I get Lusty Joker? No, I need my Jokers. \n\nThe most reliable way to improve my Flush build is the Jumbo Celestial Pack. If I buy it, I'll have $3 left to re-evaluate. The Standard Pack might give me some Hearts, but Jumbo is the better move.\n\nSo, the action is to buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack. I have to think about my Jokers: Ancient Joker (Hearts), Smeared Joker (Hearts/Diamonds). I should collect and prioritize Hearts. Now to buy it and see what I can make.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
