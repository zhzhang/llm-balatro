{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante and Preparing for the Boss**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 7/8, Round 15. The goal is to hit 140,000 chips to beat The Wall. Let's see... my inventory is pretty decent: Ancient Joker, two Hanging Chads, a Smeared Joker, Stuntman (foil), and the 8 Ball. I've got a Strength consumable and The World. Stuntman is going to give me a small hand size, just six cards: 4 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, and a 9 of Diamonds. Five hands, four discards. And zero dollars – typical.\n\nStrategy: My thought is to go for Flushes (Level 4, 80 chips, 10 mult) or Full Houses (Level 7, 190 chips, 16 mult). The Smeared Joker is clutch because it makes Hearts and Diamonds interchangeable with Spades and Clubs.\n\nMy current hand has a red flush potential: four hearts and a diamond. But, I see I also have the 4 of Spades, and the Ancient Joker is on Spades (I assume). Ancient Joker gets a x1.5 multiplier per Spade. I need to make the Ancient Joker work. The Hanging Chad retriggers cards!\n\nRight, so with Smeared Joker, I'm sitting on a Red Flush (8H, 7H, 4H, 3H, 9D). No Spades. But, I have \"The World\"! I can convert up to three cards to Spades. So the move is probably to discard and draw into Spades (or Clubs).\n\nOkay, Smeared Joker... Hearts/Diamonds = Red. Spades/Clubs = Black. I need a Black Flush, so I need Spades (or Clubs thanks to Smeared). I'm sitting on one Black card.\n\nI have The World, which is ideal! If I use \"The World\" on the Hearts and Diamond, and it’s a Black Flush (8S, 7S, 9S, 4H, 3H). But, that's four cards now, not five. I'll need to discard. I'll need to find either another Spade or a Club.\n\nAlright, I need to get the Black Flush. I have 4 discards. I should use them.\n\nThe World... should I use it now, or wait? My goal is 140,000 chips. A simple Red flush won't cut it. To trigger Ancient Joker, I *need* Spades.\n\nI should discard the non-Spades, so I can try for a Black Flush! Okay, so I should discard. I have four discards. I'm going to discard the 8H, 7H, 4H, 3H, 9D. I have a plan!\n\nShould I use \"The World\" before discarding? If I use \"The World\" I have four Spades and then need to draw one Club or Spade, and I keep those three cards. I think it's better to get the four Spades from The World, and then discard. This is efficient.\n\nNow I am calculating the potential. Ancient Joker and Hanging Chad... That's a huge multiplier on the first card. Five triggers of 1.5 multiplier! If all five cards are Spades... that’s 38.4x Mult! (10 mult base). This should get me over the 140,000, easy. The Boss is done!\n\nAlright, it's Spades. I have 1 Spade, I have The World, I need to find Spades/Clubs. Time to discard. Okay, discard. I should discard 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (8H, 7H, 4H, 3H, 9D).\n\nWait, should I use Strength? Nope. Useless. Time to discard! Let's do it!\n\nOkay, let me check the joker order. Ancient Joker is xMult (so it should be after a +Mult joker), but I don't have one.\n\nAlright, let’s do it. Discard. Discard the non-Spades (8H, 7H, 4H, 3H, 9D).\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
