{"reasoning":"**Analysis of Optimal Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Round 2, $39 in the bank. I've got a full house of Jokers, a bunch of freebies in the shop, and the clock is ticking. My immediate focus is on maximizing the scoring potential of this hand and setting myself up for future scaling.\n\nFirst, let's assess the Jokers: Greedy Joker gives +3 Mult on Diamonds, which is nice. The Idol doubles the multiplier on Jacks of Diamonds – this is crucial this round. Ice Cream offers flat chips, which is consistent. Ancient Joker adds 1.5x on Hearts this round, and Hanging Chad retriggers the first card twice. I've also got a Hone voucher in the shop that boosts shiny card frequency, but that's a longer-term play.\n\nThe shop has two free booster packs: a Jumbo Buffoon Pack (Jokers) and a Jumbo Arcana Pack (Tarot cards). The packs are free because of a previous tag. I’m thinking the Arcana pack is the highest priority, for immediate value. Tarot cards have the advantage of taking no inventory, unless I keep them. I don't need to sell a Joker right away.\n\nBefore anything else, I should rearrange the Jokers. The sequence of Joker activation is *critical*. It's a cascading effect: card modifiers, \"On scored\" effects, then retriggers. I need to make sure the +Mult effects trigger before the XMult effects. In this case, Greedy (+3 Mult) should be before The Idol (x2 Mult) and Ancient Joker (x1.5 Mult). Ice Cream is an independent effect, and Hanging Chad is a retriggering joker at the end. The original positions are correct: 1 (Greedy), 2 (The Idol), 3 (Ice Cream), 4 (Ancient), 5 (Hanging Chad).\n\nLet's break down the logic: If the first card played is the Jack of Diamonds: Greedy triggers, then the Idol triggers. Then Hanging Chad retriggers, again Greedy then Idol. This means I MUST keep the Jokers ordered with Greedy before the Idol and Ancient.\n\nSo, I’m going to go with opening the Arcana pack. It's free, has the immediate upside, and doesn't require selling anything yet. So, it's `buy_booster 2`. That's that.\n\nIn short, open Arcana, keep the joker positions. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
