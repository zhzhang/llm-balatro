{"reasoning":"**Current Round Analysis and Action Plan**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4/8, Round 7 – the shopping phase before the Boss Blind. I've got $6, which isn't a ton but enough to make a strategic move. Let's see, my Jokers are Ancient (Hearts x1.5, suit changes at the end of the round), two Hanging Chads (retriggers the first played card twice each), Smeared (Hearts/Diamonds same, Spades/Clubs same), and Stuntman (Foil, +300 Chips, but -2 hand size). I’ve also got no consumables.\n\nI can buy the Celestial Pack for $4, leaving me with $2. Given that I can't reroll ($3) or buy much else, the Celestial Pack looks like the best use of my remaining cash to improve scoring potential. I used \"The Sun\" (from an Arcana Pack) last round to make all my cards Hearts, which really sets up my Jokers.\n\nMy hand levels are Full House (Lvl 4), Flush (Lvl 3), Pair (Lvl 2), and High Card (Lvl 2).\n\nSo, the plan is to buy the Celestial Pack. Specifically, I'll execute the `buy_booster 1` action.\n\nLet me think a bit about Joker order before buying. The Stuntman doesn't really have placement importance for this scoring setup. The Hanging Chads are super interesting because they retrigger the first card. The Ancient Joker gives x1.5 Mult for Hearts. Since I have Smeared Joker, Diamonds also count as Hearts! I can trigger Ancient Joker's x1.5 Mult five times (7.59x). Stuntman will give a huge chip bonus (+300).\n\nSo right now, I have the order: Ancient, Chad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman. After some thought about the rules of scoring, the position of Ancient relative to the Chads won't matter for Ancient's trigger, given the \"on scored\" mechanic (Trigger 3 in the rules). I'm confident with this order.\n\nOkay, let's buy that pack. I'm building out the JSON that the prompt asked for.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
