{"reasoning":"**Immediate Action: Maximize Joker Value**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 3/8, Round 4 (Small Blind done), shop step, $27 in the bank. I have a decent set of Jokers: Ice Cream (chips), Ancient Joker (suit-based mult), Hanging Chad (retrigger), Invisible Joker (about to pay off!), and Rocket (economy). \n\nThe critical thing is that Invisible Joker is at 2/2 and ready to be sold. *This is the highest priority right now.* The Invisible Joker will duplicate a joker when I sell it. \n\nI *must* sell Invisible Joker before buying anything else from the shop. I have 5/5 jokers, so I *need* to free up a slot to trigger the duplication. If I fill the joker slots, I waste the potential. The four possible duplicate targets are all good outcomes. I *really* want Ancient Joker or Hanging Chad to duplicate, but even Ice Cream or Rocket are decent.\n\nAfter selling the Invisible Joker, I'll have $27 + $4 = $31. Now, there are a couple of good buys in the shop: Mega Celestial Pack, Jumbo Arcana Pack, and The Hierophant.\n\nSo, let's just go over this step-by-step. \n\nAction: Sell Invisible Joker.\nPosition: 4.\n\nI'm selling the Invisible Joker right now.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
