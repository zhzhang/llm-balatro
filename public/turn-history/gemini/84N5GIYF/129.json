{"reasoning":"**My Game Plan: A Flush for the Win**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. It's Ante 6, Round 13, and the boss blind. My goal is 40,000 chips. The boss debuffs Hearts, which is relevant given my current hand: Queen of Spades, 2 of Spades, 9 of Hearts (debuffed), 10 of Clubs, King of Diamonds (debuffed), and 9 of Diamonds (debuffed). I've got six cards total because the Stuntman joker reduces my hand size. My jokers are Ancient (Clubs mult), two Hanging Chads, Smeared (Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit), Stuntman (foil), and 8 Ball.\n\nHere's the key: the Smeared Joker. Because of this, Spades and Clubs *both* trigger the Ancient Joker multiplier. So, I need to focus on a Flush of either Spades or Clubs to maximize that Ancient Joker bonus.\n\nCurrently, I have a Queen of Spades, 2 of Spades, and a 10 of Clubs. This gives me 3 of the 5 cards needed for the Flush. The 9 of Hearts, King of Diamonds, and 9 of Diamonds are all debuffed and useless for chip scoring.\n\nThe obvious move is to discard the debuffed cards (9 of Hearts, King of Diamonds, and 9 of Diamonds) to try and draw the extra Spades or Clubs I need. That leaves me with positions 3, 5, and 6 to discard. The debuffed cards also count as Diamonds which are debuffed. Discarding those three cards will let me draw three new cards which is what I want.\n\nI have a decent chance of hitting the remaining two cards needed to make the flush with the discards and 4 discards in total. With 19 remaining Clubs/Spades out of 49 total cards, a Flush is achievable.\n\nJoker order is Ancient, Chad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman, 8 Ball, which is fine since the Ancient Joker triggers with each card. The Hanging Chads will retrigger the first card for maximum Ancient Joker activations and mult. After Stuntman, and I'll have an easy 100k+ chips with the flush.\n\nI need to confirm there are no 8s in my hand. Then I'm ready. I have no 8s.\n\nDiscarding the debuffed cards will give me a better chance of hitting the flush.\n\nI'm ready: Discarding the cards at positions 3, 5, and 6. Now I'll discard these positions for the Flush.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,5,6]"}
