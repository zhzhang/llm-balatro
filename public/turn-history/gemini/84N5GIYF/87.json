{"reasoning":"**Ante 4, Round 7: Optimization Time**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Shop phase, $10 in the bank, and a hand full of possibilities. My primary goal, as always, is to maximize this turn for the best possible outcome in the next blind. I have a solid joker setup: Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5), two Hanging Chads (retrigger the first card), Smeared Joker (suit swaps), and Stuntman. Pluto (High Card level up) is also in play.\n\nMy thought process is this: First, I absolutely need to use Pluto. It levels up High Card and is an instant win, frees up a consumable slot, and puts me one step closer to hitting the big numbers. The Arcana pack is the priority, ideally to get a suit conversion for the Ancient Joker. That's $4, leaving me with $6, and then I can consider the Celestial Pack for another $4, leaving $2.\n\nThe key is in the order of operations. Using Pluto is a no-brainer. The logic is crystal clear - level up High Card, clear the consumable slot, and move on.\n\nThe Joker arrangement is also good. Specifically, I'm thinking about how the Hanging Chads affect the Ancient Joker's trigger. Playing a Heart card in the first slot will activate both Hanging Chads, which will retrigger the Ancient Joker multiple times. All the jokers are positioned correctly.\n\nSo, the plan is locked:\n\n*   **Action**: `use_consumable`\n*   **Positions**: `[1]` (Pluto's position).\n\nThat's the play, optimize, and then on to the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
