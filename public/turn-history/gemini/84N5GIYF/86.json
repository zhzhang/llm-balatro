{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Strategic Joker Management and Booster Acquisition**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4/8, Round 7, Shop Phase, and $10 in the bank. My inventory's looking decent with Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5), two Hanging Chads (retrigger first card 2x), Smeared Joker (Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs), and Stuntman (+300 Chips, -2 Hand Size). I also have Pluto (Level up High Card) and Mercury (Level up Pair) from the High Priestess, which I need to get into play. I'm *really* hoping to find \"The Sun\" from the Arcana pack.\n\nThe shop offers both an Arcana Pack and a Celestial Pack for $4 each, and a reroll for $3. Right now I think the Arcana pack is the way to go to find Hearts cards.\n\nLet's break down the Jokers: if I play a Heart in the first slot with Ancient Joker and the Hanging Chads, that's a massive multiplier (1.5^5 = ~7.59x). Smeared Joker is great for Flushes since Hearts are Diamonds and Stuntman is a nice chip boost. The hand size reduction is the biggest concern.\n\nSo, I need to use the Planet consumables to free up space. My initial thought was to use them, then buy a booster.\n\nOriginally, my plan was: Use Mercury (Level Pair), then Pluto (Level High Card), then buy an Arcana Pack. I should also check if the current suit will be Hearts, which is what Ancient Joker triggers on. Yes, it's Hearts! The Smeared Joker is *crucial* because of this, since Hearts=Diamonds, which means I can get a Flush going easier.\n\nI've got the schema in front of me: `action`: \"use_consumable\"; `positions`: [2] (for Mercury), but the prompt is a little confusing. I should always use both planets before buying the booster to free up space, so the *correct* order is mercury then pluto.\n\nSo, the action will be `use_consumable` with `positions` of `[2]` (for the Mercury consumable, because the positions indicate where in inventory the consumable is). And then `use_consumable` at position `[1]` (for Pluto). Then, buy a pack. I have enough money. I'm going to go with the Arcana pack because the sun is my highest priority.\n\nI'm starting by using Mercury. The current final action is `use_consumable` at position `[2]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
