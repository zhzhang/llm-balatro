{"reasoning":"**My Path to Victory: Flush Strategy Optimization**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 8/8, Round 16. The Big Blind is up next, and I'm sitting on just $1. My goal? Take down that 75,000 chip blind. Luckily, my hand strategy revolves around a Flush (Level 4, 80 chips, 10 Mult) which gives me a solid starting point.\n\nLooking at my Jokers, I have a good mix. Ancient Joker (Spades/Clubs target), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker (Spades/Clubs/Hearts/Diamonds same), Stuntman (+300 chips), and the 8 Ball (negative). The Smeared Joker is interesting - and I need to make sure I understand it correctly. It helps form Flushes across Spades/Clubs, but I need to confirm whether it also changes how my Ancient Joker will work. Okay, re-reading the Smeared Joker. Correct, it helps with *forming* Flushes and Straight Flushes by considering Clubs as Spades, and Hearts as Diamonds. However, for Joker effects based on suits (Ancient Joker), it doesn't change the card's suit itself. The Ancient Joker specifies *Spades*... so only Spades trigger it.\n\nBut, and this is key, I just used The Empress on a Jack of Spades and a 7 of Spades. So I have two Spades that are Mult cards (+4 Mult).\n\nThe Hanging Chads are going to be key. Each retriggers the first card twice which, means, the first card, will get triggered 5 times in total.\n\nHere's the plan. I'm going to play Jack of Spades (Mult) in the first slot:\n\n*   Base Flush (80 chips, 10 Mult) + Stuntman (300 chips).\n*   J of S will trigger 5 times. Each trigger: +10 chips, +4 Mult (Empress), and Ancient Joker's x1.5 Mult.\n*   This will blow past the 75k target.\n\nMy current budget? A measly $1. The shop has items I can't afford: $6, $4, and $6 items. And a $3 reroll. So, I can't buy anything.\n\nOkay, I've checked and double-checked. My last action was using the Tarot Pack in the previous round which put me into the Shop screen. So, the correct action now is to move from the shop to the blind selection. The command for that is `round_select`. It's a simple, elegant play to make. No further action is required. The move from the shop to the next blind should be `round_select`\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
