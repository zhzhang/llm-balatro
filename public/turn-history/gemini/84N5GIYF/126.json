{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Evaluation**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante is 6/8, round 12, and it's the SHOP phase. I've got $5 in the bank. My Joker situation is: Ancient Joker (Clubs multiplier), two Hanging Chads (retrigger), Smeared Joker (suit matching), and Stuntman (chips and hand size penalty). Max Jokers is at 5, but, I have a *Negative* 8 Ball in the shop, which means I can go to 6 total Jokers, and is free.\n\nThe shop also has an Abstract Joker, for $4, which gives +3 Mult per Joker. I also have some Vouchers, Planet Merchant, Hone, Reroll Surplus.\n\nThe Negative Tag is already used, so I know I got a good value 8 Ball. The 8 Ball (Negative) is great; a free Joker slot and a chance at Tarot cards when I play an 8. This is perfect for my build, which seems to revolve around Ancient Joker and Stuntman. The Abstract Joker provides +15 Mult.\n\nGiven that I have a full Joker board, the Negative 8 Ball is an immediate buy, no question. It's free, adds a slot, and potentially gives me Tarot cards.\n\nNow, if I buy the 8 Ball first, I'll have 6 Jokers and the Abstract Joker will then give me +18 Mult. But is that better than saving for interest, or a better Joker in a future shop? It's worth considering.\n\nThe boss is \"The Window\" which debuffs Hearts and I have Ancient Joker set to clubs. I'm seeing 8's in the deck so the 8 Ball has even more value now.\n\nOkay, so the immediate action is clear: `buy_card` at position 1, which is the Negative 8 Ball. It costs $0, so it's an easy win. After that I have $5, and can re-evaluate. I'll buy that 8 Ball, see what the board looks like, then decide on that Abstract Joker or saving for Reroll Surplus, which is at the same price. `action`: \"buy_card\", `positions`: \\[1].\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
