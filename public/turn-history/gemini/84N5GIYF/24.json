{"reasoning":"**Shop Reroll Decision**\n\nOkay, current phase is SHOP, Ante 2, Round 2. I've got $49 and a full Joker lineup: Greedy Joker (Diamonds +3 Multi), The Idol (Jack of Diamonds x2 Multi), Ice Cream (+95 Chips, decaying), Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5 Multi), and Hanging Chad (retriggers the first card twice). I also have the Hone voucher and no consumables. The shop's empty right now – no cards, boosters, or vouchers. Reroll costs $5.\n\nI'm sitting on more than enough money. The interest cap is at $25, so I can comfortably reroll without worry. Ice Cream is temporary and needs to go. My *key* synergy right now is Hanging Chad rerolling the Jack of Diamonds to trigger the x2 Idol and the Greedy Joker. Ancient Joker wants Hearts, which is slightly in conflict, but not a deal breaker.\n\nMy only options are to reroll or go to the round select. Given that the shop is empty, I'll reroll. I've got plenty of money to burn, and a reroll is a cheap way to find some crucial upgrades or planets. This feels like a smart play.\n\nJust a quick sanity check... I *did* buy the Hone voucher last round, so rerolling is absolutely the correct move.\n\nSo, action: `reroll_shop`. No specific hand type in mind, and no estimated chips calculated – just trying to see what the shop throws at me.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
