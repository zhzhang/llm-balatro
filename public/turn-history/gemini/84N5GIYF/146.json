{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Ante 8 Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 14, and I've got a PLANET_PACK from a Meteor Tag skip. Zero dollars, but a decent joker lineup: Ancient Joker (Spade x1.5 Mult), two Hanging Chads (x2), Smeared Joker (Suits), Stuntman (Chips), and 8 Ball (Negative, Tarot generation). I'm also holding Strength and The World consumables, and I'm maxed out at two consumables. The last hand played was a Flush (13 times), currently at Level 4 thanks to the Jupiter pick in the previous turn. Full House is at Level 6.\n\nMy primary goal is to clear Ante 8. The current strategy revolves around Flushes, thanks to the Smeared Joker. This joker makes Flushes incredibly easy to hit. I need to make sure I'm correctly leveraging Ancient Joker, which, I believe, triggers on Spades, *at the end of the round*. I need to be sure which suit the Ancient Joker will actually be. I need to check the metadata.\n\nNow, I'm looking at the pack options: Mercury (Pair) Level 2->3, Earth (Full House) Level 6->7, Neptune (Straight Flush) Level 1->2, and Uranus (Two Pair) Level 1->2. Flush is at Level 4, but Full House is already at Level 6. However, Stuntman's -2 hand size penalty makes Full Houses difficult to play effectively. My hand size is probably 6 or 7, but I need to account for it. Smeared Joker makes hitting Flushes much easier even with a reduced hand size.\n\nConsidering the options, Earth (Full House) gives the biggest immediate stat boost (+2 Mult, +25 chips). Leveling Full House is, generally, better value than focusing on Pair or Two Pair. Straight Flush is too rare to prioritize given my current setup. I've already selected Jupiter to level up my Flush, so now I need to choose the second card from the \"Mega\" pack.\n\nGiven the existing levels, Earth (Full House) is the highest level hand, providing the best scaling. Neptune (Straight Flush) is an option, but much harder to hit reliably. Uranus/Mercury are low impact. Since Full House is Level 6 and I've played it twice already, Earth seems to be the logical backup, secondary hand, or simply the best value pick in this pack.\n\nTherefore, my pack list is now: 1: Mercury, 2: Earth, 3: Neptune, 4: Uranus. Action: I will `select 2`.\n\nJust to recap: Ancient Joker triggers on Spades (Spades and Clubs with Smeared Joker), Hanging Chads will retrigger the first card. Stuntman is providing +300 chips in total (250 + 50 foil). 8 Ball gives a 1 in 4 chance for a tarot card generation on 8s.\n\nSince I'm heading into a Boss Blind (with a large blind size), having higher base stats on any potentially playable hand is critical. Earth improves Full House. Action: I select Earth.\nAction: `select 2`\nTarget: None.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
