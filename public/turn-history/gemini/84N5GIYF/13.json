{"reasoning":"**Strategic Ante Analysis: Play the Big Blind**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante is 2/8, Big Blind is 1,200 chips with a Coupon Tag in play. Currently sitting on $27, which is a good starting point. I've got a solid Joker lineup: Greedy Joker (diamond multiplier), The Idol (x2 multiplier for 3 of diamonds), and Ice Cream (+100 chips). I have two empty Joker slots, but for this situation, the current configuration is optimal.\n\nThe immediate decision is whether to *play* or *skip* the Big Blind. Skipping gives a \"Boss Tag\" which rerolls the upcoming Boss Blind, but the current Boss (1 in 7 cards face down) is manageable. Playing, on the other hand, gives me the $4 base reward plus interest (probably $5), plus the potential hand rewards. Crucially, playing *immediately* triggers the Coupon Tag for the *next* shop.\n\nHere's the key: the Coupon Tag grants free initial cards and booster packs in the next shop. Skipping would mean no shop *before* the Boss, delaying that free value. Playing gives me a shop *before* the Boss, maximizing that free value immediately.\n\nLet's look at the numbers. I need 1,200 chips. Ice Cream provides a quick 100 chip boost. Greedy Joker is going to provide massive value for diamonds. Even a Level 1 hand, like a Flush (Diamonds) should be an easy clear. I can easily do a High Card hand and clear the Big Blind. For example, a 5-card Diamond hand (let's say all Diamonds) would result in approximately: 130 chips * 19 Mult = 2,470 chips - more than enough. Even a high card hand (diamond) is more than enough: (5 + 100) * (1 + 3) = 420 (a few hands like this will clear the blind).\n\nTherefore, there is no real need to skip the big blind. Playing gets me money and the critical access to the shop immediately, capitalizing on the Coupon Tag. Skipping would be strategically inferior in this situation.\n\nMy action: `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
