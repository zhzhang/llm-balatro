{"reasoning":"**Strategic Pack Selection: Maximizing Value in Balatro**\n\nAlright, here's the situation: Mega Celestial Pack, Ante 7/8, Round 14. The goal is to clinch the win and crush that Ante 8 boss. My strategy's currently flush-heavy, but I'm open to adaptation. Flush level is at 3, Ancient Joker keys off Spades (thanks, Smeared Joker!), and my other jokers are working that Spades/Clubs and Hearts/Diamonds spread.\n\nThis pack offers: Mars (Four of a Kind), Neptune (Straight Flush), Earth (Full House), Pluto (High Card), and Venus (Three of a Kind).\n\nI just bought the Mega Celestial Pack to upgrade. I don't see Jupiter (Flush) in this pack. My hand levels are: Flush: 3, Full House: 5, Three of a Kind: 3, High Card: 2, Straight Flush: 1, and Four of a Kind: 1.\n\nGiven my strategy, Ancient Joker + Smeared Joker combo and reliance on Flushes, I'm primarily hunting for Flushes (Spades/Clubs). Since Jupiter (Flush) is a no-show, the next most logical upgrade is the next highest-scoring hand. Earth (Full House) is already at Level 5. Upgrading it to Level 6 is looking good. Venus (Three of a Kind) is at Level 3, and Pluto (High Card) is just a Level 2 backup.\n\nNow, in Balatro, if my primary hand isn't available, I need to evaluate:\n\n1.  Backup high-scoring hands (Full House)\n2.  Easier hands to hit (Three of a Kind, High Card)\n\nEarth provides the most significant raw stat increase (+25 chips, +2 mult). Full House is already a solid fallback. Venus and Pluto are secondary choices. Pluto is useful for scaling if I have enough flat mult from Stuntman/Jokers, but Ancient Joker scales better with base mult from high level hands.\n\nI'm leaning towards Earth (Full House).\n\nAnalyzing again...If I choose Earth, it's Level 5. Is it the best?\n\nFull House: Level 5, Base Chips 140, Base Mult 12.\nThree of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7.\nFlush: Level 3, Base Chips 65, Base Mult 8.\n\nUpgrading Earth: Lvl 5 -> Lvl 6 (165 chips, 14 mult).\nUpgrading Venus: Lvl 3 -> Lvl 4 (90 chips, 9 mult).\nUpgrading Pluto: Lvl 2 -> Lvl 3 (25 chips, 3 mult).\n\nI'm definitely going with Earth. Ancient Joker + Smeared Joker with a Full House that includes Spades/Clubs would be amazing, especially with Hanging Chads!\n\nMy hand size is 6 (Stuntman -2 hand size). A Full House is more difficult than a Flush with this hand size, but a Full House is higher base value than Flush, and since Jupiter isn't available, Earth is the play.\n\nSo, I'm going with Earth, position 3. The JSON I will send is: `{ \"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3] }`\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
