{"reasoning":"**Shopping Spree Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. We're at Ante 4, Round 6, with $24 in the bank. The immediate goal is to maximize the score in this round and optimize for future rounds. I've got a decent setup: two Hanging Chads, an Ancient Joker targeting Diamonds, Smeared Joker (Hearts as Diamonds), and Ice Cream for chip generation. My Flush is level 2, Full House level 4. The plan is to trigger those Hanging Chads and get that Diamond multiplier pumping.\n\nThe shop is showing a few options: Green Joker, Wrathful Joker (Spades +3 Mult), Jumbo Arcana Pack, Celestial Pack, and Reroll Surplus.\n\nFirst things first, I've got to analyze the value of what I want.\n\nThe **Reroll Surplus Voucher** ($10) is a long-term win, reducing reroll costs. Great investment, but first, I need to open the packs.\n\nThe **Jumbo Arcana Pack** ($6) is tempting for potential enhancements, deck manipulation (which would be huge), or even instant cash. It's usually a high-impact purchase.\n\nThe **Celestial Pack** ($4) can always level up my hands, potentially leading to big scores.\n\nI need to see what's in those packs before I commit to the Reroll Surplus, because I might get a Spectral card that makes me want to sell an existing Joker. I have to think about the order of purchases.\n\nSo I've got $24 to spend. Let's see... Reroll Surplus is a great idea, but I want to look at the packs first. If the Arcana Pack has something valuable, I can then make decisions.\n\nHere's the plan: I'm going to start with the **Jumbo Arcana Pack** since it seems to have the highest potential for impact. Then, I'll buy the packs and end with Reroll Surplus.\n\nI need to make sure the Ancient Joker is to the right of any flat chip modifiers if I get them, because those cards will get multiplied. The Hanging Chad retriggers *before* the Ancient Joker triggers.\n\nSo, the action: I'm buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack (Position 1).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
