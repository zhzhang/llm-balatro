{"reasoning":"**Alright, here's the game plan for this Balatro round:**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, Round 5, just finished the Big Blind, and the Boss Blind is next, which is \"The Club\". My current money is $37. I've got a couple of Jokers I need to think about and a shop to browse. The Boss is \"The Club\", which means it debuffs Club cards. However, the shop is showing Smeared Joker. This joker makes Spades count as Clubs.\n\nI need to make a decision here. I have a few Jokers: Ice Cream (provides chips), Ancient Joker (x1.5 Mult on scored Clubs), Hanging Chad (re-triggers), and Rocket (economy). The Boss debuffs Clubs, but Smeared Joker could be huge because it turns Spades into Clubs. If I can get a Spade Flush with Smeared Joker and the Ancient Joker, that's a massive multiplier. Selling Rocket is an option to buy Smeared Joker. It looks like a strong synergy.\n\nDo I *need* Smeared Joker right now, though? Should I ignore Ancient Joker and use the power of Ice Cream and Hanging Chad retriggers? The shop has a Celestial Pack and a Jumbo Buffoon Pack too. Celestial packs are usually a safe bet, and the Jumbo Buffoon pack might have a better Joker for me.\n\nMy goal is still to maximize the score and scale my deck. Since I can get a big boost by playing Spades, I think I need to find the Smeared Joker. The shop looks like it's presenting a very interesting choice.\n\nI think I should prioritize the boosters packs because the shop has Planet Merchant. It makes Planet cards appear more often. Maybe the Jumbo Buffoon Pack is a good idea. I have to see what's in them. I can always just ignore Ancient Joker, and use other suits. I could make a strong flush.\n\nIf I get lucky, a better Joker might make selling Rocket or Ice Cream worth it. Let's see if the Jumbo Buffoon or Celestial packs can replace either. I've just purchased Earth in the previous round, and am looking to boost my hand levels for a Full House or Flush. But with the Planet Merchant, Celestial packs are more reliable.\n\nOkay, let's look at the Boss: \"The Club.\" If I play a Spade Flush, it's 5 cards. With Smeared Joker, Ancient Joker will trigger 5 times, that's 1.5^5 mult. That's a huge multiplier. That's the key. If not, I can play Hearts/Diamonds/Spades. I have to find a better Joker or scale. But now, it looks like it's a no-brainer: I buy the Smeared Joker.\n\nSo, here's my plan: The packs have a choice, so let's see which is better first. But because the Planet Merchant is in play, Celestial is probably a better play. I need to make some decisions, and I want to look at the shop. The value is definitely in the Booster. Buying Smeared Joker is very tempting, but let's see what the boosters have to offer first. So, the play is to buy Celestial, then make the decision to buy Smeared Joker or not.\n\nI think I'll go with the Celestial Pack. It's a solid, reliable play for hand level scaling, especially since I have the Planet Merchant. I have $37, so I can afford it.\n\nOkay, checking the schema... it's `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}`. I need to re-check the shop and boosters. One is the Jumbo Buffoon pack, which gives a choice of 1 out of 4 Jokers. The other is a Celestial pack. Because of the Planet Merchant, Celestial is more likely to give a Planet. But buying the Smeared Joker is still tempting.\n\nNow, wait, let's think about this: if I open the pack and don't find a good Joker, I'm going to want to buy the Smeared Joker. I have to sell something. Rocket seems expendable, since I have $37. It's a small boost, but I'll still have a good bank after the pack. But I can sell after. Boosters seem better to check first. Buying a booster pack takes me to `CHOOSING_CARD`.\n\nOkay, one last check: the Boss is \"The Club\". Smeared Joker is $7, and I can sell Rocket for $3. With Smeared Joker, I'll have a winning combination! It looks like there's no good reason not to buy the pack. Let's stick with Booster 2.\nCelestial Pack (2) is\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
