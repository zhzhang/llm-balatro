{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Mega Celestial Pack**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3/8, Round 4, already completed the Small Blind, and we're at the Planet Pack stage – specifically, the *Mega* Celestial Pack. The Jokers are interesting: Ice Cream for chips, Ancient Joker that multiplies hearts, and two Hanging Chads that will retrigger the first card a total of four times, giving an amazing x1.5 multiplier bonus to hearts. The Rocket Joker's economy is a bonus too. My current money is $23.\n\nThe booster choices are: Earth (Full House), Pluto (High Card), Mercury (Pair), Mars (Four of a Kind), and Jupiter (Flush). The Ancient Joker really nudges me toward hands that use Hearts, so Flushes are a natural fit for this and will get a ton of value from the multiplier. Full House could also work. With the Hanging Chads, it's all about that first card being a heart.\n\nLooking at the hand levels and chip scaling, Full House (Earth) and Flush (Jupiter) are the best candidates. Given that this is a *Mega* pack, I get to choose two. Earth gives +2 Mult, +25 chips, Jupiter gives +2 Mult, +15 chips. A Flush at level 2 is already at 50 chips and 6 mult.\n\nI've been going back and forth, I *think* I should prioritize Jupiter (Flush) because of the Ancient Joker and the hanging chads. I should get a great boost for a first card that is a heart. The hand levels of Full House give more chips, but the multi from the Ancient Joker with a Flush is hard to ignore, and the hanging chads will help with that too.\n\nLet's double check.\n\nOk, last hands played: Full House (9,384 chips) and Flush (11,960 chips). The Flush hand scored a bit higher. Given the setup of the multipliers I can use, I will select Jupiter (Flush) first.\n\nOkay, let's select: `action`: \"select\", `positions`: [5].\n\nNow, the instructions are to only select one at a time because it's a Mega Pack. I'll need to remember to do the other card in the next turn.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
