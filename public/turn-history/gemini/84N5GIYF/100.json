{"reasoning":"**Ante 5, Round 8: Let's Get Paid!**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, Round 8. I'm staring down the Small Blind at 11,000, and the Boss Blind, \"The Head,\" is looming at 22,000, which has the nasty Spades debuff. However, with my Smeared Joker and the Ancient Joker, Spades are functionally Clubs, which is great – but I need to be *mindful* of actually drawing any Spades cards in the Boss round. I'm flush with two Hanging Chads, a Smeared Joker, and an Ancient Joker and the Stuntman joker but the kicker is I only have $2!\n\nI need cash flow. I'm currently at 136,000, well over the requirement. I need to make the money play. Playing the Small Blind gives me $3 base + interest. The Big Blind skip is just ok, doubling $2. However, the Meteor Tag skip is tempting for hand levels, but I have a strong level already. My Polychrome Gold Seal Ace from last round, retriggered by Hanging Chad, can generate a ton of money.\n\nThe Ancient Joker’s suit is likely to change. So, the question is, do I need to preserve my hand or make money? Money is the key. Given my massive score and the desperate need for funds, I'm going to take the small blind. Playing the round gives me a chance to leverage my Gold Seal Ace, get that $3 base reward, plus interest, and see what the shop offers. I'm calling `play_round`. The JSON is `{\"action\": \"play_round\"}`. Let's make some money.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
