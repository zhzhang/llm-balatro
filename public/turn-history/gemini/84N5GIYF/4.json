Ante 1, Big Blind...Hmm, I have a choice: play the blind for immediate cash and a shop, or skip and grab the Investment Tag for $25 after the Boss. I also already have an Uncommon Tag, which means a free Uncommon Joker in the *next* shop.\\n\\nOkay, let's break this down. If I play the blind, I get $4 right now, go to the shop, and get that free Uncommon Joker immediately. I can buy more stuff with the remaining cash, and then face the Boss (who is 'The Hook' for 600 chips).\\n\\nHowever, if I skip, I go straight to the Boss with no Jokers. This is where it gets interesting. The Boss is actually \\\"The Hook\\\" and discards two cards per hand played. Risky, but that Investment Tag is *insane* in early game economy \\u2013 $25 is almost game-breaking at this stage. Then, after the Boss, I get to the shop for the free Joker. Starting Ante 2 with $30+ and an Uncommon Joker? That's a huge advantage, and I already skipped the small blind so the Uncommon Tag is *still* active.\\n\\nGiven the potential for a strong initial economic advantage via the Investment Tag, skipping seems like the correct play. My base deck can likely hit 600 chips; a simple Flush or Full House will get me well over the required score. The Hook is manageable; even with the discards, I can probably get there. And, I do have 4 hands, so the risk of bricking both good hands isn't *that* high.\\n\\nIn this scenario, playing is \\\"safe\\\", but skipping has a higher upside. 600 is low enough that I will take the risk on the skip. So I skip.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: skip_round\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 3]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 0\\nGame Step: BLIND_SELECT\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Uncommon Tag - Shop has a free Uncommon Joker\\n2: Investment Tag - After defeating the Boss Blind, gain $25\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Blind Select Info\\nCurrent Blind: Boss\\nChips Needed: 600\\nBoss Description: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\\nReward: $5\\n# Run Metadata\\n## Hand Levels:\\nThree of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3, Times Played 0\\nTwo Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2, Times Played 0\\nPair: Level 1, Base Chips 10, Base Mult 2, Times Played 0\\nHigh Card: Level 1, Base Chips 5, Base Mult 1, Times Played 0\\nFlush Five: Level 1, Base Chips 160, Base Mult 16, Times Played 0\\nFlush House: Level 1, Base Chips 140, Base Mult 14, Times Played 0\\nFive of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 120, Base Mult 12, Times Played 0\\nStraight Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 100, Base Mult 8, Times Played 0\\nFour of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 60, Base Mult 7, Times Played 0\\nFull House: Level 1, Base Chips 40, Base Mult 4, Times Played 0\\nFlush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4, Times Played 0\\nStraight: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 4, Times Played 0\\n## Last Played Hands: None\\n\\n\\n\\n[MY PREVIOUS ACTION - Turn 3]\\nReasoning: **Analysis of the Initial State in a Poker-Based Strategy Game**\\n\\nOkay, here's the breakdown of the situation. I'm starting in Ante 1/8, Round 0, and it's a Boss Blind. The game state is clearly in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase. My inventory is bare-bones right now \\u2013 no Jokers, no consumables, and no vouchers. However, I have a couple of interesting Tags: an Uncommon Tag, which guarantees a free Uncommon Joker in the next shop, and an Investment Tag, promising $25 after I beat the Boss Blind. Nice. I've got a measly $4 in my pocket and I'm up against \\\"The Hook,\\\" the Boss Blind, which discards two random cards from each hand I play. My goal is to get to 600 chips.\\n\\nSince I am a master of this game, the lack of Small and Big Blinds gives me a moment to pause. I'm at the Boss Blind, which, of course, *must* be played. The only available action, looking at the available choices, is to `play_round`. I can't use a consumable, sell a consumable, rearrange Jokers (because I have none!), or sell a Joker (same reason).\\n\\nSo, the only viable and logical option is to go ahead and begin the round. Given the prompt and the schema I'm responding to, the action is clearly to `play_round`. No need to overthink it. Let's get this show on the road.\\n\\nTherefore, my action: `play_round`.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play_round\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Uncommon Tag - Shop has a free Uncommon Joker\\n2: Investment Tag - After defeating the Boss Blind, gain $25\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Boss.\\nBoss Description: Discards 2 random cards per hand played.\\nChips Needed: 600\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Ace of Spades.

Facing \\\"The Hook,\\\" which is going to randomly discard two cards from my hand after each hand played. I need 600 chips to win, and I'm currently at zero. I have 4 hands remaining and 4 discards total. I have a small amount of money, no Jokers, no consumables.\\n\\nLooking at my hand, I can form a Spade Flush with the Ace, Queen, 5, 4, and 3 of Spades. This Flush is at Level 1, which has a base of 35 chips and a multiplier of 4. The raw chip total of the hand is 33 (11 + 10 + 5 + 4 + 3). Therefore, this will generate (35 + 33) * 4 = 272 chips, about 45% of the total needed.\\n\\nI checked for other potential hands. No straights, high cards, pairs beyond the 4 of Spades and 4 of Hearts (but not enough to be useful), or full houses/three-of-a-kinds. The flush is the obvious play.\\n\\nConsidering the Boss effect, after this play, \\\"The Hook\\\" will discard two cards. The remaining hand will be three cards, as the flush used five. I will then draw seven cards.\\n\\nThe obvious play is to go for the Flush now, gain the 272 chips, then redraw, and hope for a good draw to play the next hand.\\n\\nAction: Play the Flush.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nplay <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Play the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may play up to 5 cards at a time. If you play a hand, you must also respond with the intended hand type you think you are playing, and an estimate of the number of chips you think you will earn from the hand. Use the results of previous hands played to inform your estimate.\\ndiscard <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Discard the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may discard up to 5 cards at a time.\\nrearrange_hand <card1> <card2> ... <cardN> - Rearrange the hand of cards.

  "reasoning": "**Decision Time: Round 1, Let's Play This Right**\n\nOkay, so the goal is 600 chips, and I'm starting with 272. Got three hands to do it. The Hook is a pain, though, discarding two cards after each hand. I've got an Uncommon Tag for a free Joker, and an Investment Tag for some extra cash later, which is nice.\n\nLooking at the hand I was dealt, it's a bit of a mixed bag. I've got a Three of a Kind with the 2s. That's 108 chips, which would bring me up to 380. I would need to get 220 chips, and I still have the annoying \"Hook\" ability to contend with.\n\nA Three of a Kind is okay, I guess. The problem is \"The Hook\". I need to get 220 more chips. If I use it, it removes a bunch of cards from my hand.\n\nI've got a decent Ace and King, but no solid suit connections. I have a shot at a flush but would need to discard and draw. There are some Diamonds in the deck. I could try for a flush.\n\nDiscarding for a Flush, though, seems smarter long-term. A Diamond Flush would be a big payoff, maybe enough to win this in one hit. I have four discards, which gives me some room to maneuver.\n\nI have low cards. I'm going to discard a bunch.\n\nI'll discard the 2 of Spades, 5 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 2 of Clubs, and the 2 of Diamonds.\n\nAfter doing the mental math: *discard* is the way to go.\n\nSo, the play is to discard the trash and try for something better.\n\nLet's discard the 2 Spades, 5 Hearts, 3 Hearts, 2 Clubs, and 2 Diamonds.\n\nThere it is. Discard 5 cards. Ace of Hearts, King of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds are the ones to keep. Fingers crossed for a good draw.\n\n\n"
