{"reasoning":"**Jumbo Spectral Pack is the Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5/8, Round 8, shop phase, $8 in the bank. I've got a solid Joker setup: Ancient Joker (Clubs this round, which I like), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker (Hearts and Diamonds are the same, Spades and Clubs are the same), and Stuntman (+250 chips, +50 foil chips, but -2 hand size).\n\nThe shop's offering Mercury (Pair level-up), Venus (Three of a Kind level-up), a Jumbo Spectral Pack, a Standard Pack, and a Reroll Glut (which is out of reach). I can afford the Jumbo Spectral Pack, a planet, or the Standard Pack, plus a reroll.\n\nMy last hand scored 136k, so I'm looking for a potential power spike or more consistent scoring. Spectral packs are generally a good way to find that. The Jumbo pack is the best choice because I get to pick the card.\n\nLet's see, the Spectral cards could be:\n\n*   *Aura:* Good for boosting a scoring card.\n*   *Hex:* Risky, but could make Ancient or Stuntman Polychrome.\n*   *Immolate:* Good for thinning and money.\n*   *Ankh:* Not ideal for me.\n*   *Wraith:* Might be ok, but I only have $8 right now.\n*   *Sigil:* Might get the right suit for Ancient Joker to trigger.\n*   *Ouija:* Not great with Stuntman's -2 hand size.\n*   *Ectoplasm:* Dangerous with Stuntman's -2 hand size.\n\nI could get a planet or a standard booster, but they are not game-changing, especially since my Ancient Joker already has a decent chance of triggering. Given that my deck has 18 \"Heart-equivalents\" for Ancient Joker, the chance of finding a Spectral card that makes my Ancient Joker trigger much more is my best bet. The jumbo pack lets me pick the card, so I can avoid bad options.\n\nI'm going with the Jumbo Spectral Pack first and see what happens. I can reroll if needed.\n\nThe command will be `buy_booster 1` and my JSON will be: `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`. I checked the command and schema, it should be fine. I'm going for the Jumbo Spectral Pack!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
