{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Maximizing Value**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 3, heading towards the Big Blind. The game state is SHOP. We have $31. My current Joker setup is pretty interesting, and it's time to make a decision about the shop. I've got two Hanging Chads thanks to a lucky Invisible Joker sale, and that Ancient Joker, which is currently Hearts. I'm aiming for huge multipliers.\n\nMy immediate thoughts: Let's see... The Invisible Joker duplicated Hanging Chad. With two of those, any card I play gets retriggered an additional four times on top of the initial score. Combined with Ancient Joker, the first Heart card will get a ~7.6x multiplier. This is the core strategy now.\n\nI see the shop: There's a Mega Celestial Pack for $8, good for leveling hands, a Jumbo Arcana Pack for $6 (could be for enhancements or deck manipulation), The Hierophant for $3, and Gluttonous Joker for $5 (not that useful now with 5/5 jokers and better options).\n\nThe Hierophant is okay, but I'd rather see what's in the packs first. Hand levels are all at 1, so boosting Flush or Full House levels would be really beneficial.\n\nMy plan is to buy the Mega Celestial Pack ($8) and the Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6). I can afford both, so that's what I'll do. $31 - $8 - $6 = $17 left. This is a sound move to scale up! The Ancient Joker just changed suits, too, so I'll keep that in mind for future hands.\n\nBefore I commit to buying, I want to confirm that there's no reason to rearrange Jokers, because in the past I found out that Joker order affects the value. The basic setup is correct; Ancient Joker retriggers after a card scores, while Chad retriggers the retrigger.\n\nThe suit and +Mult on the card matters. The Ancient Joker's x1.5 Multiplier will trigger for each retrigger. The sequence should be: Card scores, Ancient Joker triggers, Hanging Chad retriggers, which in turn retriggers the Ancient Joker. I don't need to reorder the jokers.\n\nI should also check how much money I'm spending, and the exact command. The Mega Celestial Pack is at position 1. Okay, looks good.\n\nOkay, let's execute the buy order. I will first buy the Mega Celestial Pack.\n\nOkay, buy the packs.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
