{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 7/8, Round 13. I'm in the Shop phase, but I've only got a single dollar. Not enough to buy anything from the shop, or even reroll. That's a no-go. No money, no shop, so the obvious choice is to move on to the next round.\n\nNow, let's assess the Jokers. I've got a pretty solid setup. The Ancient Joker, the Hanging Chads x2, the Smeared Joker, Stuntman, and the 8 Ball. Ancient Joker's a multiplier that triggers on Hearts/Diamonds; Smeared Joker lets those suits work together; the Hanging Chads are retriggers; Stuntman gives flat chips, and 8 Ball could offer me some Tarots on 8s.\n\nThe only possible actions right now are: Use a consumable (can't since I'm in the shop phase), sell a consumable (maybe later), rearrange jokers (not now), sell a joker (again, maybe later), or move to round select. Given my lack of funds and the strength of the current Joker setup, I'm definitely going to advance to the next round.\n\nI do need to make sure my Joker order is the best. The Hanging Chads trigger the first card multiple times, and the Ancient Joker multiplies based on Hearts/Diamonds. So I want to make sure I am getting the maximum benefit from the Ancient Joker. Let's make sure the order doesn't impact that. Ah, Ancient Joker's multiplier triggers *during* the card scoring phase (Step 3). That's different. It's not a standard, independent Joker effect; it's a \"when scored\" effect. Hanging Chad retriggers the card during the card scoring phase, so the order doesn't matter as long as Ancient is at the beginning of the sequence. Stuntman is flat chips. So the order is almost irrelevant. My order of Ancient, Chad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman, 8 Ball looks fine.\n\nThe only action I can take is \"round\\_select\".\n\nWait, let me double-check that Ancient Joker again. \"Each played card with Heart suit gives X1.5 Mult when scored.\" That means Hearts and Diamonds, thanks to Smeared Joker. If I play a flush of Hearts/Diamonds, with a Heart/Diamond as the lead card, that first card scores, triggering Ancient Joker, retriggering, scoring, and so on. It's a huge multiplier from a simple flush. Base Mult \\* (1.5^9)! That setup is extremely powerful. No changes needed.\n\nJust to be thorough, does `round_select` need any arguments? Nope. Any other actions? Sell the 8 Ball? No. It's free and negative. The strength or The World? No, those might be useful later.\n\nOkay, I'm ready. Final Action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
