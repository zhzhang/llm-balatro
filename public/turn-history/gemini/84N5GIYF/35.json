{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 3, Round 3. Current ante is 3/8. I've got $42 left after selling that useless Idol last round. I'm in the SHOP phase, so let's see what's on offer. My current Jokers are: Ice Cream (+90 chips), Ancient Joker (Diamond suit, x1.5 Mult), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card 2x), and Invisible Joker (duplication after 1 round). I have one open Joker slot.\n\nThe shop has: a Rocket card ($6), a Stuntman card ($7), a Jumbo Standard Pack ($6), a Standard Pack ($4), and the Planet Merchant voucher ($10).\n\n*   *Rocket*: A great Uncommon economy joker. Pays $1, increasing by $2 per Boss Blind. Seems like a clear choice to purchase now, for future profit.\n*   *Stuntman*: A Rare joker providing a massive +250 chip boost, but with a significant -2 hand size. That's a huge trade-off, making it harder to draw flushes/straights.\n*   *Invisible Joker*: This one is currently on a cooldown period. I'm keeping it for the potential to duplicate something really valuable.\n*   *Ancient Joker*: My primary multiplier. Set to Diamonds now.\n*   *Hanging Chad*: Synergizes well with enhancements and seals, especially when combined with the Ancient Joker.\n\nI have one open joker slot, so buying Rocket is a smart move for long-term economy. I'll buy it immediately, which puts me at 5/5 Jokers. The question is, should I replace Ice Cream with Stuntman? The +250 chips are tempting, but the -2 hand size is a huge negative, especially since I'm relying on flushes for my Ancient Joker. The Ice Cream isn't great, but it's enough chips to push me through to later rounds.\n\nThen I realize I want Invisible Joker to duplicate *something good*. Currently it can hit Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, Hanging Chad, or (if I buy it) Rocket/Stuntman. Duplicating the Ancient Joker or Stuntman would be amazing! So, I need to plan ahead.\n\nFirst step: Buy Rocket.\n\nNow, I'll have: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, Hanging Chad, Invisible Joker, Rocket.\n\nWith $42 left, I could buy a Jumbo Standard Pack to try and find more Diamonds, or I could grab the Planet Merchant voucher to help level up my hand levels. I think I will stick with the initial plan, and skip Stuntman for now, as -2 hand size would be too painful at this stage. Stuntman is probably best left alone for now. I'll stick to the plan of buying Rocket first.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
