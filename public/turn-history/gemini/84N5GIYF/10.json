{"reasoning":"**The Shop Phase: Analyzing, Optimizing, and Executing**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 2, Round 1. I've got a solid foundation: $27, three Jokers – The Idol (x2 Mult on 3 of Diamonds), Greedy Joker (+3 Mult on Diamonds), and Ice Cream (+100 Chips) – plus, I just bought Ice Cream this turn. The shop cards are currently empty, but I have options: a Standard Pack, a Hone Voucher, or a reroll.\n\nMy immediate goal is to optimize for the upcoming round and set myself up for long-term scaling. I'm thinking strategically, weighing my options, and planning for the long game. I'm at a point where I need to make the best decision for the coming turn, but, if I can, it must assist my game for the future.\n\nGiven my starting hand, I need to look at what I need now versus what will help me down the line. I'm weighing costs and benefits. Do I buy the Standard Pack? It's cheap, but will it be useful? Do I reroll and search for more powerful Jokers? Do I buy a Hone Voucher? Hone vouchers help, but they are most useful for the future.\n\nMy initial thought is that the *rearrangement* is the action to take. I'm focused on maximizing my Joker synergy, especially with The Idol being the x2 Mult on the 3 of Diamonds this round.\n\nI've got The Idol in position 1, and Greedy Joker in position 2, and Ice Cream in position 3. The card effects are calculated left to right. Now, let's look at the Joker logic:\n\n1.  Greedy Joker triggers: if I play any Diamonds, I get +3 Mult per Diamond.\n2.  The Idol triggers: if I play a 3 of Diamonds, the entire current Mult gets doubled.\n\nThe critical thing is the order: Greedy, then The Idol is the most important for the 3 of Diamonds! Base Mult (e.g., Flush = 4), then Greedy (+3), then The Idol (x2).\n\nIf I do the opposite order, The Idol (x2), then Greedy (+3): It's still good but not as good.\n\nI need to reorder my Jokers to maximize this synergy. The Idol x2 is best if it occurs after Greedy +3 is applied to the mult.\n\nNow it's time to check my wallet. I've got $27, and I want to maintain over $25 to maximize my interest. Buying a card or rerolling would put me below $25, and I would lose $1 of interest.\n\nRearranging the Jokers, though, is free! No downside. And it sets me up for a better outcome with a single action. I can rearrange Jokers and then buy later, so the best step is rearranging.\n\nMy action will be: `rearrange_jokers 2 1 3`. JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"rearrange_jokers\",\n  \"positions\": [2, 1, 3],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures Greedy Joker triggers first, followed by The Idol's multiplier.\n\nThe `{\"action\": \"rearrange_jokers\", \"positions\": [2, 1, 3]}` action is final. No need to look back, let's rearrange.\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [2,1,3]"}
