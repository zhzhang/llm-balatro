{"reasoning":"**Current Thinking on Round 1**\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. Ante 2, $36 in the bank. I've got The Idol Joker – a potential x2 Mult on the 3 of Diamonds, which changes every round – a single Joker, and nothing else. My goal is to build on that. The shop has Ice Cream, a Buffoon Pack, a Standard Pack, and a Hone Voucher.\n\nFirst thought is *Ice Cream*. +100 chips for $5 is a steal early game, and will smooth things out for a few rounds. The *Buffoon Pack* for $4, though, is the real draw. It's a gamble on getting a consistent Mult Joker or a good Joker to build around The Idol. The *Standard Pack* isn't as tempting right now. The *Hone Voucher* is good for the long-term, but not critical this round. Reroll is an option, but the current shop is solid.\n\nMy initial calculation says buy Ice Cream and the Buffoon Pack. Leaving me with $27.\n\nOkay, let's refine this. Ice Cream provides the immediate power I need to be safe, while Buffoon Pack is high-value for a Joker that complements The Idol.\n\nSo now, a dilemma: *Do I buy Ice Cream first to secure the chips, then the pack, or the other way around?* \n\nSince the prompt is to buy, I'll *buy_booster 1* (Buffoon Pack).\n\nLet me double-check the shop indices: Shop Cards: 1: Ice Cream. Shop Boosters: 1: Buffoon Pack, 2: Standard Pack. Shop Vouchers: 1: Hone.\n\nThen, I'll run one final check on the syntax and schema provided.\n\nThe action is *buy_booster*. The position is 1.\n\nThe schema requires: `\"action\": \"string\", \"positions\": [\"array\", \"null\"], \"intended_hand_type\": [\"string\", \"null\"], \"estimated_chips\": [\"integer\", \"null\"]`\n\nSo it comes down to...\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nFinal check: That's within the budget and it follows the rules.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
