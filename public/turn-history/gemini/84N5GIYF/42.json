{"reasoning":"**The Ante 3 Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the play. Ante 3, $17, and time to strategize. I'm looking at the shop: Cloud 9, Odd Todd, and a reroll. But let's assess the state of play first.\n\nI have some solid Jokers: Ice Cream (+90 chips, although it's decaying), Ancient Joker (x1.5 Mult for Diamonds, which is golden right now), Hanging Chad (retriggers the first card, potentially insane with Ancient Joker), Invisible Joker (needs one more round to duplicate), and Rocket (economy and boss bonus). I also have two good cards: a Polychrome Wild Ace (diamond) and a Holo 8 of Spades.\n\nThe shop offerings are underwhelming: Cloud 9's economy bonus isn't worth it with Rocket and Odd Todd isn't better than Ice Cream. Rerolling is tempting, but with my current setup, it's a gamble. Interest is also tempting at $1 per $5, up to $5.\n\nThe *key* is the Invisible Joker. I need to get it to 2/2 to sell and duplicate one of my other Jokers. I *really* want it to duplicate Ancient Joker or Hanging Chad. To do that, I need to win the *next* round.\n\nSo, the plan: skip the shop, save money, and hit \"round_select\".  My current setup is strong.\n\nI'm playing the Polychrome Wild Ace as the first card with Ancient Joker and Hanging Chad. Polychrome's x1.5, Ancient Joker's x1.5, and Hanging Chad, will trigger Polychrome and Ancient Joker again, three times! It's a game-ender. My Polychrome Wild Ace will score (1.5)^6! The order of the Jokers matters for Independent Jokers, but I don't have any of those right now. The order is fine.\n\nNo need to sell anything, buy anything, or reroll. Focus on the next round. Action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
