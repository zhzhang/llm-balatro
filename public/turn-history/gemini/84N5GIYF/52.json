{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop State**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 3/8, round 4, with $27. I'm in the SHOP phase, which is perfect for a quick assessment. The big blind is coming up, so I need to maximize my chips.\n\nMy jokers are: Ice Cream (+85 chips, decreasing), Ancient Joker (1.5x Mult on a suit), two Hanging Chads (retrigger first card twice), and Rocket (+1$ per round, +2$ per boss). I also have The Hierophant consumable (enhance two cards) and $27.\n\nThe Hierophant is useless *now* because I'm in the shop. I need to be in a round to use it on cards. I'll remember that for next round. Gluttonous Joker (+3 Mult for Clubs) is for sale for $5. It's not worth it - my current setup is much stronger.\n\nRerolling is tempting at $5, but I want to keep $25 for that sweet sweet interest, so I'll pass on that. \n\nRocket is passively generating money, so that's good.\n\nMy core strategy is the Ancient Joker + Hanging Chads combo. One Hanging Chad will retrigger the first card twice, then another for another two retriggers. Combined with a single base trigger that makes 5 triggers for that single card. If that card is the right suit, that's a HUGE mult.\n\nWhat's left to do?\n\n*   Buy Gluttonous Joker? No, it's garbage compared to what I have.\n*   Reroll? Still a no.\n*   Sell anything? Definitely not. Ice Cream's chips are still good, Rocket scales, Chads and Ancient Joker are my power play.\n\nCan I use the Hierophant? No, the text is explicit: it applies to cards *in hand*, not the shop. I need to wait for a round.\n\nThe Ancient Joker's suit *should* have changed from the last round. From Turn 51 I can see the \"Hand\" state cards, 6S, 3S, JH, 3H, KC, 5C, 2C, 3D. The current suit isn't explicitly stated, but it will change at the end of the round.\n\nAlright, I'm ready to move on. Nothing else to do. Time for `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
