{"reasoning":"**Strategic Deep Dive: Ante 8 Decision**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 8, Round 16. Time to maximize my scoring potential. The Big Blind is next, so I need a big play here. Let's see... my current Joker setup is solid: Ancient Joker with Spades multiplier, two Hanging Chads for retriggers, Smeared Joker, Stuntman for chips, and 8 Ball (which I need to keep, even though it's negative, for the extra Joker slot).\n\nThe hand looks promising: Jack of Spades, 7 of Spades, 6 of Clubs, plus a few Diamonds. I need to synergize this with Ancient Joker (Spades/Clubs) and Smeared Joker.\n\nLet's break down the Tarot Pack options. *Judgement* is out; I'm at Joker capacity and don't want to sell a good one for a random. *The Fool* would give me The Sun, which would be Hearts, but Hearts are useless right now because Ancient Joker wants Spades/Clubs. *The Hierophant* is tempting, +30 chips, but *Stuntman* has +300 chips so it's not a huge boost. *The Chariot* gives a x1.5 multiplier, but it's a one-off. It's solid, but not exponential.\n\nThat leaves *The Empress*. This is the key. The Empress enhances two cards to Mult Cards, and my Ancient Joker wants Spades/Clubs. The Jack of Spades and 7 of Spades are the best choices. With the Hanging Chads, this will trigger the x1.5 from Ancient Joker multiple times and amplify the enhanced Mult value. I did the math. My starting mult (10) becomes 14 because of the enhancement (four points plus the starting mult), and this is then multiplied exponentially. It easily hits the necessary score of 75,000 for the Big Blind.\n\nJust to be safe, I am confirming the choice. No risks to selling anything.\n\nEmpress it is. I need to select position 3 (Empress) and target hand positions 1 (Jack of Spades) and 2 (7 of Spades). This is an easy win.\n\nCommand confirmed: `select 3 1 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,1,2]"}
