{"reasoning":"**The Optimization Problem: Ante 7/8 Shop**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the shop in Ante 7, Round 14, just having beaten the Small Blind. My primary goals are to handle the Ante 7 Boss and then Ante 8, and I have exactly $8 to work with. My inventory is looking pretty good: Ancient Joker (now Spades), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, Stuntman (foil), and the 8 Ball, giving me 6/6 Jokers, and Strength and The World, consuming 2/2 consumables. The hand level for Flush is Level 3.\n\nRight now, I'm strongly leaning towards Spade/Club Flushes because the Ancient Joker's suit just changed to Spades, and the Smeared Joker is making Spades and Clubs count the same. Plus, *The World* is now extremely valuable because it turns 3 cards into Spades. This combination is likely going to be very powerful in this round.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Mega Celestial Pack ($8) is the most appealing option; it offers two planet upgrades. The Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6) is good too, but less valuable given my current strategy. The Half Joker and Misprint don't fit my current flush-focused approach.\n\nSince I have exactly $8, the *Mega Celestial Pack* is the clear winner to scale my hand levels, with the caveat I'll have $0 after purchase. Let me quickly double-check that the Ancient Joker's suit is locked in as Spades, which it is. I've got the World which converts to Spades. That's a strong start. Strength is okay, and Jupiter on the Mega Celestial pack could further upgrade Flushes.\n\nI'm holding *The World* and *Strength* for the upcoming rounds. I have space in my inventory for them both. Buying another consumable right now is less useful since packs consume the cards immediately.\n\nSo, *the best immediate action is to buy the Mega Celestial Pack ($8)*. This is the optimal use of my funds.\n\nThe specific command I should use is `buy_booster` with positions `[2]` after several corrections. This is a valid command for the current schema. I am targeting the Mega Celestial pack, which is at position 2 in the shop. After this pack, I'll have $0.\n\nFinal check: The suit of the Ancient Joker has been confirmed as Spades, *The World* is in hand, and the Mega Celestial Pack is a solid value for my $8. I should **buy_booster with position [2]**.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
