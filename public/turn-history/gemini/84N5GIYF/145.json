{"reasoning":"**Strategic Card Pack Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 14 with a 7/8 ante, and this is a PLANET_PACK from a Meteor Tag. The goal is clear: snag two planets. My inventory is looking interesting, with a few Jokers to consider. I have an Ancient Joker, two Hanging Chads, a Smeared Joker which is great for Flushes, and a Stuntman, but that damn Stuntman reduces hand size, and an 8 Ball that's... well, negative. I also have Strength and The World consumables. I'm currently broke, sitting at $0, though.\n\nMy hand levels are: a Level 3 Flush, a Level 6 Full House, and a Level 4 Three of a Kind. Looking at my history, Flushes are my bread and butter – I've played them 13 times with consistently high scores (around 140k). Full Houses are decent, but I've only used them twice.\n\nThe pack choices are: Jupiter (Flush Lvl 3 -> 4), Mercury (Pair Lvl 2 -> 3), Earth (Full House Lvl 6 -> 7), Neptune (Straight Flush Lvl 1 -> 2), and Uranus (Two Pair Lvl 1 -> 2).\n\nGiven my history and the Stuntman's negative impact on hand size, Flushes are the clear winner. The Smeared Joker helps significantly to achieve a Flush. Jupiter, which boosts Flush level, is an obvious pick. The action to take is `select <pack_card_position>`, and Jupiter is at position 1. So, that's the play.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
