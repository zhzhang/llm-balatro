{"reasoning":"**Round 4, Shop Phase: Deck Enhancement Prioritized**\n\nOkay, here we are, Round 4 of the Shop phase with $23 in the bank. I've finished the Small Blind, and the goal is the same as always: maximize score and build a strong economy and deck. My current Joker setup is pretty interesting: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker (currently on Hearts, or just rotated), two Hanging Chads, and Rocket. The Ancient Joker combined with the Hanging Chads has serious potential; that first card can trigger five times!\n\nI've got the Jumbo Arcana Pack in the shop, and I'm definitely leaning towards buying it. It's a high-value pick that could give me some great deck manipulation tools like more Hearts or powerful enhancements. The Hierophant for bonus cards is okay, but I'd prefer to see what I can get from the Arcana Pack first before committing.\n\nThe Ancient Joker is the cornerstone here. The \"suit changes at end of round\" always makes me pause to check if the suit rotated. I'm assuming it's Hearts, or will be by the next time it matters, based on the previous turn's state. I know from past experience how crucial Tarot cards are for getting those Hearts or boosting my key cards.\n\nSo, I’m buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack. That's $6, leaving me with $17. No need to reroll; I have plenty of cash.\n\nNow, let's think about the Joker order, just to be sure. Does the sequence matter? Yes, it does. Ancient Joker is an \"on scored\" effect. If I had a +Mult Joker, I'd want it to the *left* of Ancient Joker. Since I don't have one, this setup seems optimal. The Ice Cream (+chips) will trigger first. After that, the Ancient Joker xMult, and the Hanging Chads will trigger to repeat the sequence four times.\n\nOkay, let's execute the `buy_booster` command, buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack from position 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
