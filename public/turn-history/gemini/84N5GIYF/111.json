{"reasoning":"**My Assessment of the Blind Select Phase**\n\nOkay, Ante 5, Round 10, Blind Select. The current Blind is The Head, meaning all Spade cards are debuffed. I need 22,000 chips. Let's analyze my hand.\n\nI've got a decent Joker setup:\n\n*   Ancient Joker: This wants Spades for the x1.5 Mult.\n*   Two Hanging Chads: Retriggering is always good.\n*   Smeared Joker: Makes Hearts/Diamonds identical, and Spades/Clubs identical.\n*   Stuntman: A chip booster, but reduces hand size - a trade-off.\n\nI also have The Empress consumable (+4 Mult on 2 cards), but I can't use it yet because I haven't seen my hand. I only have $1, which is not relevant in this stage of the game.\n\nHere's the critical observation: The Head *debuffs* Spades, and the Ancient Joker *wants* Spades. However, Smeared Joker means that Clubs and Spades are treated the same for suit-based triggers. Therefore, playing Spades is bad (debuffed and no Ancient Joker trigger) and playing Clubs is *excellent* (counts as Spades for Ancient Joker, but is not debuffed by The Head).\n\nI am in `BLIND_SELECT`, so the available actions are `play_round`, `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, and `sell_joker`. I *cannot* use the consumable just yet, as it requires a hand to target. The only logical move at this point is to enter the Boss Blind.\n\nTherefore, my action is: `play_round`. No additional arguments or information are required for this action in the current phase.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
