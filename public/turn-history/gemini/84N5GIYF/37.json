{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Ante 3/8**\n\nAlright, I'm in the thick of it – Ante 3, with $32 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Ice Cream is decent for now, Ancient Joker is the cornerstone with its Diamond bonus, Hanging Chad offers a second chance, Invisible Joker is primed to duplicate, and Rocket is my economy engine. Hone and Planet Merchant Vouchers are ready to go.\n\nThe Shop presents a Stuntman for $7, which is a hefty +250 chips, but at the cost of a significant -2 hand size. Currently, I'm at the default 8-card hand size. That -2 is a big deal, especially for Flush strategies, which I'm leaning toward with Ancient Joker. I'm hesitant to lock myself into a 6-card hand, even with that chip boost.\n\nThe Ice Cream Joker is currently the weakest long-term, so I'd need to sell it for Stuntman. But, then, if I could copy Stuntman with Invisible Joker, that'd give me a +500 chip boost, but a devastating hand size of 4, which is not at all useful. It makes more sense to keep the Ancient Joker and Hanging Chad as Invisible Joker targets.\n\nLooking at the boosters, Jumbo Standard Pack for $6 looks like the best option right now for playing cards. These are good for finding more Diamonds to boost Ancient Joker this round, or more Seals and Enhancements for Hanging Chad. I might consider a Standard Pack after that, depending on what I get from the Jumbo.\n\nSo, here's the plan: I'm buying the Jumbo Standard Pack. Then, I'll evaluate the contents. Only then, I will look at whether I want to pick up the Standard Pack or if I'm happy to go into the next round. And I'm probably going to skip Stuntman for now. The -2 hand size is just too limiting, especially considering my Ancient Joker-Flush synergy and my desire to let Invisible Joker hit something more valuable.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
