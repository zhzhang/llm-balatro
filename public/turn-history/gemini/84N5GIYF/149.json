{"reasoning":"**Okay, here's the game plan:** I'm in Ante 7, facing the Boss Blind, with 140,000 chips needed. Got some good Jokers: Ancient Joker (Spades), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, Stuntman, and 8 Ball. The hand I've got is 4S, 10H, 2H, AC, 10C, 5D. Chips are at zero right now.\n\nMy goal is to score 140,000 chips. The Ancient Joker is currently Spades, as it changes suit each round. The Smeared Joker means Clubs and Spades are the same suit, and Hearts and Diamonds are also the same. The Ancient Joker gives a 1.5x multiplier for each Spade played.\n\nRight, so with \"The World\" consumable, I can turn three cards into Spades. If I use it on the 10H, 2H, and 5D, they become Spades. That means I’ll have a flush: a 4S, 10S, 2S, AC, 10C, 5S. The 4 Spades will trigger the Ancient Joker, multiplying its value. Hanging Chad retriggers the *first* played card five times (1 base + 4 retriggers). \n\nSo, if I start with a Spade (which I am), it gets the 1.5 multiplier five times (1.5^5 = 7.59). The other Spades (10S, 2S, and 5S) get the 1.5 multiplier once each (1.5^3). Total Ancient Joker multiplier = roughly 25.6x. With a Flush (level 4), that's 80 chips and a 10x multiplier. Stuntman gives 300 chips. The cards’ face values will add more. I’m thinking 400 total chips * 10 mult * 25.6 = 102,400 chips.\n\nOh wait! I have *two* Hanging Chads. Each retriggers the first card *twice*. So, total triggers for the first card are 5 (1 base + 2 Chad1 + 2 Chad2). With a Spade as the first card, that means the Ancient Joker will trigger five times. Ancient Joker's *total* multiplier will be 1.5^8 = 25.62. Chips are approximately 400. Final Score should be 400 * 256 = 102,400. That is not enough!\n\nDoes Smeared Joker allow Ancient Joker to trigger on Clubs? Smeared works for forming Flushes, but the Ancient Joker wants *Spades* explicitly. Let’s assume it only works for Flushes.\n\nI need more Spades. \"The World\" gets me 3 more. If I use it on (10H, 2H, 5D), I have four Spades. So if I play (4S, 10S, 2S, 5S, AC), that's a Flush. The four Spades trigger Ancient. So, Base 10 mult * 1.5^8 = 256 Mult. Chips = roughly 412. So, score should be 412 * 256 = 105,472, which is still not enough.\n\nI need 140,000. I have 5 hands. Two of these hands will win the round easily.\n\nLet’s re-evaluate the plan. Let's use \"The World\" on (10H, 2H, 5D). I could discard the other two cards (AC, 10C), but then I will take the risk of not getting a spade.\n\nLet's check \"The World\" targets: it’s still the same: 10H, 2H, and 5D.\n\nI should verify the Ancient Joker is Spades. It is. It says Spades in the text.\n\nIf the current suit *is* Spades: Use \"The World\" on those cards. They become Spades. I have 4 Spades. Should I play now or discard and hunt? I’ll play. Playing 100k+ is the safer choice.\n\nIf I play (4S, 10S, 2S, 5S, AC), the 4 Spades trigger Ancient Joker. The first card retriggers four times thanks to the Hanging Chads. Total Spades: 5 retriggers from the first card and 3 triggers from the other cards. Mult is\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,2,3,6]"}
