{"reasoning":"**Final Strategy: Heart/Diamond Flush or Full House**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm facing \"The Club\" boss, which means all Club cards are debuffed. My goal is 4000 chips, I'm currently at 780, and I have three hands and three discards remaining. I need to get 3220 more chips.\n\nThe previous hand was a Flush, but only scored 780. Why? Because the Boss \"debuffs\" all Clubs (and, due to the Smeared Joker, Spades too). It took me a little while, but I've figured out that debuffed cards *don't trigger* the \"on-scored\" effects of Jokers like the Ancient Joker (which is set to Clubs, sadly). The Hanging Chads won't re-trigger debuffed cards either.\n\nThe implication is: Ancient Joker is basically useless this round, as are the Hanging Chads. They would have provided a massive multiplier but are deadweight this round. My only hope for chips are the remaining non-debuffed cards and Jokers.\n\nMy best move is to focus on Heart/Diamond Flushes or Full Houses. Smeared Joker lets me combine Hearts and Diamonds for the Flush. The Hanging Chad will, thankfully, re-trigger the first Heart/Diamond I play. Given that a Level 4 Full House base chips and mult, I am going to try and build to that hand.\n\nThe hand I am holding right now has two Hearts/Diamonds, so I need to discard the debuffed cards and try to find a strong hand that can get me to the 3220. Discarding those debuffed cards (Ace of Spades, 3 of Spades, King of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, and 7 of Clubs) is the only way to get a workable hand.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.  **Discard:** The current hand's debuffed cards to increase my chances of drawing Hearts and Diamonds. I'll discard the AS, 3S, KC, JC, 8C, and 7C (which amounts to 5 cards)\n2.  **Play:** Aim for a Full House or Flush of Hearts/Diamonds.\n\nI can make this, I have three hands, I just need to get the right cards. Let's do this.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
