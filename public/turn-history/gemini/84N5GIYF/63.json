{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Fine-Tuning the Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in the shop. I've got a hand of Jokers: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, two Hanging Chads, and Smeared Joker. The Ancient Joker is set to Clubs, and Smeared Joker makes Spades and Clubs the same suit, which is crucial given that the Boss is \"The Club\", where Clubs are debuffed. I only have $23, and the shop is empty. The immediate decision is whether to reroll or proceed to the round selection.\n\nThe core strategy revolves around leveraging the Smeared Joker to play Spades (which count as Clubs) and get the Ancient Joker’s x1.5 multiplier, and then using Hanging Chad to retrigger Ancient Joker for massive scoring. The ideal Joker order is: Ice Cream (for Chips), then the Hanging Chads, then Ancient Joker (multiplicative multiplier), then Smeared Joker.\n\nI need to re-verify the Joker scoring order. Step 3 is where the cards are scored, and that's where \"On scored\" Jokers and retriggers come into play. Ancient Joker (\"Each played card... gives X1.5 Mult when scored\") is an 'On scored' Joker; it’s triggered each time a card is scored. Hanging Chad (\"Retrigger first played card...\") affects the *card scoring* itself.\n\nSo, here's how it would work: the card scores, then Ancient Joker triggers, and then Hanging Chad retriggers the entire scoring sequence. Since the text says: \"Each played card with Club suit gives X1.5 Mult when scored\", it is the source of the mult. Multiple \"On Scored\" Jokers trigger in order. With Hanging Chad, card score -> Ancient Joker -> retrigger -> Ancient Joker.\n\nI am re-analyzing the scoring order. If I had Hanging Chad and Ancient Joker:\n- Card scores.\n- Ancient Joker triggers (x1.5).\n- Hanging Chad retriggers card scoring.\n- Ancient Joker triggers again (x1.5).\n- Hanging Chad retriggers card scoring.\n- Ancient Joker triggers again (x1.5).\n\nSo the positions of Ancient Joker and Hanging Chad *might* matter, but only if the game considers Ancient Joker as part of the \"card scoring\" sequence or an \"Independent Joker\".\n\nI looked at the rules again: \"3) Played cards score left-to-right, each card triggering: ... 'On scored' Jokers (left-to-right for multiple Jokers) ... Retriggers (repeat the above sequence; red seal first, then retriggering Jokers left-to-right)\". It does confirm that Ancient Joker triggers, then the retrigger happens, and the *entire* sequence (including 'On scored' Jokers) repeats.\n\nIf I have two Hanging Chads and one Ancient Joker, card 1 scores:\n- Chips\n- Ancient Joker (x1.5)\n- Hanging Chad 1 (Retrigger)\n    - Chips\n    - Ancient Joker (x1.5)\n- Hanging Chad 2 (Retrigger)\n    - Chips\n    - Ancient Joker (x1.5)\n\nThe position of Ancient Joker relative to Hanging Chad doesn't strictly matter for the *retrigger* of the Ancient Joker effect itself, as long as Ancient Joker is to the left of the other multipliers.\n\nNow for Ice Cream: it adds chips, so where does it trigger? Step 5 says \"'Independent' Jokers activate left-to-right\". Basic jokers usually fall here. If Ice Cream is +80 chips, does it trigger in step 3 or step 5? It's usually step 5. If Ancient Joker (step 3) provides X Mult, and Ice Cream (step 5) provides Chips, the order is: base chips -> card chips -> Ancient Joker Mult -> Ice Cream chips. Chips and Mult are summed separately before being multiplied at the end. The only thing that really matters is that additive mult (+ Mult) should be to the left of multiplicative mult (x Mult).\n\nI don't have any + Mult Jokers right now. I'm relying entirely on the Ancient Joker's x1.5 and the base mult of the hand. The shop is empty. Reroll cost is $5. I have $23. I should probably reroll to find a +Mult Joker or a Planet card.\n\nNow I have to figure out if it is worth rerolling. I have $23. Interest caps at $25 ($5 interest). If I spend $5, I go to $18, which gives $3 interest. The shop currently has nothing. \"The Club\" (Boss) is next. Yes, it's worth rerolling. I need a more\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
