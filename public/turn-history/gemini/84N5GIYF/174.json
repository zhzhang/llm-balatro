{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Final Boss Hand**\n\nOkay, here we go. Final boss, Ante 8/Round 18. Need to hit 100,000 chips. I'm currently at 92,675. That means I need 7,325 more, and I have four hands to do it. The Crimson Heart is the boss, and it disables one random Joker each hand. Looking at my Jokers, the 8 Ball is disabled this hand, so Ancient, Stuntman, and two Hanging Chads are active. Nice. And the Smeared Joker is also active.\n\nLet's look at the cards I have: 2 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds. Need to quickly hit that chip goal. Ancient Joker means Hearts and Diamonds are worth more. Smeared Joker means Hearts and Diamonds are the same suit, effectively giving me a red suit flush. And the Hanging Chads, ugh, those are going to retrigger my initial cards, and those are going to cause absolute chaos. Stuntman gives 300 chips flat which is good.\n\nOkay, I could try for a flush. But a Flush gives 95 chips, 12 mult. That's a good amount. Need to get a high scoring mult value. I could also make a pair.\n\nMy immediate thought is to play a Pair of 2s, given I have two of them. I think I'll use 6(2D), 1(2S) which forms a base hand of 25 chips with 3 mult. Let's start with 2D because it's a red suit. The base will be 325 chips given the Stuntman bonus. The total will be around 7,468 which clears the goal, but to make sure, let's play the 7 of Hearts as well, because it's a higher card.\n\nMaybe I should discard. I could just throw out the non-Hearts/Diamonds and redraw. I have 3 cards that can be discarded. I have 4 hands and 4 discards. I can discard the Spades, Clubs. and fish for better red cards.\n\nLooking at the card list I'm almost certain I'll get more red cards. I just need a high-scoring red card.\n\nHold on. Let's make sure I'm doing this right. The previous calculation did work. The estimated chips will be just what I need. It is better to have an estimated value higher, in the event I draw a terrible hand. I can discard to get the same hand.\n\nLet's just play a pair of 2s. I will put both 2s in there, and the rest as extra chips.\n\nOkay, I'm playing [6, 1, 5, 2, 3] which is [2D, 2S, 9D, 7H, JC].\n\nThe hand will be a Pair of 2s. The intended hand type will be \"pair\". And I'll estimate 18190 chips from the calculation earlier. Seems safe. This will trigger the final win.\n\nLet's do this.\n`{\"action\":\"play\",\"positions\":[6,1,5,2,3],\"intended_hand_type\":\"pair\",\"estimated_chips\":18190}`\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [6,1,5,2,3]"}
