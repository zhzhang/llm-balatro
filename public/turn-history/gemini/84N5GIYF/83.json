{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Dilemma**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 4, Round 7, just beat the Big Blind, and about to hit the Boss blind, which, irritatingly, forces a 0-discard hand. I need 10,000 chips to clear it, which, based on my last hand of 76k, should be trivial, but I'm thinking long term here. My cash flow is at $11, and my current Joker lineup is Ice Cream (+60 chips, decaying), Ancient Joker (currently Hearts, for x1.5 mult), two Hanging Chads (retrigger the first card played twice!), and Smeared Joker (hearts = diamonds, spades = clubs). I also have a Rare Tag from skipping a previous Blind.\n\nIn this shop I have a Stuntman available for free because of the Rare Tag. Stuntman gives +300 Chips, but it costs me -2 hand size. With only a 0-discard hand available, this -2 hand size is a huge drawback when trying to get enough cards of the right suit for Ancient Joker.\n\nHere's the rub: Ice Cream is decent early game, but it decays, and I don't need help hitting the 10,000 threshold for the boss. Stuntman's +300 chips is a significant boost compared to the decaying Ice Cream. The Ancient Joker, the two Hanging Chads, and the Smeared Joker can provide incredible multiplier potential.\n\nTo be clear, my current Jokers are: Ice Cream (+60 and dropping), Ancient Joker (X1.5 for Hearts), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card), and Smeared Joker (making Hearts = Diamonds, Spades = Clubs).\n\nTo buy Stuntman, I need to ditch one. Ice Cream is the obvious choice. So I'll lose +60 chips that decays, but gain a flat +300 with Stuntman.\n\nMy initial thought, with a Rare Tag, is:\n\n1.  Sell Ice Cream.\n2.  Buy Stuntman.\n3.  Evaluate the consumables.\n\nHowever, let's confirm the math.\n\nIf I play a Heart with Ancient Joker, and both Hanging Chads, I get:\n\n*   Base card value (5) + Ace bonus (11) + Stuntman (300) = 316 Chips\n*   Base multiplier: 1\n*   Retrigger x 2 from Chad x 2: (1.5)\\^5 = 7.59x mult.\n*   Score: ~2,400.\n\nI would need a Flush.\n*   Flush Value (65 Chips) + Stuntman (300 Chips) = 365 Chips.\n*   8 x 7.59 = 60.72x Mult\n*   Score: ~22,162.\n\nEven with -2 hand size from Stuntman, I would easily hit 10k with the multiplier from Ancient Joker, the Hanging Chads, and the consistent suit provided by the Smeared Joker.\n\nThe -2 hand size is still annoying, but the consistent suit and Ancient Joker triggers should be enough.\n\nNow, because I have $11, I can also buy a consumable. The choices are The High Priestess ($3), Arcana Pack ($4), or a Celestial Pack ($4). I think I will buy the Arcana Pack first, in case I get The Hermit or Strength to fix the economy or the deck. I could buy the High Priestess for Planets.\n\nSo, the optimal steps seem to be:\n\n1.  Sell Joker 1 (Ice Cream).\n2.  Buy Card 1 (Stuntman).\n3.  Buy Arcana Pack.\n\nSo, here's what I'll do:\n\n1.  Sell Ice Cream.\n2.  Buy Stuntman.\n3.  Buy Arcana Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
