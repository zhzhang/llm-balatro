{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision Making**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 6, round 12. I'm in the SHOP phase. I have $5, and my Joker setup is looking pretty solid. We have the Ancient Joker (Clubs, X1.5), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker (suits are combined), Stuntman (foil, +300 Chips), and the 8 Ball (Negative, Tarot on 8s, +1 Joker slot). Max Jokers is at 6, thanks to the 8 Ball.\n\nThe shop has the Abstract Joker (+3 mult per Joker, currently +18) for $4. We also have a Jumbo Standard Pack and a Jumbo Celestial Pack, both priced at $6, and a Voucher for $10. Not affordable. With $5, my interest will be $1, but I can't afford a re-roll unless I really want to.\n\nMy goal is to reach Ante 8, so I'm aiming for high-scoring hands, specifically Flushes or high-value cards, with Stuntman being crucial for the flat chip bonus. The Ancient Joker is my primary multiplier, and the Chads provide excellent re-triggering potential with the Ancient Joker and Stuntman.\n\nThe Abstract Joker is tempting, especially for +18 mult on the face of it, but buying it would leave me with only $1, and leave me vulnerable. However, let's stop and double-check my slots. Do I have any?\n\nI have six Jokers in play, and the game says I can only have six. The 8 Ball is Negative, which means it adds a slot. Let's make sure I understand how negative cards work again. The 8 Ball says \"+1 Joker slot\" and is \"negative\". Negative cards *add* a Joker slot. Current Max Jokers is 6. Current Jokers is 6. This is important to understand for the rest of the game! Right now I'm full. No Abstract Joker purchase possible.\n\nI'm at capacity, so the Abstract Joker is off the table unless I sell something.\n\nLet's quickly check the reroll situation. It costs $4. That leaves $1. Definitely not worth it unless the shop is atrocious. My best bet is to save.\n\nThe next boss is \"The Window,\" which debuffs Hearts. Smeared Joker ensures my Clubs and Spades are treated equally.\n\nGiven my setup, selling any of my current Jokers feels like a mistake. The Ancient Joker is core, the Chads are insane with re-triggers, Smeared is essential for suit consistency (and the upcoming boss), Stuntman is flat chips, and 8 Ball is a free Joker slot and potentially helpful.\n\nI should verify that it is not worth selling an existing Joker to free up a spot. Selling 8 Ball frees a slot, but the Abstract Joker would only contribute +18 to a mult that's already getting multiplied by the Ancient Joker, and the flat chip bonus of Stuntman. The opportunity cost is too high.\n\nI'll save my money.\n\nAction: I'll select the round.\n\nBut let me verify the math. The Ancient Joker gives an X1.5 multiplier. Smeared Joker and the Ancient Joker means that playing either a Club or Spade will trigger the Ancient Joker multiplier. The Hanging Chad retriggers the first card twice. So, if I start with a Club: (1.5)^5=7.59x mult. Any card after that, gets x1.5. A Flush, is: (1.5)^9=38.4x mult.\n\nLet me double-check the reroll cost. It is $4. I have $5. I am under \"Reroll Surplus\", meaning I'm currently losing $2. Not good to reroll now with only $5. I can't even get anything positive from a re-roll anyway. Best to save.\n\nAgain, I will analyze the shop. Abstract Joker is in position 1. Selling the 8 Ball gives me $5, meaning a $4 Abstract Joker purchase leaves me with $1. If I have more luck in the next round, I might want to buy that. But the cost is the Tarot chance.\n\nDecision: I leave the shop.\n\nOk, now I must double-check the current order of Jokers. Ancient (1), Chad (2), Chad (3), Smeared (4), Stuntman (5), 8 Ball (6). Order matters for certain Jokers. With my setup, Ancient Joker triggers on scoring.\n\nThe Ancient Joker triggers for *each* card played. The Hanging Chad retriggers the first card. I should confirm the math. The order of the first three cards shouldn't matter with their\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
