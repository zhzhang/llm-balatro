{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop phase of Ante 3, Round 3, with $42 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Ice Cream (though it's decaying), Ancient Joker (my diamond multiplier), Hanging Chad (retrigger potential), Invisible Joker (soon to duplicate), and Rocket (economy booster). I just snagged Rocket, which is great. Invisible Joker is one round away from activation.\n\nNow, the shop: Stuntman is tempting (+250 chips, but at the brutal cost of -2 hand size), Jumbo Standard Pack, Standard Pack, and Planet Merchant.\n\nMy initial thought is the Stuntman. It's a massive chip boost that could carry me through, especially since I'm aiming to scale. However, that hand size reduction is a huge penalty, particularly since I'm leaning heavily into Ancient Joker and Flushes. Getting specific suits becomes much harder with a hand size of 6, compared to the base of 8. I'd have to sell Ice Cream to make room for Stuntman. Ice Cream's value is dropping, but the +90 is still decent, and the hand size is essential.\n\nI need to decide: +250 chips at the cost of two cards, or the incrementally decreasing value of Ice Cream, while maintaining the flexibility of the larger hand?\n\nLet's look at the boosters: The Standard Packs could give me enhanced cards or seals, but with Ancient Joker relying on suits, and the next round changing suits, this isn't a high priority. Planet Merchant is interesting as it boosts planet appearances, which aids in long-term scaling of hand levels.\n\nOn a purely chip-based comparison, Stuntman's +250 is vastly superior to Ice Cream's decaying value, but the reduction is a significant consideration. I considered skipping Stuntman in previous thinking, due to the hand size penalty, but perhaps that was a mistake.\n\n$42 in the bank. I want to buy something.\n\nHold on, Invisible Joker! It's one more round until it's ready. If I sell Ice Cream and get Stuntman, Invisible Joker duplicating Stuntman would be a huge chip boost, but the -4 hand size would effectively become unplayable.\n\nWhat if I prioritize Planet Merchant? That looks like the smartest play long-term.\n\nOkay, let's step back and consider the *sequence* of buying. If I spend $10 on Planet Merchant, I'd then have $32. The Jumbo Standard Pack would be $6, and Standard Pack is $4. I could buy both. That's optimal. This also leaves me open to re-evaluating Stuntman after seeing what the booster packs hold.\n\nThe most direct value, after the Rocket purchase, is probably the Voucher and the packs. I need to keep in mind, my primary goal right now is scaling. Planet Merchant is going to help with that.\n\nSo, here's the plan: **Buy the Planet Merchant voucher.** Then, I'll see what the booster packs offer.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
