{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Maximize Free Value**\n\nOkay, here we are in the shop, Round 2, Ante 2/8. I've got $39, a Greedy Joker with Diamond Multiplier, The Idol (Jack of Diamonds X2 Mult), and some Ice Cream for chips. The Coupon Tag is active, which is fantastic – everything is free! My current Joker count is at 3 out of 5 slots.\n\nFirst things first, I need to capitalize on these freebies. The shop has Ancient Joker (Heart suit X1.5 Mult) and Hanging Chad (Retrigger first played card 2x) available for $0. Both are great value, especially since they're free, and the Hanging Chad will be killer with the Diamond cards and Greedy Joker or The Idol. I also have the Jumbo Buffoon and Arcana packs.\n\nI need to decide the order. Since both cards are free, the order doesn't matter too much. I'll take the Ancient Joker (Rare) and Hanging Chad (Common) since I have the space for both and the slots are limited. This will bring me to max Joker slots. I'll get Ancient Joker first.\n\nSo, the action is `buy_card 1`. Then, I'll have to see about selling a Joker to open the Jumbo Buffoon Pack, since I'll be at max jokers. The Coupon Tag is in effect, so I can open the booster pack now and get a Joker. Time to take advantage of these free options!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
