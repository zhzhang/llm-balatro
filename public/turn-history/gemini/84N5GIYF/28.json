{"reasoning":"**My Current Game State Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's take stock of the situation. I'm sitting at $32, which is healthy, and I'll hit the interest cap of $5 at the end of the round if I stay above $25. No immediate needs from the shop, I'm already happy with my current Jokers. The `Crazy Joker` isn't relevant to my current strategy, and `Shoot the Moon` would require replacing something good. Speaking of which, I'm currently running a solid lineup: the multiplicative power of `The Idol` and `Ancient Joker`, which are synergistic, the constant chip generation of `Ice Cream`, the insane utility from the `Hanging Chad`, and the `Invisible Joker`, which is still cooling down.\n\nI've got a Boss Blind coming up next (Ante 2), so I have to finish this round to get the `Invisible Joker` ready to sell. I'm leaning toward selecting the next round, as I don't see anything immediately appealing. The `Crazy Joker` wouldn't be worth it unless I dramatically shift my deck.\n\nI want to make sure I am optimizing my Joker setup. `The Idol` wants Jacks of Diamonds, `Ancient Joker` likes Hearts, and the `Hanging Chad` will re-trigger the first card. I'll need to remember that when placing my cards. I need to make sure to play my best cards as the first card so `Hanging Chad` can retrigger them and any on-scored effects from the Jokers.\n\nI'm thinking about the scoring order, and I remember that the order of the Jokers matters. \"On Scored\" Jokers, like `Idol` and `Ancient Joker`, will trigger first, followed by `Hanging Chad`, and then the independent Jokers. The order of `The Idol` and `Ancient Joker` doesn't strictly matter since they are both multiplicative multipliers, which can be multiplied in any order. If I were to get a +Mult Joker, I would want to have it be the first Joker so it is triggered before the others. With the current lineup, the following order is fine: 1. `Idol` (X2 Mult), 2. `Ice Cream` (+Chips), 3. `Ancient` (X1.5 Mult), 4. `Hanging Chad` (Retrigger), 5. `Invisible` (Utility).\n\nRerolling is still an option, but that would cost me $7 and drop me down to exactly the interest threshold. Is there a chance of seeing anything better? Probably not; it makes more sense to save for the shop *after* the Boss where I might find vouchers or more critical pieces.\n\nI just need to take a quick look to make sure I have all the pieces of information. Oh yeah, `Invisible Joker` needs 2 rounds before it is ready to be sold, so I need to play two more rounds.\n\nDecision: I'll select the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
