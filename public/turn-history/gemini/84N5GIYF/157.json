{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 8, Round 15, and the shop is open. I've got a tight budget of $0. My Joker lineup is: Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5), Hanging Chad (x2), Hanging Chad (x2), Smeared Joker (Hearts/Diamonds, Spades/Clubs), Stuntman (foil, +300 chips), and 8 Ball (negative). I also have \"The Sun\" consumable (convert 3 cards to Hearts).\n\nI can't buy anything in the shop. The \"use_consumable\" action isn't applicable right now because I'm not in a round. I could *sell* \"The Sun\" for $1. I'll need to rearrange the Jokers, sell one, or buy something, but I can't afford any of those actions. I also can't reroll the shop, and I'm forced to do a \"round_select\".\n\nThe Joker order is critical. I'm prioritizing Ancient Joker's xMult effect for Hearts. Hanging Chad will retrigger the first card. I need to make sure the Ancient Joker is positioned to best maximize its output. Normally, an xMult Joker should be last, but in this case, the order doesn't matter for the Ancient Joker, *unless* I had another independent +Mult Joker. Currently, since the Ancient Joker triggers during the \"card scoring\" step (step 3), it applies before the \"independent\" Jokers (step 5). The only step 5 joker I have is the Foil Stuntman, which adds chips.\n\nThe current strategy is to play a Flush of Hearts. I have a Jack of Diamonds with a Mult enhancement. The Hanging Chads will retrigger this card. I have Smeared to convert the diamonds into hearts. Then I'll have the Ancient Joker multiplier for each heart. \n\nThe question is, should I sell the negative 8 Ball? I'm debating whether to sell it for $5. I can buy an Arcana Pack for $4. The 8 Ball provides a chance for Tarots. I'm going for Flushes, so I may not even have 8s in my hand. Selling it gives me $5, which *might* be useful for an Arcana Pack (Jupiter or a suit converter). However, Ante 8 is the final ante, and I need a high score to survive. I don't really *need* the $5. The Arcana pack is a gamble. The safe play is to keep the 8 Ball for potential tarot generation.\n\nMy calculation shows a potential score of roughly 170k, which is enough to win this ante. Ante 8 requires higher scores, and my current build is doing around that much.\n\nNow, concerning the Ancient Joker. The description says \"suit changes at end of round.\" I don't know what it is! Since I'm in the shop, I can't see the suit. I have \"The Sun\" (Hearts) and diamonds that will count as hearts via Smeared. I will find out soon!\n\nMy conclusion: the next action will be `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
