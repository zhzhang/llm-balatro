{"reasoning":"**The Boss Approaches: A Tactical Assessment**\n\nOkay, here we are at the shop phase, Ante 3, Round 5. $15 in the bank, five Jokers fully deployed: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, two Hanging Chads, and Smeared Joker. The Boss, \"The Club,\" is next, which debuffs Clubs. My immediate thought is, how do I make this work?\n\nThe current plan hinges on Smeared Joker. Because of this Joker, playing Spades is the key to bypassing the \"The Club\" debuff while still triggering the Ancient Joker's x1.5 multiplier on Clubs. The two Hanging Chads will trigger the first Spade an additional four times. This creates a very powerful engine!\n\nI see Astronomer in the shop, but it's $8 and I'm full on Jokers. Selling Ice Cream for long-term Astronomer value is tempting, but with the Boss looming, that +80 chips from Ice Cream could be critical for hitting the point threshold. And I'm getting $3 interest next round.\n\nI'm confident in the set up, but let me do a sanity check on the joker sequence. The order affects how the Ancient Joker and Hanging Chads interact. Scoring sequence is: card scores, Ancient Joker triggers (x1.5), then Chads retrigger. Independent Jokers like Ice Cream trigger at the end. I'll make sure to get the most out of the two Hanging Chads, by making sure the Ancient Joker is played first. \n\nSince I'm not running any additive mults right now, the current order of Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, Chads, and Smeared Joker is fine. It's the most optimized configuration given my current resources.\n\nOkay, deep breath. No need to overthink it. The engine is primed, I'm confident in this setup. Let's make sure I'm prepared.\n\nI just need to ensure I proceed to the Boss. My money is good for the next round. Double check of Smeared Joker is still solid, if I play Spades to avoid \"The Club\" debuff, Ancient Joker will still trigger because the Spades count as Clubs.\n\nOne last thought: Should I consider buying Astronomer and selling Smeared Joker after the Boss? I could if I could shop after the Boss, but it looks like I won't. I need Smeared Joker for this run.\n\nOkay, I'm ready. `round_select`. Time to face \"The Club\". Make sure to select the Boss! Last hands were a pair (Big Blind) and then a Full House (Small Blind), so I am going to the Boss.\n\nAlright, here we go. `round_select`... and onto the Boss.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
