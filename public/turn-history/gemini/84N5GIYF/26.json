{"reasoning":"**Strategic Joker Acquisition - SHOP (Ante 2, Round 2)**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in the shop, Ante 2, Round 2, and I've got $46 to work with. My core strategy is all about maximizing scoring and future potential, and this shop visit is key. I've got four Jokers active: The Idol (x2 Mult), Ice Cream (+95 Chips, decaying), Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5 Mult, suit changes end of round), and Hanging Chad (Retrigger first played card 2 times). I'm currently running a lean setup with just four Jokers and my goal is to get the most mileage out of those Jokers. I sold the Greedy Joker last turn, specifically to make room.\n\nThe shop offers a juicy Invisible Joker (duplicates a random Joker after two rounds) for $8, and a Holo Credit Card (+10 Mult, debt allowed) for $4. My gut feeling tells me Invisible Joker is the priority here. Duplicating The Idol, Ancient Joker, or even Hanging Chad would be an absolute game-changer. I have to buy it now, since I can't wait.\n\nSo the plan is: **buy_card 1** - the Invisible Joker. This is clear. The value is obvious, and it's the exact reason I sold the Greedy Joker, so it is consistent with the general strategy.\n\nAfter that, I'll reassess. Should I be greedy and buy the Credit Card? Is it worth it? Probably not; Ice Cream's chips are still strong right now. +10 Mult is good, but I have to weigh its value against the current Joker setup. The Ancient Joker's x1.5 becomes more valuable with a Mult increase, but Hanging Chad is great with my mult multipliers. The Idol is fantastic as it is right now. Ice Cream's chip boost is useful for now. Ultimately, let's keep the Ice Cream. Let's stick to the Invisible Joker.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
