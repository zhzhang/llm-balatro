{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Boss Blind: The Wall**\n\nOkay, here we go. It's Round 14, Ante 7/8. The Boss Blind, \"The Wall,\" is up next at a hefty 140,000 chips. I'm currently at $0, but if I win this, I can buy some cards in the shop. I need to win this round. This is the BLIND_SELECT phase; the only choices I have are `skip_round` (not available on a Boss Blind) and `play_round`. Easy choice.\n\nI've got a killer setup, but let's break it down before I hit that `play_round` button. My hand is:\n\n*   **Jokers:**\n    1.  Ancient Joker (potentially Spades – more on this in a sec!).\n    2.  Two Hanging Chads (retriggers! Good!).\n    3.  Smeared Joker (same color).\n    4.  Stuntman (Foil, so +300 Chips).\n    5.  8 Ball (Negative, but worth it for the extra Joker slot).\n*   **Consumables:**\n    1.  Strength (+1 rank).\n    2.  The World (3 Spades... this is the key!).\n*   **Vouchers:** Grabber, Planet Merchant, Hone, Reroll Surplus.\n*   **Hand Levels:** Flush (Level 4), Full House (Level 7)\n\nMy last Flush score was around 141,000, so I think I can nail this. The Flush is now Level 4, which means I should be clearing this round.\n\nThe main concern is the Ancient Joker. The description says \"suit changes at end of round.\" I skipped the Big Blind. Did the suit change? No. Skipping a blind does not trigger the \"end of round\" effect, so Ancient Joker is likely still on the suit it was in the Small Blind. I need to figure out which suit it is before proceeding.\n\nIn the previous round (Small Blind), I was playing Flushes. Let's assume Ancient Joker is Spades (or Clubs, since I have Smeared Joker). Now I can use \"The World\" if needed to get 3 Spades.\n\nI need to make a decision here. I want to calculate my score.\n\nHere is the Joker order right now: Ancient, Chad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman, 8 Ball.\n\nHere is the scoring: 1) Played cards score. 2) Retriggers. 3) Joker triggers left-to-right. I *think* the Ancient Joker will trigger on each card.\n\nHere is how I see my scoring:\n*   **Flush:** Base 80 Chips, 10 Mult\n*   **Stuntman:** +300 Chips.\n*   **Cards:** ~11 Chips/card. First card has 5 triggers.\n*   **Ancient Joker:** Each Spade X1.5 Mult.\n\nI need to re-arrange Jokers, but I don't need to use consumables yet. I need to see my hand. I am in the Blind Select phase (I don't have a hand yet, just the options).\n\nShould I move the jokers? I don't think it matters, because I have no other Mult jokers and Ancient Joker says, \"Each played card...\" so it triggers the mult for each card.\n\nThe thing is, Ancient Joker is an \"On Scored\" joker (triggers on card scoring). Ideally, I want it to be at the end. I should move Ancient Joker to the right (position 5 or 6) because I may find a +Mult joker. However, since the scoring is X-Mult \"on scored\", it applies to that specific card. I should also move Ancient Joker to the right just in case I get a +Mult joker mid-round. I should move Ancient Joker to the right because I'm not certain if Foil triggers during the card-scoring phase.\n\nI'm getting hung up on the ordering. Let's double-check the rules. The order is:\n*   Played cards score.\n*   Card triggers.\n*   Jokers trigger left-to-right.\n\nOk, so the best place for Ancient is on the right because it's an X-Mult, and I could, potentially, get a Mult on scored joker (I do not have any). The only other joker that matters is the 8 Ball, which is negative, but gives me a joker slot.\n\nHere's the new order:\nChad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman, Ancient, 8 Ball.\n\nAction: `play_round`\n\nNo, let's think. I need\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
