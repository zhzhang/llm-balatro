{"reasoning":"**My Analysis of the Current Game State**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 7, Ante 4/8. I'm in the SHOP step with $13, and the critical goal is to max out chips for the upcoming Boss blind (10,000 chips, 0 discards) while building a winning deck. I have a solid Joker lineup: Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5), two Hanging Chads (retrigger the first card twice each), and Smeared Joker (suits same). I've got one open Joker slot now after selling Ice Cream.\n\nLooking at the shop, the *Stuntman* card is a steal at $0! It offers a whopping +300 chips (Foil edition gives a bonus) but reduces hand size by 2, which is risky for a 0-discard blind. However, with my current setup, I can overcome this - with Ancient Joker and the Hanging Chads, I can retrigger a heart multiple times. Considering this - if I play a Heart Ace in the first position, it triggers 5 times! \n\nThe shop also offers The High Priestess, and Arcana and Celestial packs for $3 and $4, respectively. Given I need to hit 10k in the next round with 0 discards, consistency is key, so Arcana packs might give me some suit conversion cards.\n\nI *need* to buy that Stuntman. Even with the hand size reduction, the chip bonus will cause the score to explode. With Stuntman, and a Flush, I am sure to be in good shape. My plan is: buy Stuntman, then consider the packs.\n\nBased on previous moves, the action should be `buy_card 1` to get Stuntman. Let's do it!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
