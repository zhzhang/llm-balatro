{"reasoning":"**Shop State Analysis and Strategic Planning**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase after that Mega Arcana pack, and things are a bit tight financially. Only got a single dollar to my name. Let's see... my inventory is decent, though. I have my core Jokers: Ancient Joker (Spade), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, and Stuntman (Foil). And that Empress consumable from the pack. The shop offerings are Earth, Devious Joker, Jumbo Standard Pack, and Reroll Glut, but I can't afford any of them, not even a reroll. \n\nThe Boss Blind is The Head. It debuffs Spades. That's a key consideration. I've got the Smeared Joker, which means I can swap Spades and Clubs for suit-based triggers. Right now, the Ancient Joker is set to Spades, so Clubs count as Spades for its effect, but the Head will debuff the Spades cards from triggering the Ancient Joker. My current strategy, as I recall from previous turns, is built around using Clubs (which the Smeared Joker makes count as Spades) to trigger the Ancient Joker while avoiding the Head's debuff.\n\nLooking back at the previous turn (110), I used the Mega Arcana pack and got The Empress, which I then used to enhance two cards. *Wait*, the \"The Fool\" command `select 4 1 6` from turn 110 seems to have been processed, enhancing pos 1 (Ace of Hearts) and pos 6 (2 of Clubs). I also selected The Empress.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how I can use \"The Empress.\" The prompt says `use_consumable`, but I can't target cards because I can't see the hand in the shop state. *But*, if the \"Hand\" *persists*, then maybe I could target those enhanced cards. Looking at available commands, I see `use_consumable`, but again, no \"Hand\" section to target. *Correction*: The prompt clarifies I have no \"Hand\".\n\nOkay, so I can't do anything here in the Shop state. No money, no purchases, and can't use consumables. I *could* sell something to get $2 and reroll. But, no, Ancient Joker and Stuntman are core. Selling Chads or Smeared is suboptimal. Also, I better keep \"The Empress\" for the round to use it on 2 cards in my hand. \n\nSo the only move is `round_select` to the Blind Select screen. It's Ante 5, Round 10. The Big Blind is beaten. The next Blind is the Boss Blind, The Head. But before, let me analyze my Jokers again...\n\n*   Ancient Joker (x1.5 on Spade): Critical for the build. Currently set to Spades.\n*   Hanging Chads (retrigger): These are great for generating extra value from the first card.\n*   Smeared Joker (Club = Spade): Essential to ensure the Ancient Joker triggers during the Boss Blind.\n*   Stuntman (Foil +300 chips): A good source of chips.\n\nSo my order of operations: A Club (or Spade) is played. Ancient Joker triggers, the Chad retriggers the card and triggers the Ancient again. Order of Jokers does not matter.\n\nAlright, the Empress is still sitting in consumables. I can't use it now. The `action` is definitely `round_select`.\n\n*Wait a minute*, let me re-check those shop items again. I could possibly sell The Empress for $1. And then I'll have $2 to Reroll? Still, it's not enough to buy anything. And, more importantly, it's better to keep \"The Empress\" as a consumable to use during the round.\n\nAlso, it is essential to re-emphasize: *The current Game Step* is `SHOP`, not `ROUND`.\n\nOne final check: Ancient Joker will continue as Spades into the Blind. The move is `round_select`. Time to move to the round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
