I'm starting in Ante 1/8, Round 0, and it's a Boss Blind. The game state is clearly in the `BLIND_SELECT` phase. My inventory is bare-bones right now \\u2013 no Jokers, no consumables, and no vouchers. However, I have a couple of interesting Tags: an Uncommon Tag, which guarantees a free Uncommon Joker in the next shop, and an Investment Tag, promising $25 after I beat the Boss Blind. Nice. I've got a measly $4 in my pocket and I'm up against \\\"The Hook,\\\" the Boss Blind, which discards two random cards from each hand I play. My goal is to get to 600 chips.\\n\\nSince I am a master of this game, the lack of Small and Big Blinds gives me a moment to pause. I'm at the Boss Blind, which, of course, *must* be played. The only available action, looking at the available choices, is to `play_round`. I can't use a consumable, sell a consumable, rearrange Jokers (because I have none!), or sell a Joker (same reason).\\n\\nSo, the only viable and logical option is to go ahead and begin the round. Given the prompt and the schema I'm responding to, the action is clearly to `play_round`. No need to overthink it. Let's get this show on the road.\\n\\nTherefore, my action: `play_round`.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play_round\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Uncommon Tag - Shop has a free Uncommon Joker\\n2: Investment Tag - After defeating the Boss Blind, gain $25\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Boss.\\nBoss Description: Discards 2 random cards per hand played.\\nChips Needed: 600\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Ace of Spades.

Facing \\\"The Hook,\\\" which is going to randomly discard two cards from my hand after each hand played. I need 600 chips to win, and I'm currently at zero. I have 4 hands remaining and 4 discards total. I have a small amount of money, no Jokers, no consumables.\\n\\nLooking at my hand, I can form a Spade Flush with the Ace, Queen, 5, 4, and 3 of Spades. This Flush is at Level 1, which has a base of 35 chips and a multiplier of 4. The raw chip total of the hand is 33 (11 + 10 + 5 + 4 + 3). Therefore, this will generate (35 + 33) * 4 = 272 chips, about 45% of the total needed.\\n\\nI checked for other potential hands. No straights, high cards, pairs beyond the 4 of Spades and 4 of Hearts (but not enough to be useful), or full houses/three-of-a-kinds. The flush is the obvious play.\\n\\nConsidering the Boss effect, after this play, \\\"The Hook\\\" will discard two cards. The remaining hand will be three cards, as the flush used five. I will then draw seven cards.\\n\\nThe obvious play is to go for the Flush now, gain the 272 chips, then redraw, and hope for a good draw to play the next hand.\\n\\nAction: Play the Flush. Positions: \\\\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 5 flush 272\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 5]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Uncommon Tag - Shop has a free Uncommon Joker\\n2: Investment Tag - After defeating the Boss Blind, gain $25\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Boss.\\nBoss Description: Discards 2 random cards per hand played.\\nChips Needed: 600\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 2 of Spades.

Got three hands to do it. The Hook is a pain, though, discarding two cards after each hand. I've got an Uncommon Tag for a free Joker, and an Investment Tag for some extra cash later, which is nice.\\n\\nLooking at the hand I was dealt, it's a bit of a mixed bag. I've got a Three of a Kind with the 2s. That's 108 chips, which would bring me up to 380. I would need to get 220 chips, and I still have the annoying \\\"Hook\\\" ability to contend with.\\n\\nA Three of a Kind is okay, I guess. The problem is \\\"The Hook\\\". I need to get 220 more chips. If I use it, it removes a bunch of cards from my hand.\\n\\nI've got a decent Ace and King, but no solid suit connections. I have a shot at a flush but would need to discard and draw. There are some Diamonds in the deck. I could try for a flush.\\n\\nDiscarding for a Flush, though, seems smarter long-term. A Diamond Flush would be a big payoff, maybe enough to win this in one hit. I have four discards, which gives me some room to maneuver.\\n\\nI have low cards. I'm going to discard a bunch.\\n\\nI'll discard the 2 of Spades, 5 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 2 of Clubs, and the 2 of Diamonds.\\n\\nAfter doing the mental math: *discard* is the way to go.\\n\\nSo, the play is to discard the trash and try for something better.\\n\\nLet's discard the 2 Spades, 5 Hearts, 3 Hearts, 2 Clubs, and 2 Diamonds.\\n\\nThere it is. Discard 5 cards. Ace of Hearts, King of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds are the ones to keep. Fingers crossed for a good draw.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4 5\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Uncommon Tag - Shop has a free Uncommon Joker\\n2: Investment Tag - After defeating the Boss Blind, gain $25\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Boss.\\nBoss Description: Discards 2 random cards per hand played.\\nChips Needed: 600\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 7 of Spades.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nplay <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Play the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may play up to 5 cards at a time. If you play a hand, you must also respond with the intended hand type you think you are playing, and an estimate of the number of chips you think you will earn from the hand. Use the results of previous hands played to inform your estimate.\\ndiscard <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Discard the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck.

  "reasoning": "**Analyzing the Optimal Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 1/8, Round 1 against \"The Hook,\" meaning I've got to hit 600 chips to advance, and this boss is going to discard two random cards. I've got a measly 272 chips at the moment, and I need 328 more. I have no jokers or consumables, so I'm playing what I've got. The cards in my hand look promising, I've got a lot of diamonds! Specifically, I've got: 7 of Spades, King of Diamonds, 7 of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds, 4 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds.\n\nMy mind immediately jumps to the possibilities. A flush needs five cards of the same suit, so let's start with a flush. I have seven diamonds, which works well. A flush level 1 gives me 35 chips with a multiplier of 4. I can build a flush with the King, 7, 6, 5, 4 of Diamonds. That'll be 32 chips, so that's a total score of 268 (a multiplier of 4), giving me a total of 540 chips which isn't enough to pass the round.\n\nBut hold on... I also have a straight possibility!  A straight flush would be huge! It gives 100 base chips and an 8 multiplier. The cards needed for a straight flush are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of Diamonds. I have exactly that: the 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of Diamonds. If I play them: 7+6+5+4+3 = 25. The score is (100+25)*8=1000 chips. *That* clearly wins the round.\n\nOkay, let's nail this down. I need a Straight Flush (3-4-5-6-7 of Diamonds). Positions in my hand: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. It's a Straight Flush! The cards are at positions 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Base chips 100, Base Mult 8. Card values add up to 25. Total should be 1000.  Current chips are 272. This wins the round.\n\nOne last glance at the hand - all checks out. I could also use 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of diamonds (positions 8, 7, 6, 5, 4), which would also be a Straight Flush, but the 3-7 option is slightly higher. This also immediately hits the goal - this is the best move.\n\nThe boss effect happens after the play, so it doesn't matter. Now, I'm checking the JSON format, to be precise:\n\nI'm ready to commit to this play:\n*   Action: `play`\n*   Positions: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\n*   Intended Hand Type: `straight flush`\n*   Estimated Chips: `1000`\n\nSo, let me make that JSON object, following all the constraints and schema.  Here it is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"straight flush\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 1000\n}\n```\n\nI triple-checked for validity. This is it.\n\n\n"
