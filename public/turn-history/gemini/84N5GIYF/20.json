{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis: Prioritizing Economic Growth**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Currently, I'm in the shop phase, specifically the Jumbo Arcana Pack. I've got $39 to work with, and a decent spread of Jokers: Greedy Joker (Diamonds +3 Mult), The Idol (Jack of Diamonds x2 Mult), Ice Cream (+95 Chips), Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5 Mult), and Hanging Chad (Retrigger the first card 2x).\n\nI have five Tarot choices to consider. *Strength* is okay (+1 to 2 cards), but I don't see any immediate value without a 10 to turn into a Jack. The *Star* converting 3 cards to Diamonds is tempting for Greedy Joker and future-proofing for The Idol, but I need to balance that with immediate gains. *The Hermit* is the clear standout: Double money, up to $20. I'll get to $59. *Temperance* is lackluster at a $13 payout. *The Hanged Man* deck thinning is always nice, but right now the other options are better.\n\nThe Hermit's value jumps out. It's almost always the play if you have more than $20 in the shop early on. It's essentially free rerolls or shop purchases later on. So, Hermit (+20) would be my immediate pick.\n\nI'm focused on The Hermit. Economic growth is the key here. The Star is nice, but I'm not totally sure the benefit will be here this round. I can always change my mind later.\n\nNow, let's confirm the action. I need to make sure I am doing the correct action. It seems like the only thing required is to choose the card. `select 3`.\n\nI will double check the Jokers' positions, though.\n\nRight now, they're in the order: Greedy, The Idol, Ice Cream, Ancient, Hanging Chad. Scoring: Card, Jokers, Retrigger, Independent Jokers. \"Each Played Card\" type Jokers are evaluated from left to right. +Mult before xMult. This looks good.\n\nSo, the play is still: Select The Hermit (3). Money is key.\n\nMy focus is on long-term survival, so let's stick with the plan.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
