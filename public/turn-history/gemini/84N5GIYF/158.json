{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Ante 8, Final Push**\n\nOkay, so this is it – Ante 8, the final challenge. We're at Round 15, and it's BLIND\\_SELECT time. My current money situation is dire: $0. This is the last leg of the game and I must be conservative.\n\nI've got a strong setup here. Two Hanging Chads, Stuntman for a flat chip bonus, the Smeared Joker (which gives me flexibility with Hearts and Diamonds), and the Ancient Joker for that juicy x1.5 multiplier, which works well with my Flush build (Level 4, 80 chips / 10 mult). The suit on the Ancient Joker is unknown, but \"The Sun\" consumable (Hearts) and the Smeared Joker give me a good chance of it being covered or easily converted.\n\nThe Polychrome tag on the Small Blind skip *looks* tempting, it will be the next shop joker that appears, but realistically, with zero dollars, I can't even *buy* a Joker if it appears. That strategy is too high-variance for this stage. And I need to take the interest on the rewards.\n\nMy plan revolves around playing Flushes. Given the potential of the Ancient Joker, the Hanging Chads, and the flat chip bonus of Stuntman, I should be able to clear the Small Blind (50,000 chips) easily. The big threat is the Boss, \"The Crimson Heart\" (random Joker disabled every hand), but I've got six Jokers, so I should be able to manage.\n\nI need cash! The Small Blind gives me $3. That's money I can use to buy better Jokers in the shop and roll, as well as giving me a buffer for future hands. Therefore, despite the allure of the Polychrome Tag, the play is the consistent, safer option.\n\nI checked the Joker positions – Ancient, Chad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman, 8 Ball – and the order seems reasonable, given the effects. The main thing is to have a good, impactful card in the first slot of the hand, for the Chad triggers.\n\nSo, the action is crystal clear: `play_round`. This is the most logical and efficient move.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"play_round\"}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
