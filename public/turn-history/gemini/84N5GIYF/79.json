{"reasoning":"**Round 6 Shop Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 4, Round 6. I've got $4, and it's shop time. My current joker lineup is Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, two Hanging Chads, and Smeared Joker. Solid setup, leaning into diamond multipliers with the Ancient Joker.\n\nThe shop offers a Green Joker, a Wrathful Joker, and a reroll for $3. With my current hand levels at Flush 3 and Full House 4, and no consumables, I need to make the best decision for building my current build: Diamond focus!\n\nThe Green Joker's a non-starter right now. +1 Mult per hand, but -1 per discard, and it's zero value at the moment. Replacing any of my current jokers with that would be foolish; I need that scale! Similarly, Wrathful Joker's +3 Mult on Spades doesn't synergize with the Ancient Joker's diamond focus, so it's a pass.\n\nRerolling is tempting, but would leave me with only $1, which is practically useless. Saving doesn't give me any interest, so there's no reason to save. The shop has nothing useful for me, no boosters or vouchers.\n\nConsidering I have no money for useful purchases and the offered cards don't fit my build, the optimal move is clear: proceed to the next round.\n\nBefore I go, let's double-check the Joker order. Ice Cream (Chips) doesn't matter for its position. Ancient Joker's x1.5 Multiplier triggers \"when scored.\" Hanging Chads retrigger. Smeared Joker is static. The scoring sequence: cards score (Hanging Chad gives me even more score), Ancient Joker multiplies by x1.5 if Diamond, then independent jokers. After reviewing the rules again, it looks like xMult on Jokers (like the one on Ancient Joker) happens during the card scoring step.\n\nIf I had a +Mult Joker, I would want it to the left of any xMult Jokers. Because the Ancient Joker's effect is tied to the *card* scoring, it doesn't matter what order it is in among the Jokers. So, in my setup, the current joker order doesn't impact the final score.\n\nTherefore, the shop is a dead end with this amount of money. Round select it is!\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
