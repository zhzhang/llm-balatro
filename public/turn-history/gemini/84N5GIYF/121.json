{"reasoning":"**Analysis of Current Game State & Action Selection**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation. Ante 6/8, Round 11, and I'm sitting on a meager $1. The Joker lineup is pretty solid, though: Ancient Joker (Hearts), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, and a Stuntman (Foil). No consumables to speak of. The shop is tempting with The Chariot, Pluto, a Jumbo Buffoon Pack, and Overstock, but everything costs more than I have. Rerolls are also a no-go at $3.\n\nThe real meat of this round is the synergy I've got cooking. The Smeared Joker makes Hearts and Diamonds the same suit, which is crucial. Since I have Ancient Joker, playing a single Heart or Diamond as a \"High Card\" gets me: base chips for High Card + Stuntman chips (300) + card value. Additionally, the base mult from High Card level, and crucially, Ancient Joker triggers five times due to the Hanging Chads, resulting in x1.5^5 multiplier. \n\nGiven the $1 in my pocket and the cost of everything in the shop (including rerolls), selling anything or attempting to manipulate the shop is not feasible right now. The best course of action is clear: move to the next round and hope for better opportunities. The JSON checks out, it's valid, and everything is correctly formatted.\n\nTherefore, the action is `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
