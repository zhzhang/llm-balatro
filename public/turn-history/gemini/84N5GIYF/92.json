{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 4/8, Round 7, and I'm in the shop phase. I have a measly $2 – not ideal, but let's see what we can do. I've got a decent Joker lineup: Ancient Joker, two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, and Stuntman. The shop is completely barren; no cards, no boosters, no vouchers. Reroll is out of the question (costs $3). \n\nMy initial thought is that since I have no money and can't buy anything, I'm stuck with the only option of selecting `round_select` to advance the game.\n\nThe Ancient Joker is currently affecting Hearts. Since I also have the Smeared Joker, Diamonds effectively *are* Hearts. That means any Heart or Diamond I play gets x1.5 multiplier five times due to Ancient Joker and the Hanging Chads (two Chads triggering twice each for a total of four retriggers, plus the original play). Stuntman adds a nice chunk of flat chips (+300). My hand levels are also okay.\n\nI went through the mental gymnastics of checking Joker trigger order. I was initially worried about that, but the system prompt's rule 3 clarified things. The order of the first three Jokers doesn't matter much for the Ancient Joker multiplier, because the retriggers will happen in sequence. It's essentially 5 hits of the x1.5. Smeared Joker is a passive effect.\n\nI re-read the rules of how the system processes game steps. I need to make sure I'm doing the most reasonable action.\n\nEven if I sold a Joker for $2, I'd only have $4, which still wouldn't let me do anything useful. There are no options.\n\nTherefore, the only action I can take is to move to the next round with `round_select`. I'm confirming that this is the only logical step. I'm double-checking the output schema one last time.\n\nSo, the JSON response should be:\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"round_select\",\n    \"positions\": null,\n    \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n    \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
