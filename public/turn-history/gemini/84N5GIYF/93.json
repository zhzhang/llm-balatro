{"reasoning":"**Ready to Play: Leveraging Joker Synergy for a Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm at Ante 4, Round 7 of a Boss Blind (\"The Water,\" I believe, based on the zero-discard constraint).  I've got $2, aiming to hit the 10,000 chip target, with a hand size reduced to 6 cards thanks to Stuntman. My Joker setup is key: Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5 Mult, with suit changes at round end), two Hanging Chads (retriggers), Smeared Joker (Hearts/Diamonds same), and Stuntman (Foil, +300 Chips, -2 hand size).\n\nThe Ancient Joker, currently on Hearts and Diamonds (thanks to Smeared Joker), is the linchpin.  My analysis shows how powerful this is: when a Heart or Diamond card is played, the Hanging Chads will trigger the Ancient Joker, multiplying the multiplier effect *five* times (1.5^5 = 7.59).  Stuntman will give me an additional 300 base chips.  I've run the calculations: even a Full House (Level 4, 115 base chips) could yield an absurdly high score with this setup.  Since I'm forced to play whatever hand I get with 0 discards, this synergy is crucial.\n\nGiven my hand size restriction, and the powerful synergy in my Jokers, I think it's time to play. Since I'm in the BLIND_SELECT phase, the next logical step is to `play_round`.  I don't have any consumables to use, sell or rearrange Jokers. My Joker order looks great; I don't see any need to rearrange it. The total chip calculation looks promising. The Ancient Joker's suit will remain Heart until I play a round.\n\nI'm confident. Time to put this theoretical power into practice.\n\nSo, here's the JSON object for the action I'm going to take:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
