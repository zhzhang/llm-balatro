{"reasoning":"**Analysis of the Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thought process for this shop phase (Ante 3/8, Round 4). I've got $30, and the goal is to optimize my setup for the upcoming Big Blind.\n\nFirst, I assessed my current Jokers: Ice Cream (chip generation), Ancient Joker (x1.5 Mult for Hearts, changing suit end of round), two Hanging Chads (retrigger the first played card), and Rocket (economy boost). My inventory is full, 5/5 Jokers, and empty consumables.\n\nMy current shop options are: Gluttonous Joker (+3 Mult for Clubs), and The Hierophant (Tarot: 2 Bonus cards). I can't immediately use Hierophant (as I'm in the shop, not a hand-playing phase).\n\nI looked at buying Gluttonous Joker, but it is not a good idea for the cost. It's weak and doesn't synergize with my Heart-based Ancient Joker. Selling Ice Cream (for chips) or Rocket (for economy) would be poor trades.\n\nThe Hierophant is a fantastic choice, a permanent deck upgrade (2 Bonus cards). The question is, should I buy it now? It is $3. I considered rerolling the shop for better Jokers, but I don't see any value. Rerolling costs $5.\n\nThe command to use is `buy_card 2` to buy the Hierophant card.\n\nBased on the rules:\n- I must `buy_card 2` as the command. The Hierophant is *not* a consumable that requires cards in hand. I am buying it from the shop. It *becomes* a consumable when I have it in my inventory. Then, when I get a hand, I *can* use it with the `use_consumable` command.\n- The command `buy_and_use_consumable 2` is wrong since it requires a Hand. I don't \"have\" a hand in the Shop.\n\nI have $30, and $25 gives $5 interest. If I buy Hierophant ($3), I get $27, $5 interest. If I buy and re-roll, that's $22, only $4 interest.\n\nMy current joker order looks fine: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, Hanging Chad, Rocket, Hanging Chad.\n- Ancient Joker's position barely matters *if* other Jokers add Mult during card scoring.\n- The Hanging Chads retrigger the *cards* (x1.5 * x1.5).\n\nSo, the optimal move is to purchase The Hierophant, and then move on to the next round. I can wait to see what else the shop offers in future rounds.\n\nI will `buy_card 2`, where 2 is the position of The Hierophant in the Shop.\n\nFinal JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_card\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
