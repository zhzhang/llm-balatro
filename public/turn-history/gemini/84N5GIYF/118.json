Round 11, The Head boss blind. Goal: 22,000 chips. I'm currently at 14,336, meaning I need to find approximately 7,664 chips. I only have three hands remaining, and three discards. The boss blind debuffs all Spades, and thanks to the Smeared Joker, Clubs are also counted as Spades, effectively debuffing them too.\\n\\nI've got a decent set of Jokers: Ancient Joker (useless this round, unfortunately, as it's Spades), Hanging Chad (x2 Retrigger), Hanging Chad (x2 Retrigger), Smeared Joker (suit combination, which is important), and Stuntman (+300 chips and reduced hand size which doesn't matter much here).\\n\\nMy initial hand consists of: 7 of Spades (debuffed), 9 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs (debuffed), 3 of Clubs (debuffed), and 4 of Diamonds. The only playable cards are 9 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, and 4 of Diamonds. The Smeared Joker means that these are all considered the same suit so I have flush potential, which is important. The Stuntman adds a flat +300.\\n\\nI decided to play the 9 of Hearts at position 2 (since it's a good single card that is not debuffed). The Hanging Chads retrigger this card (2 + 2 = 5 total triggers). So, High Card (level 2) is a base of 15 * 2 Mult = 30. The card itself contributes 9 chips * 5 triggers = 45. Add in the Stuntman's +300, and I'm looking at (15 + 45 + 300) * 2 = 720 chips. I'm at 15,056 now, needing about 7,000 more.\\n\\nNow, I'm at a crossroads. Discarding the debuffed cards (7S, 9C, 3C) is the most logical choice. I have 3 discards left, and 3 hands. If I play the worst now, I'll be in a better situation on the next two. The goal is 22k. I need 8k. Stuntman gives 300 chip. If I play a flush it's worth (65 + ~30 + 300) * 8 Mult = 395 * 8 = 3,160. That's at least 2 flush plays. Two flushes would score ~6,320. 14,336 + 6,320 = 20,656. Close, but not quite. I think Pair or Three of a Kind with the Hanging Chads would do better. So discard.\\n\\nI triple-checked the debuffed cards and the Ancient Joker, confirming they are useless this round. Stuntman is +300. Discarding is the play. Let's do it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 4 5\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 117]\\nAnte: 5/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ancient Joker.

Ante 5/8, Boss \\\"The Head\\\", debuffing Spades, which thanks to Smeared Joker means Clubs are also useless. I need 22,000 chips; I'm currently at 14,336, leaving me 7,664 to grab. Only three hands remain and I have two discards. My hand is a bit of a mess: a debuffed 2 of Spades and debuffed Ace of Clubs, plus a Jack, 9, and 8 of Hearts, and a 4 of Diamonds. The Ancient Joker is useless this round because Spades/Clubs are debuffed. Stuntman is great for a guaranteed 300 chip boost, and those Hanging Chads will make the first played card count 5 times!\\n\\nMy immediate thought is to build a Flush. Even with the debuffed cards, a Flush is the way to go. I can build a High Card hand with the Jack, it'll net me 730 chips (not good enough). A Flush, however, could be powerful. I can get about 3,500 chips, so I need to go for something BIGGER!\\n\\nMy primary focus is on drawing Hearts or Diamonds to complete a Flush. The remaining deck composition is crucial, with more Aces, Kings, Queens, or even better Jacks. Discarding the debuffed cards is a no-brainer. But I only have 2 discards, and a hand size of 6, and I want a hand that'll generate 7,664. So I *must* discard the debuffed cards. But how aggressively to do so? Do I just keep what I have and hope for the best? No, discarding to maximize my chances of getting Hearts or Diamonds is the only way.\\n\\nInitially, I'm thinking to discard just the debuffed cards (2S and AC), but it would be better to discard the lowest-value cards to maximize my odds of hitting big. I could get a solid three of a kind, but a Flush is more promising, especially with high cards. With only 6 cards, if I discard 2, I only draw 2. This does not have good odds. If I discard 3 or 4, I can make a solid hand. I need to get rid of debuffed cards, and low-value cards.\\n\\nLet's discard the debuffed cards, the Ace and 2 of Spades and see what happens. The Smeared Joker means if I can get a flush, I can keep those suits the same.\\n\\nThe math, and probability is showing me to discard 4 cards. I keep the Jack of Hearts, and try to get the other 4.\\n\\nI have 3 Aces left in the deck, plus kings and queens. Discarding is crucial. A Flush of high cards, maybe with a King or Ace would be incredible.\\n\\nThe priority is drawing Hearts/Diamonds. I still have the Jack of Hearts. Let's discard the low-value and debuffed cards.\\n\\n**Action: Discard**\\n\\n**Positions: \\\\[1, 3, 4, 5, 6]** (2 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, 4 of Diamonds), keeping the Jack of Hearts.\\n\\nThis is the play. It's time. Let's see what we get!\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 3 4 5 6\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 118]\\nAnte: 5/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ancient Joker.

It's Ante 5/8, Round 11. The current blind, \\\"The Head,\\\" debuffs Spades, which is made worse by the Smeared Joker. My goal is to hit 22,000 chips; I'm at 14,336, so I need 7,664 more. I have only three hands left and one discard.\\n\\nMy current hand is looking pretty good: Ace of Hearts (+41 chips), Jack of Hearts (+10), 8 of Hearts (+8), 7 of Hearts (+7), the debuffed 4 of Clubs, and a 9 of Diamonds (+9). My Jokers include the Ancient Joker (Spades \\u2013 useless this round), two Hanging Chads (x2 trigger first card), Smeared Joker (Hearts/Diamonds same suit, helping my hand), and Stuntman (foil, +300 chips, -2 hand size).\\n\\nI can make a Flush, Level 3: base 65 chips, mult 8. The Ace of Hearts is the key, getting a bonus of +41. Because of the Hanging Chads, the Ace of Hearts will score 5 times. Let's calculate: base 65 + (41 * 5) + 10 (Jack) + 8 (8) + 7 (7) + 9 (9) + 300 (Stuntman) = 604 chips. With a mult of 8, I'm looking at 4,832 chips.\\n\\nWith this flush, I will gain 4,832 chips. I need 7,664. After the play, I'll need 2,832 chips, and I'll have two hands left. A simple hand with the remaining two hands should easily do the trick. A discard for a better hand is not worth the risk.\\n\\nSo, I'm playing the flush now: Ace, Jack, 8, 7, and 9. Total estimated chips are 4,832. I've rechecked the calculations, made sure there are no other jokers to change the mult, and confirmed that the Stuntman is working as intended. The \\\"on played\\\" effects are not relevant. Let's make sure the Ancient Joker won't impact, and it won't this round since the suit is Spades. The Smeared Joker helps create the flush.\\n\\nThe Ace of Hearts is the best first card for the retriggers.\\n\\nI still have a discard available, but this Flush is too solid to risk a single draw. And there are plenty of Hearts/Diamonds left in the deck for another solid hand to get the chip count necessary.\\n\\nSo, the action is: `play 1 2 3 4 6` as a `flush` for `4832` chips.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 6 flush 4832\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 5/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Ancient Joker.

  "reasoning": "**Analysis and Action: The Head's Downfall**\n\nOkay, here we go. We're in Ante 5, and the Boss Blind, \"The Head,\" is up. The target is 22,000 chips, and I'm currently at 19,168. That means I need 2,832 more to clear this blind. I've got two hands left, which should be plenty. Let's assess the situation.\n\nMy hand is: Queen of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs (debuffed), 4 of Clubs (debuffed), King of Diamonds, and 7 of Diamonds. I've got a decent set of Jokers: an Ancient Joker (Spades, useless here), two Hanging Chads, a Smeared Joker (hearts/diamonds are the same suit, spades/clubs are the same), and a Stuntman (the foil edition, adding +300 chips).\n\nI initially considered a Flush (Hearts/Diamonds), but with only 4 cards of that group, and the debuffed Clubs, I can't make it. So, let's explore other options. Two Pair is a no-go, so that leaves High Card.\n\nNow, with High Card, the King of Diamonds, with a Hanging Chad x2, will retrigger 5 times!\n\nIf I play the King (5) by itself, here's how the scoring breaks down: High Card Level 2 gives me 15 chips and 2 mult. The King of Diamonds adds 10 chips and +4 Mult as an Enhancement. The Stuntman gives +300 chips. Since the Hanging Chad x2 triggers 4 additional times (4x), the King is effectively scored a total of 5 times. That gives me 365 chips and 22 mult, so I will end up with a total score of 8,030. That's more than enough. I only need 2,832.\n\nBut, before I lock it in, there's the debuff from \"The Head.\" \"All Spade cards are debuffed.\" Okay, Clubs are debuffed. But the King of Diamonds is fine. No problem there. Smeared Joker doesn't make the Diamonds debuffed (Diamonds = Hearts, Spades = Clubs).\n\nI do have two debuffed clubs, but they won't help with forming any hand.\n\nSo, the action is simple: play the King of Diamonds (pos 5) and go for the win. No need to overcomplicate things. It's the cleanest and most efficient path to victory.\n\nI also double-checked everything in my head, from Hanging Chad mechanics (5 triggers) to Stuntman's bonuses (+300 total) to ensure the math is absolutely solid.\n\nYep, 8,030 it is. That's a lock. Play 5.\n\n\n"
