{"reasoning":"**Preparing for the Final Showdown**\n\nOkay, so this is it. Ante 8/8, Round 15, and we're in the shop. My money is at $7, which isn't ideal for the final push, but I have a plan. I've got a killer Joker setup: Ancient Joker (currently Hearts), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, Stuntman (Foil), and the Negative 8 Ball. I also have The Sun (ready to convert cards to Hearts, crucial for the Ancient Joker) and The Hermit (doubles my money).\n\nMy top priority right now is to maximize my buying power for the shop. The Hermit is the key here. It doubles my money, from $7 to $14. That's a significant boost and the only real way to have any impact in this shop.\n\nSo, here's the thought process: I *must* use The Hermit now. That's step one.\n\nThe question then becomes: What do I buy with the boosted funds? I'm debating between a few options:\n\n*   **Wasteful Voucher ($10):** This gives me an extra discard, which offers flexibility, especially when combined with a Banner (which I already have).\n*   **Arcana Packs ($4):** These could give me even more of The Sun or a planet card to boost my current Jokers.\n*   **Banner ($5):** Gives +30 Chips per Discard.\n\nI have decided to hold back on the Banner; Stuntman is already giving me 300 chips. \n\nSo, with $14, I could buy the Wasteful Voucher and have $4 left. Or, I could buy 2x Arcana Packs.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1.  **Use The Hermit**. I'm initiating the consumable on the board.\n2.  **Buy**. That is step 2.\n\nLet's start there.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
