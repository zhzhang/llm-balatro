{"reasoning":"**Strategic Round 7 Decision: Celestial Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. We're in the shop phase, round 7, and have a Celestial Pack in front of us. Currently, I've got $2, so let's make this count. My Ante is at 4/8. I've got a decent Joker setup: Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5), 2x Hanging Chad (retrigger the first card twice), Smeared Joker (Hearts/Diamonds same, Spades/Clubs same), and Stuntman (foil, +300 Chips, -2 hand size). Hand levels are decent, ranging from L2 for Three of a Kind, Pair, and High Card, and up to L3 for Flush, and L4 for Full House.\n\nThe key is leveraging these Jokers. Ancient Joker's multiplier on Hearts is the cornerstone, amplified by Smeared Joker merging Hearts and Diamonds. The Sun card previously gave me lots of Hearts. Hanging Chads are important for retriggering the first card in the hand.\n\nMy overall strategy is clear: I need to maximize hands where the first card is a Heart or Diamond. I've been riding Flushes and Full Houses recently, but I need to make some decisions here.\n\nNow, let's look at the pack choices: Pluto (High Card, L2 -> L3), Mercury (Pair, L2 -> L3), and Venus (Three of a Kind, L2 -> L3). I can dismiss High Card unless forced. A Pair is a component of many higher hands (Three of a Kind, Full House). Three of a Kind is generally stronger than Pair and High Card.\n\nLet's do the math on the levels. Full House is at Level 4 (Base Chips 115, Base Mult 10). Flush is L3 (Base Chips 65, Base Mult 8). Three of a Kind is L2 (Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5). Pair is L2 (Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3). Considering Stuntman's huge bonus chips (+300), the base chips from the hand level are less critical than the base Mult (since Stuntman dominates the Chips side).\n\nThe Venus card (Three of a Kind) increases my Mult by +2. Mercury (Pair) increases Mult by +1. Pluto (High Card) increases my Mult by +1. Three of a Kind is the strongest scaling option, as a strong base, even with Full House and Flush as my goals.\n\n**Therefore, I'll select the Venus card (Three of a Kind). No specific card targets in my hand matter.**\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
