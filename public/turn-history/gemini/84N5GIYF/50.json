{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Decision: Choosing Temperance**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 3/8, Round 4, Jumbo Arcana Pack. I have $17. The goal is to maximize my score this round and set myself up for the future.\n\nMy Jokers are decent: Ice Cream provides chips, Ancient Joker offers a multiplier on Hearts (currently). The two Hanging Chads are powerful and can retrigger cards, and Rocket is there for the economy.\n\nI'm staring at these Tarot Booster choices: The Tower (not helpful this round), The Moon (changing Clubs, which *could* screw up my Ancient Joker bonus), The Devil (meh, for future gold farming), Temperance (guaranteed $13), and The Wheel of Fortune (a risky 25% chance for a buffed Joker).\n\nMy hand is a mix of suits: 6S, 3S, JH, 3H, KC, 5C, 2C, 3D. I really want to keep those Hearts to trigger that Ancient Joker multiplier!\n\nMy initial thought was `The Moon` to change suits and take advantage of the Ancient Joker, but the Tower, Moon and Devil don't help much here. `The Wheel of Fortune` is tempting, but too risky. A Polychrome on a Joker would be fantastic, but I've learned in Balatro that consistency is key. That $13 from `Temperance` is significant—it’s 76% of my current money. That's a huge boost for future shop purchases or rerolls. It also gives me more room to play with.\n\nI had to rethink the command syntax. It's `select <pack_card_position>`. Temperance is position 4 in the pack. I double-checked the documentation to be certain.\n\nSo, I'm going with `Temperance`. I need to stay disciplined and focus on building a solid base. The potential swing of `Wheel of Fortune` isn't worth it right now. `Temperance` it is: guaranteed cash to smooth out my run. Let's make that selection and get ready for the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
