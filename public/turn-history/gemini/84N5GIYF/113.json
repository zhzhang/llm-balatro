{"reasoning":"**Okay, here's the plan. I'm staring down a tricky Blind, \"The Head,\" which is debuffing Spades. The Smeared Joker is making Clubs count as Spades, too, which is the real kicker.**\n\nI have a killer hand: Ace, 5, 3 of Hearts, plus Queen and 10 of Diamonds. That's a Flush, and the Smeared Joker means it counts! No Spades in sight. Excellent. I have The Empress consumable and two Hanging Chads, which re-trigger a card. The Empress needs to be used on two cards. Stuntman gives a solid +300 Chips.\n\nThe goal is 22,000 chips. I think this play can get me there. If I enhance the Ace and Queen into Mult cards with \"The Empress\" they'll be fantastic.\n\nHere's the optimal move, let's get it done:\n\nI'm ready to use the consumable.\n\nHere's the command: `use_consumable <consumeable_position> <target_card_position1> <target_card_position2>`.\n\nConsumable is the Empress, so position `1`.\nTarget card 1 is the Ace, position `1`.\nTarget card 2 is the Queen, position `5`.\n\nI should use the Empress on the Ace (position 1) and the Queen (position 5). I'm set!\n\nThe Empress enhances two selected cards, I have selected the Ace and the Queen.\n\nJSON looks good!\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 1, 5]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,1,5]"}
