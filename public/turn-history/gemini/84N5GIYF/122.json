{"reasoning":"**The Optimal Move: Prioritizing Joker Acquisition**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante is 6/8, Round 11. I'm at a \"BLIND\\_SELECT\" game step, with only $1. The current blind is the Small Blind (20,000 chips). The crucial thing here is the \"Negative Tag\". That tag means the *next* base edition shop Joker will be free *and* become a Negative Joker. This is huge, and almost always worth prioritizing.\n\nMy current jokers are: Ancient Joker (Hearts - X1.5 Mult), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker (Hearts/Diamonds same), and Stuntman (+300 Chips, -2 hand size).  I have a reduced hand size, which makes fishing for flushes a little harder, but the Ancient Joker combined with the Hanging Chads makes high card plays incredibly lucrative with Hearts/Diamonds.\n\nThe boss, \"The Window,\" debuffs all Heart cards. Smeared Joker makes Hearts and Diamonds count as the same suit, so that sounds like a problem, but hold on. Ancient Joker says \"Each played card with Heart suit\". Smeared Joker says \"Hearts and Diamonds count as the same suit\". So, a diamond counts as a Heart for Ancient Joker's trigger, and my reading of the Boss's effect is that it will *only* debuff Hearts, not Diamonds. This looks good.\n\nI have $1. Playing the small blind gives $3, but even with that I won't have much money for the next shop. Skipping the Small Blind gets me the Negative Tag. So I have to decide if a little bit of money now is more valuable than getting a free Joker soon. It isn't. The Negative Tag makes a Joker free. I *need* joker slots or high quality Jokers.\n\nMy current setup with Ancient Joker, Smeared Joker, and Hanging Chads can easily clear the 30,000 chip blind. A single Heart/Diamond flush could generate around 24,000 chips. Even high cards are really powerful here.\n\nGiven the current setup, the Negative Tag's potential is a significantly better long-term investment.\n\nMy plan is to skip the round, take the Big Blind, and then face \"The Window\". I can absolutely handle 30k chips with the current setup. After that, I get a free, potentially Negative, Joker.\n\nAction: `skip_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
