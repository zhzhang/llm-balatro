{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis for Blind Select**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 5, Ante 3/8, Boss Blind is \"The Club,\" meaning all Club cards are debuffed. I need 4000 chips, and I have a measly $15. Let's see if this hand of cards can get me through. My Jokers are: Ice Cream (+80 chips), Ancient Joker (x1.5 Mult for Clubs, changing suits after the round), two Hanging Chads (retrigger the first played card 2 extra times each), and Smeared Joker (Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs).\n\nThe key here is Smeared Joker. Since it turns Spades into Clubs for triggering, I can work around the \"The Club\" debuff. The debuff affects actual Club cards; it doesn't affect Spades that are *acting* as Clubs.\n\nMy scoring plan is simple: lead with a Spade. The Hanging Chads will retrigger it four times (initially + 4 retriggers = 5 times this card is used in scoring). Each instance should trigger Ancient Joker's x1.5 multiplier because the Spade is counted as a Club.\n\nLet's do a Joker check-in: Ice Cream's +80 chips is independent (Step 5). Ancient Joker's x1.5 multiplier for Clubs is an \"On Scored\" joker (Step 3). The Hanging Chads are \"Retrigger\" jokers (Step 3). Smeared Joker is purely a card modifier (Step 3).\n\nI need to nail down the joker order. Based on the rules, it's: Boss effects (Step 1), \"On Played\" Jokers (Step 2), then played cards are scored left-to-right (Step 3): base chips, card modifiers, \"On scored\" Jokers, then retriggers. Step 4 is Held-in-hand and Step 5 is Independent Jokers. \"On Scored\" Jokers and Retriggers happen in Step 3.\n\nThe thing is, Ancient Joker x1.5 triggers *during* Step 3. Hanging Chad is a retrigger. So when the first card scores: the card scores (chips), Ancient Joker (x1.5) triggers, Hanging Chad triggers a retrigger, then the process repeats for the retrigger. Does it matter where Ancient Joker or Hanging Chad sit in Step 3? Yes, the retrigger *repeats the entire Step 3 sequence*. Since Ancient Joker is to the left of Hanging Chad, it will trigger on the retrigger too.\n\nThe optimal general order is to put +mult jokers to the left of xMult Jokers. I have no +Mult jokers. Ice Cream is +Chips in Step 5, so the order of the first 4 doesn't strictly change the math *as long as* Ancient Joker is present. However, if I had an xMult joker, like a Polychrome Joker, I would want it at the end (Step 5). Smeared Joker is purely utility. One last optimization: If I had a +Mult card (like from a Mult card enhancement), the Ancient Joker's x1.5 would then multiply that +Mult.\n\nLet's look at the current order: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, Chad, Chad, Smeared. Hand Mult (base) + Card Mult -> Ancient Joker (x1.5) -> Retrigger (Ancient Joker x1.5) -> ... -> Ice Cream (+Chips). This is perfect.\n\nQuick Boss check: \"All Club cards are debuffed.\" If I play a Spade, Smeared Joker makes it a Club for Ancient Joker. The Spade itself is *not* a Club card, so it is not debuffed. Ancient Joker sees the Spade *as* a Club and triggers. Good to go.\n\nThere's no reason to sell or use anything else. Shop's gone, no consumables. Now, I should `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
