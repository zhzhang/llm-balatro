{"reasoning":"**Shop Woes and Blind Anticipation**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop, but it's a bit of a bust. I've only got $2, and everything's out of reach – Mercury, Smiley Face, Arcana Pack, even the Reroll Glut. Can't even afford a reroll for $3. Looks like I'm stuck leaving empty-handed. Since I'm tapped out, and I can't buy anything, my only option is to move on to the next phase, which will be Blind Select.\n\nI'm ready to move on. Right now I am thinking that the correct command is `round_select`.\n\nThinking through my current game state, the important details are: I have the Ancient Joker, currently influenced by my Smeared Joker. My best hand levels available are Flush at Level 3 and Full House at Level 5. My previous hand, a Flush, earned me a massive 133,475 chips. I need to make sure I am prepared for the Big Blind.\n\nMy Ancient Joker is currently triggered by Hearts, which is what I need to keep in mind.\n\nSo, `round_select` it is. No specific hand type in mind yet, I'll figure that out based on the cards I get. And now I need a valid JSON, so I'll just formulate the command.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"round_select\"}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
