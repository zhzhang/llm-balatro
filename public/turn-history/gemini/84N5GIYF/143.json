{"reasoning":"**Ante 7 Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 7, Round 14, gearing up for the next blind. This is a crucial shop phase, and I need to optimize my next move. I've got a tight budget – $0 – so buying anything is off the table right away. Let's run through the options:\n\n*   **Buying:** Obviously not possible with $0.\n*   **Selling Consumables:** I could sell Strength or The World for a measly $1 each, but that's not enough for anything.\n*   **Selling Jokers:** Definitely a consideration, but I have a strong joker setup for a Flush build. The Ancient Joker on Spades is crucial, along with Smeared Joker. These are core to my strategy. Selling either would be counterproductive, even for a small cash infusion.\n*   **Rearranging Jokers:** Let's think this through. My current lineup is: Ancient Joker, Hanging Chad x2, Smeared Joker, Stuntman, 8 Ball. I need to make sure I'm maximizing my *Ancient Joker*'s effect. It gives 1.5x Mult per Spade scored, so order could matter here...\n    *   **Joker Logic Check:** Remembering the rules of joker order, Ancient Joker is an \"on scored\" effect, which is different than \"independent\" Mult. On scored Mult generally applies during the scoring phase, while independent mult adds to the card at a separate stage, typically after chips and additive mult have been applied.\n    *   **Order Review:** With the *Ancient Joker* as an \"on scored\" effect, its position doesn't hugely matter unless there are additive multipliers or other \"on score\" effects on the card *before* the *Ancient Joker* triggers. *Hanging Chad* retriggers a card's scoring sequence. *Stuntman* (Foil edition) adds flat chips. *8 Ball* is just a negative effect.\n    *   **Position Doesn't Matter (much):** The *Ancient Joker*'s 1.5x Multi happens when the card scores, so its position relative to the *Hanging Chads* isn't critical because the *Chads* retrigger the entire scoring sequence. *Stuntman*'s flat chip bonus doesn't care about position either. *8 Ball* is last, and so position is also not critical for it.\n*   **The Verdict:** With no money to buy, and no compelling reason to sell any of my jokers, the only viable action is to proceed to the next round. I'm ready to beat Ante 7. My Mega Celestial Pack value has been maximized by taking Earth and Venus, my consumables are ready, my jokers are optimized (for now), and it's time to advance!\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
