{"reasoning":"**The Shop's My Oyster**\n\nOkay, so it's Round 12, Ante 6/8, and I've got $8. The Boss Blind coming up is a heart debuff, but with my Smeared Joker, I'm covered because Hearts and Diamonds are the same, and I'll just avoid playing hearts. This also means my Ancient Joker is firing for both Spades and Clubs, since Smeared Joker makes those the same suit. My hand is built around Flush/High Card mostly, so I don't really need the planet cards for this build.\n\nI have the Negative Tag, and it's practically screaming to be used, specifically for the next base edition shop Joker. The problem is, there isn't a Joker in the shop right now. To activate it, I need one to *appear*. \n\nHere's the breakdown: A reroll costs $3. If I reroll and a Joker shows up, it's free and gets the Negative Tag. This means an extra Joker for zero cost. That's a huge deal. Buying a pack is risky because it doesn't guarantee a Joker, even a Jumbo Celestial Pack, plus, I'd be spending cash without immediate value.\n\nRerolling is my only solid play here. With $8, I'm choosing to `reroll_shop`, spending $3. This will leave me with $5. If a Joker shows up, it's mine, and I can either buy a card with the remaining $5, or save it. If no Joker appears, I'll be in the same boat, but at least I took a chance.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
