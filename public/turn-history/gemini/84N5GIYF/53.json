{"reasoning":"**The Blind Decision: Play or Skip?**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 3/8, Big Blind (Round 4), with $27. I need 3000 chips. Skipping gives me the Handy Tag, which is only $5 total since I've played a few hands already. Not a great deal. My alternative is to play the Big Blind, which gives $4 reward + interest + Rocket ($1) + remaining hands bonus. So, probably ~$8 in total. This lets me get a shop phase, which is crucial for finding more Jokers or planets, and this build is going to make it easy to hit the 3000 chip target with a few well-played hands. The next blind is a Boss (The Club), and the Boss debuffs Clubs. I need to get through this Blind to try to make the next blind easier.\n\nI've got a killer build: Ice Cream (+85 Chips, -5 per hand), Ancient Joker (X1.5 Mult for Hearts), and two Hanging Chads (Retrigger the first played card 2 times each, for a total of 5 triggers). Plus, Rocket! (Economy) and The Hierophant. The Hierophant is tricky, I need to use it *during* the round itself.\n\nNow, about that Ancient Joker... the text says \"Heart suit,\" and it *should* still be Hearts. I've been watching the suit, it seems static. If I start with a Heart, that's going to be a lot of damage. A King of Hearts (10 chips) with Ice Cream (~80 chips) gets 90 chips * 5 triggers = 450 base. Multipliers? (Base Mult) * (1.5 ^ 5) = Base Mult * 7.59. A Flush and a high-value card would make this easy.\n\nI think the best Joker order is: Ice Cream, Ancient Joker, Hanging Chad, Rocket, Hanging Chad. Hang on... The Hanging Chads trigger *after* the base chips are scored and the Ancient Joker activates. Okay, I've got this. The Ancient Joker multiplies based on the Hearts suit, then the Chads retrigger that multiple. The Rocket will continue to accumulate.\n\nSo, I'm definitely going to play this round. `play_round` is the obvious command. Need the money, need the shop. 3000 chips is trivial with this set-up. And the JSON schema wants \"action\".\n\nOkay, the Ancient Joker is still Hearts. All systems are go. Time to smash the Big Blind!\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
