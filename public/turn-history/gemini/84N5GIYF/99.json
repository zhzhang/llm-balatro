{"reasoning":"**Analysis of a Tight Situation**\n\nOkay, Ante 5/8, Round 8, and I'm in the Shop phase. The game step is SHOP, I've got a measly $2, and my Joker lineup is looking pretty solid: Ancient Joker (Clubs), two Hanging Chads, another two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, and Stuntman. I'm at my full Joker capacity, with 5 Jokers equipped, and I have no consumables, as I haven't acquired any.\n\nThe shop offerings are tempting, but sadly, I'm out of luck. Mercury and Venus each go for $3, the Standard Pack is a bit pricey at $4, and even the Reroll Glut voucher is a whopping $10.  The current reroll cost itself is a prohibitive $3.  With only two dollars, I can't afford *anything* here.\n\nThinking about my Jokers, I can use my Ancient Joker, which is currently on Clubs, in tandem with my Smeared Joker. That makes Spades and Clubs equivalent. The Hanging Chads are going to retrigger the first card. And, most importantly, the Stuntman joker provides a huge chip boost, especially as I can see it's foiled.  I just had a fantastic round, racking up 136k chips, so this setup is clearly working.\n\nI'm out of options. I can't buy anything, I can't reroll, and I'm not in a position to sell any of my Jokers, as the line-up is very strong for this stage. I can't even sell consumables, because I don't have any! The only viable play is to proceed to the round selection screen. The `round_select` action is what I need. It doesn't take any arguments, so let's get this show on the road.\n\nMy action will be `round_select`. The corresponding JSON is `{\"action\": \"round_select\"}`. Done.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
