{"reasoning":"**Current Round Assessment: Small Blind - Phase: BLIND_SELECT**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante is at 7/8, this is Round 13. I'm facing the Small Blind, 35,000 chips. The skip reward? A measly Economy Tag, doubling my money... which is currently $1. So, skipping gets me a whole $2. That's a joke. Playing nets me $3, plus interest (though, at $1, that's not helping much now), but more importantly, it lets me play the game. Playing the round is crucial to manipulating the deck, and ultimately, to shopping.\n\nMy hand setup is interesting, to say the least.\n\nI've got the Ancient Joker, multiplying Hearts' value by 1.5 per card, two Hanging Chads, which effectively re-trigger the first card in my hand 5 times total, the Smeared Joker, making Hearts and Diamonds equivalent, the Stuntman giving me an immediate chip boost (at the cost of my hand size), and the troublesome 8 Ball joker, which offers a chance at drawing tarot cards on eights.\n\nConsumables are Strength and The World, but I can't use them in this blind selection phase. I also have the following vouchers: Grabber, Planet Merchant, Hone, and Reroll Surplus.\n\nConsidering my current resources, playing this blind seems like the only sensible choice. Skipping for an extra dollar is completely useless. I need the shop to find better scaling or more money.\n\nStrategically, the Ancient Joker is on Hearts, and with the Smeared Joker, Hearts and Diamonds are now essentially the same suit for scoring purposes. Double Hanging Chad triggers are going to be wild - that first card is going to be re-drawn a lot. Stuntman is providing a chip base. This sets me up for a potentially huge flush using Hearts and Diamonds, with a Heart or Diamond as the first card in my hand.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n*   `play_round`: Absolutely the best move. No contest.\n*   `skip_round`: Laughable.\n*   `use_consumable`: Not applicable.\n*   `sell_consumable`/`sell_joker`: No reason to do either.\n*   `rearrange_jokers`: Ancient, Chad, Chad, Smeared, Stuntman. The ordering seems fine, generally you want any fixed multiplier jokers before ones that provide a multiplier *on* a multiplier, but in this case the Ancient Joker's order doesn't matter much. Stuntman's fixed chips are a base, not a multiplier.\n\nAction: I'm playing the round.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
