{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Optimal Play: Joker Selection & Shop Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I've got $44 and a hand of Jokers I need to optimize. My primary focus right now is maximizing scoring for future antes. I've got a strong suite of Jokers: `Greedy Joker`, `The Idol`, `Ice Cream`, `Ancient Joker`, and `Hanging Chad`. The `Hone` voucher is interesting, but not immediately actionable. Let's delve into the crucial choices here.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are centered on leveraging the synergy between `Greedy Joker` (suit Mult), `The Idol` (Jack of Diamonds x2 Mult), and `Hanging Chad` (retrigger first card). However, `Ancient Joker` (x1.5 Mult for Hearts) is also a strong contender, offering further potential if I can play to its strengths. `Ice Cream` provides a significant early chip boost, but its impact is time-limited.\n\nLooking at the shop, the `Invisible Joker` is a standout ($8). This card's ability to duplicate a random Joker after two rounds could be game-changing, especially if it hits one of my high-value cards like `The Idol`, `Ancient Joker` or `Hanging Chad`. However, with a full hand of Jokers, I must sell one to obtain it.\n\nI'm also considering the `Credit Card (Holo)` ($4), which offers a flat +10 Mult. While the Mult is substantial, it doesn't have the same long-term potential as a duplicated powerful Joker. This would be a great buy as well.\n\nThe key decision boils down to which Joker to sacrifice. Initially, I leaned toward `Greedy Joker` (+3 Mult per diamond), as it's the weakest multiplicatively. `Ice Cream` offers vital early chips, but it's not a long-term investment.\n\nMy priority is `Invisible Joker`. It has immense potential if it replicates any of my high-value Jokers. I can sell `Greedy Joker` for $2. I have $44, so after the sell, I can buy `Invisible Joker`.\n\nI was slightly sidetracked by the `Credit Card (Holo)`. While +10 Mult is appealing, it doesn't compare to duplicating a Joker with an existing x2 or x1.5 Mult.\n\n**Therefore, the optimal first step is to sell the `Greedy Joker` (at position 1). Then, I will buy the `Invisible Joker`.** This strategy sets up for a potentially huge power spike after two rounds. I will execute this by invoking the appropriate command: `sell_joker` and sending position `1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
