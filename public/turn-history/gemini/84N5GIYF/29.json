{"reasoning":"**Round 2: Strategic Assessment**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 2, Round 2, and in the BLIND_SELECT phase. I've got $32 and a pretty decent joker setup. Let's break this down.\n\nMy current jokers are: The Idol (Jack of Diamonds x2), Ice Cream (+95 Chips, -5/hand), Ancient Joker (Hearts x1.5), Hanging Chad (Retrigger first played card 2x), and the Invisible Joker (0/2 rounds). The Boss Blind, The Pillar, is going to be a pain - 1 in 7 cards are face down, and I need 1600 chips to clear it. I have the Hone voucher. No consumables in hand to utilize at this time.\n\nThe goal is 1600 chips to beat the boss. The immediate constraint is dealing with the face-down card mechanic. The ideal joker order is as follows:\n\n1.  Ice Cream: Since it's a flat chip bonus, it goes first.\n2.  Then, any general +Mult jokers. Not present, so.\n3.  \"On scored\" jokers: I have Idol and Ancient Joker.\n4.  Finally, Hanging Chad (re-triggers the first card)\n\nHanging Chad is interesting here. It *triggers after* the initial card score, but before xMult multipliers are summed. This is important to optimize. I see. If the first card is a Heart or a Jack of Diamonds, Chad will trigger those xMults *again*, which can lead to insane returns.\n\nCurrently, the joker order is: Idol (1), Ice Cream (2), Ancient Joker (3), Hanging Chad (4), Invisible Joker (5). Given the commutative nature of xMult, Idol and Ancient Joker can be swapped, the order doesn't matter between those two. Ice Cream doesn't care.\n\nSince I am at the select screen, there's only one viable action. I have to `play_round` to start the Blind. I have all my jokers. My shop is processed.\n\nTherefore, the action is `play_round`. Time to crush this blind.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
