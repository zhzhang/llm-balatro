{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop Before the Big Blind**\n\nOkay, here we are at the shop, Ante 5/8, Round 9. I have $8. The goal is clear: maximize my score this round and prep for the Boss Blind, \"The Head,\" which debuffs Spades.\n\nMy current setup is pretty solid: I'm running Ancient Joker (Hearts - now effectively Hearts/Diamonds, thanks to Smeared Joker), two Hanging Chads, Smeared Joker, and Stuntman. Ancient Joker is the cornerstone with its suit multiplier, which is now triggered by *both* Hearts and Diamonds. The Hanging Chads will retrigger that key card, potentially stacking the multiplier significantly. I have a Foil Stuntman, which adds a flat chip bonus of +250.\n\nI'm focused on a Flush build, currently at Level 3 (65x8 mult), and Full House at Level 4 (115x10). The Boss debuffs Spades, but since Smeared Joker makes Spades count as Clubs for all purposes, the damage *might* be minimized, especially since Ancient Joker should still trigger regardless of the suit penalty. The only danger is if I'm forced to play Spades for the Flush, but even then, the Joker effects should mitigate some of the debuff.\n\nLooking at the shop, Mercury, which upgrades Pairs, is useless for me, and Smiley Face, which gives +5 mult to face cards, is pointless since I have no spare joker slots. I have to choose between a Jumbo Celestial Pack, and an Arcana Pack. The Jumbo Celestial Pack has 5 options while the Arcana Pack has 3. If I choose to spend $6 on the Jumbo Celestial Pack, I only have $2 left; if I choose to buy the Arcana Pack for $4, I have $4 left. I also have to consider that I don't have enough money to buy any re-rolls.\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack looks like the better option, I think. I can potentially level up my Flush directly with Jupiter or other high value cards, which gives more immediate power to my main scoring hand. The Arcana Pack could give me cards to change the deck but that's less consistent than directly leveling up a hand. With the state of the deck, and my current level, the Jumbo Celestial Pack is the safer bet. Plus, I don't have an option to reroll any of these for free.\n\nI have 15 Hearts, 13 Diamonds, meaning 28 \"Hearts\" in the deck. That's more than half the deck! My chances are even greater of hitting the multiplier!\n\n*Wait*, maybe I should re-evaluate. I could get a \"The Star\" in the Arcana Pack which is a good choice to convert cards. But it's only 3 cards. It's a gamble. The Jumbo Celestial Pack, on the other hand, is much more likely to give me the direct power I need.\n\nNo, I need to spend the money I have on the best option. I will get the Jumbo Celestial Pack. It directly supports my current winning strategy. I have to make the decision quickly.\n\nAction: `buy_booster`, position: 2.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
