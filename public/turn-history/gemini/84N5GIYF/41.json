{"reasoning":"**My Shop Strategy: Reroll for the Win**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: Ante 3, $22 in the bank, and my Joker setup is pretty sweet. I'm rocking Ice Cream, Ancient Joker (diamonds this round, which I like), Hanging Chad, Invisible Joker (about to pop!), and Rocket. I also have the Planet Merchant voucher and Hone. The shop only has Stuntman right now.\n\nMy immediate goal? Trigger that Invisible Joker. To do that, I *need* to beat the next blind. I have a Polychrome Wild Ace and a Holo 8 of Spades, so I'm confident. The Ancient Joker combined with the Polychrome Wild Ace should give me insane multiplier potential just from playing the first card. The Ice Cream provides some solid chips on top.\n\nStuntman looks *tempting*. That +250 chips is juicy, especially since it's a Rare Joker, and it's decaying now. However, I have a big issue: I am running a Flush strategy. Stuntman has -2 Hand Size, which can kill my potential. That -2 is a big problem if Invisible Joker copies it. Four cards? Yikes! I am incentivized to play hands that score multiple cards. With 6 cards, there's roughly a 15% chance to find a Flush. This isn't worth the risk.\n\nSo, here's my plan. I'm going to *reroll*. I've got Planet Merchant, and Hone is giving me even better odds of getting a good card or even a better Joker. I don't need Stuntman to win the next round, and the reroll is a good use of the shop mechanics. My deck is strong and I can win without a new Joker. My current Jokers are all valuable.\n\nUltimately, I'm confident in my deck's power. It can win the next round easily. Rerolling is the way to play the shop.\n\n**Action: `reroll_shop`**\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
