{"reasoning":"**The Shop Decision: Celestial Pack First**\n\nOkay, here we are in the shop phase of Balatro. Ante 4, Round 6, with $18 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Ice Cream for chips, Ancient Joker for diamond multiplication, two Hanging Chads for retriggering, and Smeared Joker which is key, especially since I'm running the diamond Ancient Joker. I'm also holding the Planet Merchant and Hone Vouchers. Flush is at level 2 and Full House at level 4 – nice hand levels to have.\n\nLet's break down the shop items. I'm not touching the Green Joker or Wrathful Joker; I'm at Joker capacity and they don't fit the build. Reroll Surplus is tempting for the long game but needs to be evaluated relative to the immediate options. A single reroll is too expensive now.\n\nRight now I have:\n*   Celestial Pack ($4)\n*   Reroll Surplus ($10)\nI'll focus on boosting my hand right now.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are the Celestial Pack. I need to level up my Flush or Full House, so I should see the pack immediately. I'll have $14 left after the purchase. This is going to be my move. I'm not in a position to reroll just yet.\n\nNow, let me think about my Jokers. The Chads are crucial for triggering the Diamond + Ancient Joker synergy; Smeared Joker guarantees the Ancient Joker activates on Diamonds and Hearts. The Ice Cream helps pad the chips. The order of the Jokers matters for any on-score joker effect, and in this case, the Ancient Joker comes second. That means the multiplier activates immediately. The order isn't so important right now because there's no +Mult joker. The key is that the Chads retrigger the Diamond Mult Card enhanced cards.\n\nSo, I'm buying the Celestial Pack because it has the immediate effect of leveling my hands. I want to buy the pack.\n\n**Action: `buy_booster 1`**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
