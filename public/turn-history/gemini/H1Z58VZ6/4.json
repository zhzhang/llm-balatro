I already grabbed a Holographic Tag earlier by skipping the Small Blind, which means the next base edition Joker I find will get a +10 Mult boost. Now I'm staring down the barrel of 450 chips for the Big Blind. I've got $4. The reward for the Big Blind is a measly $4, but skipping it gets me a Foil Tag. So, the question is, do I want to skip the Blind and roll the dice on the Boss fight, or play it safe and guarantee a shop?\\n\\nI'm evaluating my options: Playing the blind is easy; I can get a shop immediately after. This lets me use the Holographic Tag to get a free, +10 Mult Joker, and potentially pick up some economy items. That's the safer play and sets me up for a good start. I can easily make 450 chips with a single strong hand, or even a couple of weaker ones. I can aim for a flush or full house.\\n\\nSkipping the Big Blind, on the other hand, means I hit the Boss Blind, with its Spades debuff, and only have $5 + $1 (interest) to make plays with. It also means I get a Foil Tag, which is good for +50 chips. It's risky. But, with both tags, I'd get *two* free Jokers in the shop after the Boss.\\n\\nThe risk is the Boss, 600 chips with a debuff. Can I do it with the starter deck and no Jokers? Maybe. A strong Flush or Full House could get it done. The debuff on Spades really hurts, though. That complicates things... I'll have to play carefully, maybe focus on non-Spade hands.\\n\\nHere's the problem: The Holographic Joker, early, is huge. +10 Mult. Very good. It's the safer play. Grabbing the Foil Tag is a gamble, and might not even pan out in my favor if I can't beat the Boss and get to a shop. Plus, playing gives me the shop *immediately*. The shop is good! Vouchers, planets, Tarots! That early shop could make the run.\\n\\nIf I play it smart, I can make 450 chips without Jokers. It's a no-brainer. After the Big Blind, I hit the shop, get that Holographic Joker, and build an economy. I'm taking the safe route.\\n\\nSo, the action is `play_round`. Time to crush that Big Blind.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play_round\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 3]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Holographic Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Big.\\nChips Needed: 450\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Ace of Hearts.

Big blind is 450, which is my immediate goal. I've got a decent, but not killer, starting hand: Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds, and 5 of Diamonds. My priority right now is maximizing my chance of reaching the target. I'm thinking about the potential hands I can make.\\n\\nI see a pair of Aces. That's a decent start, 64 chips with the multiplier, but it's not going to get me 450. A flush in hearts, with the four I already have, would be far more lucrative. So, the question is, how do I best set up for a flush? I need to discard the less helpful cards.\\n\\nI need to decide what to discard. Discarding everything that isn't a heart to go for the flush is risky, but it has the best payout if it hits. The ace of clubs is useful for the pair, but the potential for a flush is greater. My odds of hitting a heart in 3 draws are around 51%, and it would be significantly higher with the Ace of Clubs gone. With the flush multiplier, a successful flush would be huge, about 284 chips!\\n\\nShould I also discard the Ace of Clubs? If I'm purely hunting for the flush, absolutely. It's a strategic trade-off. However, I can still use the pair as a fallback position.\\n\\nGiven the goal and the resources, the optimal play here is to discard the non-hearts, which means discarding the Ace of Clubs, the 8 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds, and the 5 of Diamonds. That's a discard of positions 5, 6, 7, and 8. Discarding 4 cards is a very good opportunity here. The higher chance of the flush means I can get to the blind goal faster.\\n\\nYes, discarding positions [5, 6, 7, 8] is the correct play. My decision is now solidified. It is best, given my current goal, to discard positions 5, 6, 7, and 8 (Ace of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds), aiming for a heart flush. I confirm this for the JSON format.\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"action\\\": \\\"discard\\\",\\n  \\\"positions\\\": [5, 6, 7, 8],\\n  \\\"intended_hand_type\\\": null,\\n  \\\"estimated_chips\\\": null\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 5 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Holographic Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Big.\\nChips Needed: 450\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Jack of Spades.

My current hand looks like this: Jack of Spades, 2 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, and 4 of Diamonds. I'm sitting on $4 right now, and I have that Holographic Tag active, which is a nice bonus for later.\\n\\nMy primary goal, of course, is to get those 450 chips. My analysis tells me that I currently have four Hearts (Ace, King, 6, 4) in my hand, and I have a decent chance of completing a flush. There are only four cards left in my deck, so I am going to make the most of those draws.\\n\\nI'm holding two pairs (6s and 4s) in my hand, but that isn't worth holding onto for this round. Considering the goal, I need to go for a flush. Based on the cards, I'm going to discard the Jack of Spades, 2 of Spades, 6 of Clubs, and 4 of Diamonds. That leaves me with positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 containing my heart cards, which is the right move. I need that fifth heart.\\n\\nLet's double-check the logic. Yes, the correct cards to discard are indeed positions 1, 2, 7, and 8. The pair of 6s is a trap in this situation and going for the flush is a higher payoff.\\n\\nThe odds of hitting a heart on the next draw are quite favorable, around 67%. So, I'm confident. I will discard those non-heart cards in positions 1, 2, 7, and 8.

  "reasoning": "**My Decision Process: Fish for the Flush**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 1, Ante 1, Big Blind. I'm starting from scratch, with zero chips and a 450-chip target. I have four hands left, and two discards available. This hand… let's see. Ace, King, 6, and 4 of Hearts – a promising start. I also see a pair of 6s, and a possible straight with the 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nMy gut says go for the flush. I can calculate the probability. With 9 hearts left in the deck out of 36 cards, I calculate about 78% chance I'll hit a heart in a single discard. The potential payoff for the flush is around 280 chips, maybe even more with the Ace and King in play, so potentially over 300. The straight is solid, but will only get me around 220 chips, and then I'm still left needing another 230 to win.\n\nPlaying the straight leaves me with the high cards, but fishing for the flush with a high probability and two chances seems optimal. Even one flush is a significant boost. Two flushes and I'm golden, or at least a flush and a smaller hand. I have to discard the 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 6 of Diamonds and the 3 of Diamonds.\n\nWait, should I play the straight? No, the flush is still the better long-term play. Now I'm re-analyzing, and I can confirm that the straight is ~220 chips. I am happy to stick with the original plan.\n\nOne more card check to be certain that I am discarding correctly. Yes, those four cards are the discards: 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 6 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds. This is standard strategy for this situation.\n\nAnd let me just be extra sure about the estimated chips, it is discarding.\n\nOkay, everything looks right, mathematically and intuitively. The action is 'discard' with the positions [5, 6, 7, 8]. I am not changing my mind. I am ready for the flush.\n\n\n"
