{"reasoning":"**Strategic Hand Selection for Victory**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. We're at Ante 3/8, Round 9, in the \"SELECTING_HAND\" phase, specifically during the Boss Blind: The Wheel. My goal is to hit 4000 chips; I'm currently at 3528, meaning I need 472 more. I have two hands remaining, four discards. High Card is the chosen hand type; it's currently at Level 4, which gives a base of 35 chips and a base multiplier of 4.\n\nI've got a solid Joker setup.  \"Blue Joker\" adds +102 chips to the pot, based on the cards in my deck. \"Mail-In Rebate,\" a holographic Joker, grants +10 mult and gives me $5 for discarded 6's (rank changes every round). And \"Ride the Bus,\" also holographic, gives a +10 mult because the previous hand was a non-face card. DNA and Brainstorm Jokers were already utilized this round.\n\nLooking at my hand: I've got a King of Spades, a 5 of Spades, a 10 of Hearts, a 2 of Hearts, a King of Clubs, and three 10 of Diamonds. My previous hand, position 7, was a 10 of Diamonds as well.\n\nMy target is 472 chips. The Joker multiplier is calculated as: 4 (Base) + 10 (Mail-In Rebate) + 10 (Ride the Bus) = 24. My total Joker chips are 102 (from Blue Joker).  If I play a single 10 of Diamonds, my total chips will be: 35 (Base) + 10 (Card) + 102 (Blue Joker) = 147. My estimated score will be 147 * 24 = 3528. This should easily exceed the required 472.\n\nPlaying a single card also keeps \"Ride the Bus\" adding more mult. Right now it adds +10, but the description clearly says +1 for consecutive hands played without a face card.\n\nSince I am playing a single card, it triggers before the scoring. So, my calculations are:\n\nMult: 4 + 10 + 11 = 25.\nChips: 35 + 10 + 102 = 147.\nScore: 147 * 25 = 3675.\n\nThis is a surefire win, and 3675 is > 472.\n\nI will play a single 10 of Diamonds in position 7.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [7]"}
