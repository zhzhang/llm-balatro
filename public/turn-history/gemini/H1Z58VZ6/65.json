{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: The Blind Ahead**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 3/8, Big Blind at 3000 chips – we're in Round 8. I've got $9. The immediate goal is to maximize the impact of DNA and Brainstorm. The key is to find that elusive Purple Seal 10 of Diamonds – the *only* card I want.\n\nMy hand currently contains: 10 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 7 of Spades, Queen of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, and 4 of Diamonds. The core of my strategy hinges on getting that 10 of Diamonds into play as the only card. Since it wasn't in the hand, I have to *discard*.\n\nI have four discards, which is crucial. I also have the DNA and Brainstorm Jokers. DNA creates a copy if my *first* play is a single card. Brainstorm copies the leftmost Joker (which is DNA). If I find and play the 10 of Diamonds, that card will be duplicated by the DNA/Brainstorm trigger.\n\nNow, my initial instinct is to play a High Card, as it would easily clear the blind if I just played what I had. Playing High Card (level 2: 15 chips, 2 mult) would get 2337, well below the goal. I *could* score 2337 this hand, but I'm looking at optimizing. It's tempting, but it's not the *optimal* path.\n\nThe current hand's High Card play, at level 2, would give a base of 15 x 2 (mult), + 10 (card rank) and the Blue Joker (98) = 123. If I did that, the score would be 123 x 19 (including Holo Rebate and Ride the Bus) = 2337. Not ideal. The long-term game is better.\n\nThe optimal play is to play a single 10 of Diamonds after discarding.\n\nThe important point is Ride the Bus. Ride the Bus has +7 mult and increases if no face cards are scored.\n\nThe hand does *not* contain the target card. Therefore, I'm going to discard the Queen (face card, risks Ride the Bus). Discarding 10S, 8S, 7S and 10H also since they aren't the Purple Seal I want. I'm choosing to discard the Queen (bad for Ride the Bus) and the 10s as I want the Purple Seal 10 of Diamonds to create an additional two.\n\nI'm discarding the Queen of Hearts (index 4) and 10 of Spades (index 1), 8 of Spades (index 2), 7 of Spades (index 3), and 10 of Hearts (index 5) to dig. No Jacks to worry about Mail-In Rebate, and no face cards to worry about Ride the Bus. Since I have 3 hands to work with, it's optimal to discard 5.\n\nLet's verify the positions:\n1: 10S\n2: 8S\n3: 7S\n4: QH\n5: 10H\n6: 5H\n7: 9C\n8: 4D\n\nIt checks out. The optimal move here is to discard those five cards. The goal is to maximize the DNA/Brainstorm combo.\n\nI should verify the 10 of Diamonds card (Purple Seal) is in the deck. It should be.\n\nFinal JSON: `{\"action\":\"discard\",\"positions\":[1,2,3,4,5]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
