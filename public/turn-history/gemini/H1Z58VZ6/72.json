{"reasoning":"**Prioritizing High Card Leveling in the Shop**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: It's Ante 3/8, Round 8, and I'm in the SHOP phase with $25 in the bank. My inventory's looking decent, but I need to focus on optimizing my scaling strategy. Currently, the High Card is my primary scoring engine, and I need to level it up. I'm running with DNA, Brainstorm (copying DNA), a Blue Joker (+118 chips), Mail-In Rebate (+10 Mult), and Ride the Bus (+9 Mult), as well as a Death consumable. The goal is to keep Ride the Bus active by avoiding face cards.\n\nThe key to leveling High Card right now is the Telescope voucher. Because I've played High Card eight times, Celestial Packs *always* contain the Pluto planet card, which directly levels up High Card. Right now, both Celestial Packs are available for $3 each, a bargain! \"The High Priestess\" is also available, but the guaranteed planet card from the Celestial Packs is a much higher priority.\n\nTherefore, the ideal move here is to buy both Celestial Packs as fast as possible. This action is `buy_booster 1`, followed by `buy_booster 2`. Afterward, I’ll pick up \"The High Priestess\" to keep my options open. This will advance the round to the next blind.\n\nBuying these Celestial Packs is the highest priority. Telescope is currently active, and guarantees the planets I need. This will level up my key hand, High Card, and improve the base scoring of my deck. I have plenty of money, and it's a solid, reasoned move that I can execute with confidence. The underlying JSON schema checks out, and the reasoning is sound - I am making a solid move.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
