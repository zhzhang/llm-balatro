{"reasoning":"**The Calculus of Cardplay**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 3/8, Round 9. Boss Blind: The Wheel – always fun. I need 4000 chips, and I've got a trio of hands to get there. Currently at zero chips, but this is entirely manageable.\n\nI've got a few key Jokers in play: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. My aim here is to maximize my chip generation, and particularly to trigger those DNA and Brainstorm Jokers. DNA copies the *first* card played *only if* it’s the *first* hand of the round, then Brainstorm copies it once more. I need to make the best use of this.\n\nLooking at my hand, I see a King of Spades, a 5 of Spades, a 10 of Hearts, a 2 of Hearts, a King of Clubs, an unknown card, and two 10 of Diamonds. “Ride the Bus” will be a factor, so I need to be careful with face cards. That will boost my multiplier with each consecutive hand that doesn't include scoring face cards. I need to trigger DNA; my best candidate is one of the 10 of Diamonds. They are also enhanced, which is good.\n\nI have to carefully evaluate the cards to play. I'm going to play a single non-face card to trigger DNA/Brainstorm and scale \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nI’ll begin by playing the 10 of Diamonds (Position 7). The 10 of Diamonds has an enhancement, and its description says that, when discarded, it creates a Tarot card. This seems valuable to copy.\n\nI know the Joker order is: DNA (first), Brainstorm (second). Brainstorm will copy DNA, as planned. DNA should trigger because this is the first hand and I'm playing a single card. And \"Ride the Bus\" should trigger because I am not scoring a face card.\n\nSo, for score calculation: the hand is a High Card, which levels at 4 for 35 chips and 4 mult. The 10 of Diamonds card itself adds 10 chips, and the Blue Joker adds 102. That's a total of 147 chips. For the multiplier, I have the base of 4, a bonus of 10 from Mail-In Rebate, and 9 from \"Ride the Bus.\" That's a multiplier of 23. My score is 147 * 23, which equals 3381 chips.\n\nWait. Is it a Lucky card? Let me re-examine the card. The provided text for the 10 of Diamonds clearly states \"Creates a Tarot card when discarded.\" That is a good, specific property. OK, I should be fine.\n\nI need 4000, and this gives me 3381. Close, and two hands left, this will be easy.\n\nSo, action is `play`, card is position `7`, with a `high card` hand, and an estimated score of 3381.\n\nNow, let's play.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [7]"}
