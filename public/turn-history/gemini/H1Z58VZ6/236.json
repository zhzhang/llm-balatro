{"reasoning":"**Balatro Decision: Celestial Pack - Pluto Selection**\n\nOkay, I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` phase of Balatro. Ante 6/8, round 20. The current objective is crystal clear: select a planet card from the Celestial Pack. My focus is laser-sharp – I'm optimizing for my High Card strategy.\n\nLooking at the options, Pluto is the obvious choice. It levels up High Card with a +1 Mult and +10 chips, and High Card is already at level 11 and has been played 28 times. With my Telescope voucher ensuring Pluto's presence and my current Joker setup – DNA, Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker – I'm well-positioned to leverage this upgrade. DNA and Brainstorm are working well together to get steel non-face cards into play, a good strategy for scaling.\n\nSo, the best play is to select Pluto (position 1 in the pack) to directly level up the High Card hand.\n\nI need to generate a JSON response, per the instructions, but let's check the schema again, to be thorough.\n\nThe target for my action is null, because this is a pack item selection, not a hand card. The schema allows null for `intended_hand_type`, and my estimated chips are, therefore, also null.\n\nThe task is to maximize the score. My action is *select*, my position is 1 (Pluto). There is no reason to rearrange Jokers or use consumables first.\n\nLet's double-check the command is `select` and that I am picking from the \"Celestial Pack\". The command `select` is used to pick a card from the pack, and I've verified the pack and position again.\n\nThe instructions stipulate the format: `select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> ...`. I need just the pack position, which is 1 (Pluto).\n\nI need to generate a JSON string. I will verify one last time that I do not generate any comments or control tokens.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"action\":\"select\",\"positions\":[1],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
