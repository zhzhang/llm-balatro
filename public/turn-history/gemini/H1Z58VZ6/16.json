{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decision: Ride the Bus**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking. Ante 2, shop phase, $6 in the bank. I'm looking at my options, primarily focused on building a solid foundation for the run. I have the Mail-In Rebate (Holo) joker, which is fantastic for flat mult (+10), and a Telescope voucher. My Three of a Kind is leveled to 2 (50 Chips, 5 Mult).\n\nThe shop offers a few choices: a Square Joker, Ride the Bus, and a Mega Standard Pack. The pack is out of reach at $8. The Square Joker grants +4 chips if I play a four-card hand, while the Ride the Bus provides scaling mult by avoiding scoring face cards. I'm currently leaning towards Three of a Kind, which uses 3 cards.\n\nMy immediate constraint is the $6 available. Spending $4 on Square Joker gives me $2, while $6 on Ride the Bus leaves me with $0. Holding the $6 grants $1 interest.\n\nThe key question: Is the Ride the Bus worth skipping the dollar? I believe in early scaling. Ride the Bus has the potential to become a strong engine, especially when paired with my existing Mail-In Rebate, which offers good initial mult. The Square Joker offers chips. I could play a four-card hand to trigger Square Joker, but it is not optimal for Three of a Kind.\n\nRemembering my previous analysis, I had intended to buy the Ride the Bus. My reasoning is that this scaling mult will be more useful in the long run. I also confirmed that Ride the Bus is triggered by *scoring* face cards, and I can avoid those.\n\nSo, the optimal move is `buy_card 2`. I re-confirm that the shop indices are correct: Square Joker is at index 1 and Ride the Bus is at index 2. This purchase leaves me with 2 Jokers. Mail-In Rebate is good initial mult, and Ride the Bus offers scaling.\n\nI double-checked my constraints: I have the money, the card costs $6, and the action is `buy_card 2`. I went back and considered the Square Joker, but the Ride the Bus ultimately provides a more valuable scaling joker. The schema requires the \"action\" and \"positions\" parameters.\n\nMy action: `buy_card`\nPositions: `[2]`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
