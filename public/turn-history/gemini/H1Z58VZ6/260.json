{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Steps**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7, Round 22, in the shop phase. I've got $29. My current Jokers are looking strong: DNA (foil), Brainstorm (copying DNA), Steel Joker (X3.2 mult), Ride the Bus (+32 mult), and Blue Joker (+174 chips). The \"The Tower\" consumable is ready, which is nice for Stone cards. My High Card level is already at 14. My main strategy now is maximizing my High Card to beat the remaining blinds in Ante 7 and prepare for Ante 8.\n\nLet's see what the shop has. Mystic Summit gives +15 Mult when zero discards remain, but with Ride the Bus, it's not better than what I have. Justice is interesting—it enhances a card into a Glass Card, doubling its mult, with a chance of destruction. I already have Steel Joker, DNA, and the consumables slot available, but this requires me to select a card in my hand, and I can't do that here.\n\nMy goal is to find Pluto or good Tarot cards. I can't buy any packs, and I have Telescope, so I'll be set to get Pluto.\n\nI've got a solid combo right now: DNA, Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker. The Tower is a solid consumable for extra chips, and a single Stone card would be fantastic, since Stone cards don't count as face cards (preserving Ride the Bus) and provide flat chips. I am right on the edge of beating the Big Blind in one hand.\n\nBuying Justice ($2) for my consumable slot looks like a solid move. It could give me a valuable x2 mult later on. I'll have $27 left, which is still good for interest. Rerolling is too expensive at $7, so that's out. Moving on to the next round is the play.\n\nI need to confirm the shop items. Mystic Summit is in slot 1 and Justice is in slot 2. So, I will buy Justice. I'll have $27 left after buying the card. I'll preserve my interest and progress in the game by buying Justice and moving to the next round. I'm choosing \"buy\\_card\" with position \"2\".\n\nI'll buy Justice, the consumables are fine. Then, I can select the next round. It is a no-brainer to buy Justice. I'm now certain, I can buy Justice and then select the next round. I have max interest.\n\nMy final decision is to execute `buy_card` with positions [2].\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
