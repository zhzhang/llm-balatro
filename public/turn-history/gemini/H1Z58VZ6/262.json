{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Blind and the Boss: A Strategic Evaluation**\n\nOkay, Ante 7, Round 22, time to make some decisions. This Big Blind, requiring 52,500 chips for a $4 reward, presents a classic dilemma. The \"Ethereal Tag\" offers a Spectral Pack if I skip, but the reward of $4 and the shop phase are tempting. I'm currently at $27, and my build is *very* heavily invested in High Card, which is Level 14, worth 135 chips and 14 multiplier.\n\nMy initial thought was to play the blind for the money and the chance at the shop. The \"Ride the Bus\" scaling is a good thing to keep going, and the shop might offer a Planet card like Telescope or a useful Joker/Consumable to deal with the upcoming Boss: \"The Eye\" – which is the biggest concern. \"The Eye\" has the nasty restriction of \"no repeat hand types\" this round. I can't rely solely on my High Card. Rerolling the boss is an option, costing $10, which leaves me at $17 and below the interest cap, but I can't reroll for free without Director's Cut!\n\nBut wait, I have Director's Cut! I can play the blind and access the shop, with the option to reroll the boss in the shop. The shop is crucial for either finding a Planet card or finding some way to survive the boss.\n\nSo, I need to check the boss again: \"No repeat hand types\". This is a huge issue since my main hand is High Card. I did a quick check: One High Card hand can give me ~52k points, and I can have a nice amount for one more hand like Pair or Three of a Kind. I can beat the boss without rerolling it!\n\nNow, how should I play the hand? I have DNA and Brainstorm. The first hand will be a single card to trigger DNA and have two cards (with Brainstorm). I can use these cards to scale Steel cards thanks to my Steel Joker.\n\nAction: `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
