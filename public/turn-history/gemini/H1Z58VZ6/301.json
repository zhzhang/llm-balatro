{"reasoning":"**The Decision at Ante 8**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 26. Shop phase. My goal is clear: beat the boss and win this game. The High Card strategy is dominant, and I've got a strong setup going. I have $26.\n\nI've got a killer combo: DNA (Foil, copying the first card played) and Brainstorm (Holo, cloning the leftmost Joker – currently DNA). Plus, Ride the Bus (+36 Mult for playing hands without face cards), a Steel Joker (X4.2 Mult due to all the Steel cards in my deck), and a Blue Joker (+200 Chips based on deck composition). I also have \"The Tower,\" which I can use to make a card a Stone card in the round phase. I have Hieroglyph, Petroglyph, Telescope and Planet Merchant active.\n\nThe shop cards are useless: Scary Face and Earth. I'm playing High Card, so those are non-starters. Rerolling costs $6, which would leave me with $20. Should I risk it? I *could* hunt for a Pluto card (Telescope active) or Tarot pack for those sweet Steel cards, but the deck's already strong.\n\nI'm thinking about the interest. I have $26, and I'll get $5 interest at the end of the round. At $26, I'm at the interest cap, so there's no real benefit to holding the money. What can I buy? No boosters or vouchers.\n\nLet's do a quick score estimation. High Card at Level 16 gives me 155 chips and 16 Mult. My Jokers add a ton: DNA (+50 chips), Brainstorm (+10 Mult), Ride the Bus (+36 Mult), Steel Joker (X4.2 Mult), and Blue Joker (+200 chips). With 3 Steel cards in hand, I can achieve a significant score.\n\nIf I play a High Card that is NOT a face card, \"Ride the Bus\" is perfect for my strategy.\n\nOkay, is it worth a reroll at this stage? I don't see anything obvious to buy. It's Ante 8, the last leg of the game. Considering the money/reroll cost, I'm going to select `round_select`. My current hand is solid. There's no clear benefit to rerolling or spending more money.\n\nDNA should be played before Brainstorm, as I want the first played card cloned.\n\nOkay, just making sure, with `round_select` - let's make it happen. I will double check the descriptions. Steel cards give X1.5 and the Steel Joker scales with the number of them in the deck.\n\nI've got this. Action: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
