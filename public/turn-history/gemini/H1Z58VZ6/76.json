{"reasoning":"**The Shop Phase: A Calculated Pass**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop after snagging a Pluto card – nice! Ante 3, Round 8. Money's at $19. I'm thinking about maximizing that sweet, sweet interest. Currently at $3, but if I can push to $20, it jumps to $4 – that's a decent return, especially this late in the run.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty solid: DNA, Brainstorm (copying DNA), Blue Joker (massive chips!), Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. Ride the Bus is particularly key for this High Card deck. It's built for consistency.\n\nThe shop offers \"The High Priestess\" for $2. It creates two random Planet cards. The Telescope Voucher I have and the focused build I am going for makes it tempting but, is a bit of a gamble, even if it is a cheap gamble. I can only hold one card. I also have a Death consumable, so I would only be able to acquire one of the planets from the High Priestess. The main issue is that random planets could be useless. But it's $2 - so low risk. Still, I have to weigh losing a Death slot to a random Planet, and the potential value.\n\nI am not building a pure planet deck.\n\nRerolling is an option, but at $5, it's a bit pricey right now, considering interest. I'm probably better off saving the money.\n\nNext round is a Boss Blind, and I'm currently set up for the current blind.\n\nNow, a quick check on the consumables. The Death card could be useful in the future, so I'll hold onto it. The Death card is much more valuable than one random planet.\n\nThe Jokers are in a good arrangement for the initial hand: DNA in slot 1 and Brainstorm in slot 2. Since DNA creates a copy of the first card played in a round, and Brainstorm copies the leftmost Joker, this means my first hand gets doubled (or 3x'd with the copy from Brainstorm). This setup is excellent for deck thinning.\n\nShould I buy \"The High Priestess\"? The money's a consideration - it's $2, versus the $3 interest I have.\nThis is a low-risk move.\nBut since I can only get one planet. The random Planet is probably not worth losing the spot on the consumable slot.\n\nAnd I am skipping round_select.\nGoing to round select.\n\nFinal thoughts: I'm going to pass on \"The High Priestess\" and keep the $19, and go for that next $4 interest.\n\nOkay, let's go.\nAction: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
