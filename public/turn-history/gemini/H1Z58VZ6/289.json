{"reasoning":"**My Calculated Play: The Hierophant for High Card Supremacy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8/8, Round 25. I've got $13 and a Tarot Pack to work with. My core strategy is a High Card build, level 16, with a solid supporting cast of Jokers – DNA (foil), Brainstorm (holo), Ride the Bus (+35 mult), Steel Joker (x3.8), and Blue Joker (+172). The goal is the Big Blind (75k) and the Boss (100k - Crimson Heart). I'm carrying The Tower, but that's a consumable for later.\n\nThe choices in this pack are: The World (Spades conversion - useless here), The Hierophant (2 Bonus cards - my potential play), and The Lovers (Wild card - doesn't help my scaling strategy).\n\nLooking at my hand: Ace Spades, King Hearts (Steel), 10 Hearts (Foil), 5 Hearts (Steel), Ace Clubs, Ace Diamonds (Gold), Ace Diamonds (Gold), Ace Diamonds (Gold), 10 Diamonds (Mult). My Steel Joker is key with 14 Steel cards in the deck, granting it x3.8. I have the option to reroll the boss if needed (but I shouldn't need to).\n\nThe Hierophant looks most promising. I can enhance two cards with +30 chips each. If the Crimson Heart Boss disables Blue Joker, that extra chip boost will be crucial. I calculated the High Card potential with this hand:\n\n*   Without any Hierophant play: ~101,300.\n*   With Hierophant applying a bonus to two Ace cards: ~96,892.\n\nThe Hierophant is the only choice that provides a tangible (if small) benefit to the score.\n\nSo, I'm selecting The Hierophant (position 2) and targeting the Ace of Spades (position 1) and the Ace of Clubs (position 5). I've double-checked the schema, the card positions, and the money situation. Everything checks out. I have $13, which is enough to comfortably deal with this decision, and booster selection is free. I considered using 'The Tower' but I have that in inventory. I must act now.\nI've considered all the cards, and I am not taking the 10 of Diamonds, as it's already a mult card. I will pick the Ace of Spades and the Ace of Clubs.\nMy final, calculated move: Select the Hierophant (position 2) and target the Ace of Spades (position 1) and the Ace of Clubs (position 5).\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,5]"}
