{"reasoning":"**My Balatro Shop Phase: Pluto's My Priority**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 6, Round 20, $51 in the bank. I'm focusing on my High Card build, heavily leveraging \"Ride the Bus\" (no face cards) and scaling \"Steel Joker\" through \"DNA\" and \"Brainstorm.\" The deck's pretty hefty at around 82 cards, which helps my \"Blue Joker\" for chips. My High Card is at Level 10, so leveling it further is top priority.\n\nI've got a killer Joker lineup: DNA and Brainstorm (copying power!), Steel Joker for that sweet multiplier, Ride the Bus adding raw mult, and Blue Joker adding some nice chips. I also have \"High Priestess\" and \"The Tower\" as consumables.\n\nLooking at the Shop, I see the \"Jumbo Celestial Pack\" and the \"Celestial Pack\", both guaranteed to contain Pluto thanks to my Telescope voucher, since High Card is my most played hand. I'll take advantage of that. The \"Burglar\" is tempting with +3 hands, but I'm hesitant to lose my discards, especially with some purple seals in play. The \"Business Card\" is a hard pass since it gives money for face cards, which I'm actively avoiding with \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nThe immediate play is clear: I need to get those Pluto planet upgrades. I also need to clear a consumable slot for future consumables. My first move: Let's use High Priestess. So it's:\n\n`{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\nThen, I'll buy and use the packs, getting me closer to leveling my High Card!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
