{"reasoning":"**Round 17 Shop Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 17, Ante 5/8, and I've got $47 to work with in the SHOP phase. Let's break down what I'm looking at.\n\nMy Joker lineup is pretty solid, but could be better. I've got DNA (that's crucial for my cloning strategy), Brainstorm (essential to have, since it copies DNA), Ride the Bus (decent +25 Mult, given my no-face-card focus), the Blue Joker (+158 Chips, deck size), and Steel Joker (X2 Mult, scales on Steel cards, which is the cornerstone). My High Card level is already at 9 with 85 chips and 9 Mult. \n\nMy current plan, as always, revolves around High Card, Steel, and DNA cloning, leaning heavily into my Steel cards for scaling. The DNA and Brainstorm Jokers are perfectly positioned at slots 1 and 2, which is optimal.\n\nNow, the shop: Hack and Sly Joker are available. Hack is a definite pass – it retriggers 2, 3, 4, 5, which doesn't fit my core cards. Sly Joker only adds value if I'm playing Pairs which I'm not. The shop offers nothing beneficial for my strategy, so I have to be picky here.\n\nThe upcoming Boss Blind is *likely* \"The Needle\", based on the logs, and I want to be prepared, even if it's not explicitly named.\n\nI have $47 to spend, but I need to find better options. I'm really hoping to get some more Planets, specifically Pluto, for that High Card synergy, or possibly a Joker that can offer more chip-based or X-Mult multipliers. Blue Joker and Ride the Bus are serviceable, but I know I can do better.\n\nSo, I'm going to reroll the shop. The reroll cost is $6, which I can easily afford. I'm hoping for some Planets or Jokers that align better with my build.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
