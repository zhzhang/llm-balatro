{"reasoning":"**Focusing on the DNA Brainstorm Combo**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 3/8, Round 6. The goal here is still to maximize the score and build the deck. I've got $7 and the shop has some interesting options. Right now, I'm holding Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, and DNA, with DNA sitting in the crucial position 4. I've also picked up Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale vouchers and the Egg and Brainstorm cards are available to buy, along with Jumbo Arcana and Jumbo Celestial boosters.\n\nThe immediate priority has got to be getting Brainstorm. I have enough money, and it will give the deck a tremendous boost. That was the plan from previous turns. Brainstorm is $7, and I have $7. Easy choice, right?\n\nThe most critical part here is positioning Brainstorm to copy DNA. Because Brainstorm duplicates the *leftmost* Joker, DNA has to be in the first slot after purchase. So the immediate next action has to be a joker rearrangement. I'm going to need to rearrange my Jokers after this.\n\nOkay, I'm buying Brainstorm and immediately after, rearranging the Jokers. No point in wasting any further time on other choices right now. Buying Brainstorm means I'm out of cash immediately. Jumbo boosters and Egg are off the table for this round. I can't even reroll. It's all about that double DNA trigger, which will flood the deck with copies of the played card. That's a huge multiplier and makes this buy the right choice.\n\nAction: `buy_card 2` (Brainstorm) – and then, rearrange!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
