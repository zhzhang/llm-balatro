{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Round 14**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 14, Ante 5/8. My goal is 16,500 chips, and I currently have 8,496, leaving me 8,004 to go. I've only got three hands left, and three discards. I also have $25 to work with.\n\nI've got a couple of Gold Aces (at indices 8 and 9) that will give me $6 at the end of the round if I hold them, so I should remember to do that.\n\nHere's my hand setup:\n\n1.  \"Ride the Bus\" is at +20 Mult, it increases with each non-face card hand, and I want to keep that going.\n2.  \"Brainstorm\" is copying \"Ride the Bus.\"\n3.  \"Blue Joker\" is at +120 chips, so it's good value.\n4.  \"Mail-In Rebate\" is Holo and provides +10 Mult, and earns $5 for discarded 7s.\n5.  \"DNA\" is Foil and provides +50 chips. It won't clone anything this turn because it is not the first hand of the round.\n\nI've got: Ace of Spades (Lucky), Ace of Hearts (Lucky), 10 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds (Wild), Ace of Diamonds (Gold), Ace of Diamonds (Gold).\n\nI can play a High Card, with Ride the Bus at +20 Mult, Brainstorm at +20, and Mail-In Rebate at +10, giving me 56 Multiplier, and base 6 mult (High Card Level 6).\n\nThe total chips for a non-face card is 225 + Rank = 235 if I use a 10. The 10 of Hearts (position 3) or the 10 of Diamonds (position 7) both work. I can use the 10 of Hearts and keep the Lucky Aces.\n\nSo, 235 chips * 56 mult = 13,160. That's well over the 8,004 I need. Holding the Gold Aces for the $6 is a good move. I can also discard the 10 of Hearts and replay it if needed.\n\nLet's double check the Joker order is still good: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, DNA.\n\n1.  Base High Card: 55 chips, 6 mult.\n2.  Played card: 10 of Hearts (10 chips).\n3.  Joker Chips: Blue Joker (+120), DNA (+50).\n4.  Joker Mult: Ride the Bus (+20), Brainstorm (+20), Mail-In Rebate (+10).\n    Total Chips = 55 + 10 + 120 + 50 = 235.\n    Total Mult = 6 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 56.\n    Total Score = 235 * 56 = 13,160.\n\nThis is a winning hand. This will increase the Ride the Bus counter by 1. I'll get some interest and money from the gold cards.\n\nOkay, let's play the 10 of Hearts at position 3.\n\n`{\"action\": \"play\", \"positions\": [3], \"intended_hand_type\": \"high card\", \"estimated_chips\": 13160}`\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3]"}
