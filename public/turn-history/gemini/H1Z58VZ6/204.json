{"reasoning":"**The Shop and Joker Optimization**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm at Ante 6, sitting pretty with $13, and this shop is… less than ideal. I've got a solid High Card strategy going, with a focus on Steel Joker synergy, but these shop cards aren't adding much. Stone Joker is a hard pass, and Green Joker is too slow and conflicts with discards. The Arcana pack is already used. Rerolling is tempting, but that $5 could be better spent on interest or a juicier shop. The question now is: do I risk it, or do I proceed?\n\nI've got the essentials in place. Steel Joker and Brainstorm are the core of the mult, Ride the Bus is the multiplier, DNA for chips, and Blue Joker for more chips. High card is a level 9. The current setup offers a solid base, but I need to maximize what I have. My current mult is (9 + 26) * 2.2 * 2.2, which is good enough, but I want to make sure the Joker order is optimized.\n\nThe key is Brainstorm. It's copying the *leftmost* Joker. If I move Ride the Bus to the left of the X mult Jokers, I get an interesting situation. If Ride the Bus is in position 1, Brainstorm copies it. That results in (9 + 26 + 26) * 2.2, which is better than my current setup. I need to make sure I add *before* multiplying. I can rearrange the Jokers to: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm, Steel. Then it's: (Base + Bus + Brainstorm (Bus)) * Steel. That's optimal. And then DNA + Blue Joker.\n\nTherefore, the best play is to buy nothing, and advance to the round. The next thing to check is the joker order:\n1.  Ride the Bus\n2.  Brainstorm\n3.  Steel Joker\n4.  DNA\n5.  Blue Joker\n\nWith this order, I should hit the round and move onto the next.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
