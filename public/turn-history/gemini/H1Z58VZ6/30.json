{"reasoning":"**Balatro Strategy: Blind Select Analysis**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. It's Round 3, Ante 3/8, and I'm looking at the Small Blind. I've got $7 and a decent hand setup.\n\nI have five Joker slots filled, and here are my jokers: Mail-In Rebate (holo +10 Mult, $5 for discarding 7s), Ride the Bus (+2 Mult, gains +1 per non-face hand), Red Card (+6 Mult, gains +3 per skipped booster), Blue Joker (+104 Chips), and Scholar (+20 Chips, +4 Mult per Ace). I also have a consumable, The Magician (Enhance 2 cards to Lucky), and the Telescope voucher.\n\nMy current goal is to reach 2000 chips. The Small Blind requires 2000 chips to win.\n\nMy initial thoughts are: I can either play the round, skip for a Top-up Tag (which is useless since my slots are full), sell Magician for $1, or sell a Joker. I cannot use the consumable during Blind Select.\n\nThe Top-up Tag gives me up to 2 common jokers, but that's pointless with full slots. Playing the round gives $3 plus a small interest and the value of any hands remaining. With $7, I am already earning $1 interest. Finishing with more than $8 will give $2 interest (assuming I don't spend).\n\nMy scoring potential is decent: Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, Red Card, and Ride the Bus. My total static Mult is 18. Base chips for a Three of a Kind is 50 + 104 = 154. This means 154 * 23 = 3542. So, a good hand will easily clear 2000 chips.\n\nTherefore, playing the round is the correct action. It provides money (crucial for future boosters) and the chance to scale. Skipping the round is not viable. There is no point in selling any Joker now.\n\nI reviewed the joker ordering again but the current order: Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Red Card, Blue Joker, and Scholar, is optimized. Chips from Blue Joker and Scholar will contribute to the total first. After, additive mult values won't affect the hand strength relative to one another.\n\nMy estimated hand type is Three of a Kind. Assuming I play three of a kind, my initial estimated total is 3542 chips. Accounting for Aces in my intended Three of a Kind, I get 7490 chips.\n\nThe final action is: `\"play_round\"`. The intended hand is Three of a Kind. The estimated chips are 3542.\n\nI need to make sure my final output is valid JSON, no comments, no control tokens, and a single object.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n```json\n{\"action\":\"play_round\",\"intended_hand_type\":\"three of a kind\",\"estimated_chips\":3542}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
