{"reasoning":"**Deep Dive: Strategic Play for Maximum Value**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 11. Big Blind, 7500 chips needed. I'm in the SELECTING_HAND phase. Let's break this down. My goal is to maximize my score and build my deck long-term.\n\nI have some key jokers in play.  DNA (Rare), Brainstorm (Rare), Blue Joker (Common), Mail-In Rebate (Holo, Common), and Ride the Bus (Common). Consumables are Death and The Chariot (Steel).\n\nMy current hand has a decent spread: Jack of Spades, Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, Queen of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 10 of Diamonds (Wild, Tarot), 8 of Diamonds, and 4 of Diamonds.\n\nThe crux of my strategy revolves around the DNA and Brainstorm combo.  DNA triggers if the *first hand* of the round has only *one* card, and Brainstorm copies it. This is my chance to create some real value.  I *must* use this to duplicate the 10 of Diamonds which says \"Creates a Tarot card when discarded\".\n\nSo, I need to evaluate the most valuable card to duplicate. The 10 of Diamonds is an obvious choice. It's a \"Wild Card\" that generates Tarot cards on discard.  I could use Death to transform a weaker card, but DNA copies the *played* card. Since the 10 of Diamonds is Wild, I want to use it right away.  Ride the Bus is another consideration; I can increase the value by *not* playing Face Cards. However, I can still use the +13 mult from Ride the Bus, so it won't impact this play.\n\nI also have \"Mail-In Rebate\" (+10 Mult), the rank changes every round. But I'm not discarding this round, I am *playing*, so the rank is irrelevant.\n\nLet's do some quick score calculations. With the current jokers: Base High Card score is (45 chips, 5 Mult).\n\nBlue Joker: +112 chips, and Ride the Bus with +13 Mult, and +10 Mult from the Holo \"Mail-In Rebate.\"\nTotal Mult = 5 (base) + 10 (Holo) + 13 (Ride the Bus) = 28.\nTotal Chips = 45 (base) + 112 (Blue Joker) + 10 (card value) = 167\nScore = 167 * 28 = 4676.  This isn't enough to hit the 7500, but I'm looking at longer-term deck building. \n\nThe 10 of Diamonds creates Tarots on discard. This is a game changer. The Ace of Hearts is Lucky (+20 Mult), but it's secondary to the value of the 10. The 7 of Hearts has +4 Mult, but that is minor compared to the Wild and Tarot generation. I want to build a deck of strong Tarot cards.\n\nNow, let's verify everything.  I'll play one card, the 10 of Diamonds.  This will trigger DNA and Brainstorm. That's two more 10 of Diamonds in the deck and my hand. The position of 10 of Diamonds is at 6.\n\nI'm confident in my chip calculation and my Joker configuration. DNA must be at the beginning for this. It is a one card play to trigger DNA.\n\nI'm checking the mail-in rebate value, since I am in a state to play a hand and generate score. So the mail-in rebate is irrelevant, as it will always give a +10 mult and triggers at the start of the round.\n\nThe 7 of Hearts Mult is +4. I have no more reasons to use a consumable here.  The Ride the Bus joker also won't reset (since I am playing a non-face card), which will be +1 to the next round. The Blue Joker value is correct at 112 because of the deck size.\n\nAfter carefully examining all aspects, including the position of the Jokers, I am ready.\n\nHere's my calculated action to take next:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [6],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"high card\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 4676\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [6]"}
