{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Mega Pack for Optimal Deck Enhancement**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 5/8, Round 12. I'm looking at a Mega Standard Pack here, with $37 in the bank. My Joker lineup is solid: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. My current hand strategy is High Card, currently at level 6.\n\nLet's break down these card choices. I have: a 9 of Spades with a Purple Seal that creates a Tarot on discard, a 7 of Hearts also with a Purple Seal that also creates a Tarot on discard, an 8 of Hearts Gold Card that earns $3 when played/scores, a regular King of Hearts, and a Steel 2 of Spades that provides a x1.5 Mult.\n\nGiven my High Card strategy, and the Jokers I have, those Purple Seals are absolutely golden. DNA and Brainstorm can double-copy, meaning I can build a discard-heavy deck that generates consistent Tarots. Blue Joker scales with deck size, Mail-In Rebate gives cash for discarded ranks, and Ride the Bus scales with consecutive hands without face cards. The Seals are far more valuable than the Steel card or the King of Hearts. The King of Hearts breaks Ride the Bus, so it's out. The Gold Card's value is often lower than what the Purple Seals generate through Tarot cards.\n\nThis is a Mega pack, so I get to select two cards. The Purple Seals are the clear winners here. They'll let me continuously generate Tarots, which I can use to level up my hands and enhance my deck. Both Purple Seals are non-face cards, maintaining \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nI'll pick one now. The 9 of Spades with the Purple Seal looks like a solid starting point. I can pick up the other one later. The current plan is to take these Purple Seals, copy them with DNA/Brainstorm, generate Tarots, and continue leveling up and further enhancing my deck.\n\nSo, I'll select the 9 of Spades (position 1). The next turn I'll take the other Purple Seal.\n\nTherefore, my action is `select`, the positions are `[1]`. My `intended_hand_type` is null, as I'm not playing a hand, and my `estimated_chips` are also null.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
