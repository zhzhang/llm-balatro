{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Maximizing Value**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The goal is to beat the current blind of 1600 with only three hands remaining and I have an estimated score of 1824. My hand contains two Aces, and a lot of supporting cards. It's the first hand of the round, so DNA is active, meaning the first card I play will be copied and added to the deck.\n\nI've got the \"Magician\" consumable which will enhance two cards to \"Lucky Cards\" (+20 Mult, $20 chance). I need to figure out the best sequence here. If I can get the Magician on the two Aces before playing the single card and trigger the DNA, I get an enhanced copy of the Ace into my deck. I'm prioritizing the long-term value of a Lucky Ace for my future plays here.\n\nMy gut says using the consumable is the right move right now. It won't hurt my guaranteed score of 1824, and with the \"Ride the Bus\" and \"Mail-In Rebate\" joker effects, it'll be a solid play. Given the game state I'm currently at, I only have one discard left, and I could discard cards to get a two for the Mail-In, but I really want the Lucky Ace, so the Magician is the top priority. There isn't any reason to do a \"play\" at this time, since that's not the first step I want to take.\n\nMy calculations have checked out and I will use the Magician on the two Aces in my hand. It is going to be a simple turn, with the primary objective being using the consumable to enhance the two aces in my hand. With this, I will take the action of `use_consumable` with arguments `[1, 1, 4]`. That's it. It's all decided!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,1,4]"}
