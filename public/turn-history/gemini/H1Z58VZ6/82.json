{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase of the Jumbo Celestial Pack, specifically focused on maximizing my chip count to stay ahead of the escalating Antes. My core strategy remains a High Card build, currently at Level 4 and aiming for 10 plays. My inventory is as follows: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. I also have the Hieroglyph, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale Vouchers at my disposal. I’ve got $17 in the bank.\n\nGiven my strategy, the Telescope voucher is key. It ensures Pluto, the High Card booster, appears in the pack, which is exactly what I need. The Booster choices are laid out: Pluto (High Card +1 Mult, +10 Chips, and leveling it from Level 4 to 5), Mars (Four of a Kind), Earth (Full House), Neptune (Straight Flush), and Mercury (Pair).\n\nIt's a no-brainer here. Pluto is the obvious choice. There are no compelling strategic reasons *not* to take Pluto – it directly enhances my primary scoring hand. The selected card is in position 1. The JSON that captures this decision is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON adheres to the expected schema. The action is 'select' and the target card is in the first position. Taking Pluto will progress my current High Card strategy by taking the card in position 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
