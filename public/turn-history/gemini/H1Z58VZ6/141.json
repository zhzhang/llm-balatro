{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 5/8, Round 13. Time to optimize this deck. We have $34, which is comfortably above the $25 interest threshold. Currently, our hand levels are High Card at level 6.\n\nLet's break down the current state: We have five Jokers: `Blue Joker` (+144 chips), `Brainstorm` (copying Blue Joker), `DNA` (+50 chips, foil), `Mail-In Rebate` (+10 mult, holo, $5 per discarded 7), and `Ride the Bus` (+19 mult). We also have the consumables `The Empress` and `The Moon`. Available shop cards are `Showman` ($4) and `Wily Joker` ($3). The shop booster available is the `Jumbo Standard Pack` ($4). Vouchers owned are Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Telescope, Clearance Sale.\n\n`Showman` looks interesting as it allows duplicate Jokers but I'd have to sell a Joker (not happening). `Wily Joker` offers chips for 3-of-a-kind, which isn't useful for High Card. My focus is on scaling High Card. The `Jumbo Standard Pack` is potentially very interesting. Standard packs can offer enhanced cards, and I have `DNA`, which could clone any enhancements.\n\n`Ride the Bus` is great for its scaling mult. `Blue Joker` and `Brainstorm` provide a substantial chip bonus. `Mail-In Rebate` is excellent for mult and economy. `DNA` is key for copying. Let's crunch some numbers. Currently, `Blue Joker` + `Brainstorm` = +288 chips. `DNA` adds +50 chips. Total chips currently = 338. Total mult is 6 (base) + 10 (Rebate) + 19 (Bus) + 4 (Empress if used) = 39. Score = ~11,700 per High Card.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about those consumables. Should I use `The Empress` or `The Moon`? Not in the shop, so that is not an option. I'll save them for now. `The Empress` provides a nice mult bonus. `The Moon` is a suit change, which could be useful if I ever switched to flushes (highly unlikely, but good to keep in mind, and can always be sold later if needed).\n\nWhat about `Showman` again? With this deck, it is not worth selling a joker to make room for it. All Jokers provide useful synergy.\n\nThe key play here is to buy the `Jumbo Standard Pack`. It's only $4. I'll still have $30, maintaining the interest. Let's do that now.\n```\naction: buy_booster\npositions: [1]\n```\nYep, let's confirm the action. I need to use the command `buy_booster <booster_pack_position>`. Position 1 it is! I bought the \"Devil\" tarot from this pack last round. Now I am buying the `Jumbo Standard Pack` again.\n```\naction: buy_booster\npositions: [1]\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
