{"reasoning":"**My Strategy: Ante 1 - Blind Select**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the Big Blind, Ante 1. I already grabbed a Holographic Tag earlier by skipping the Small Blind, which means the next base edition Joker I find will get a +10 Mult boost. Now I'm staring down the barrel of 450 chips for the Big Blind. I've got $4. The reward for the Big Blind is a measly $4, but skipping it gets me a Foil Tag. So, the question is, do I want to skip the Blind and roll the dice on the Boss fight, or play it safe and guarantee a shop?\n\nI'm evaluating my options: Playing the blind is easy; I can get a shop immediately after. This lets me use the Holographic Tag to get a free, +10 Mult Joker, and potentially pick up some economy items. That's the safer play and sets me up for a good start. I can easily make 450 chips with a single strong hand, or even a couple of weaker ones. I can aim for a flush or full house.\n\nSkipping the Big Blind, on the other hand, means I hit the Boss Blind, with its Spades debuff, and only have $5 + $1 (interest) to make plays with. It also means I get a Foil Tag, which is good for +50 chips. It's risky. But, with both tags, I'd get *two* free Jokers in the shop after the Boss.\n\nThe risk is the Boss, 600 chips with a debuff. Can I do it with the starter deck and no Jokers? Maybe. A strong Flush or Full House could get it done. The debuff on Spades really hurts, though. That complicates things... I'll have to play carefully, maybe focus on non-Spade hands.\n\nHere's the problem: The Holographic Joker, early, is huge. +10 Mult. Very good. It's the safer play. Grabbing the Foil Tag is a gamble, and might not even pan out in my favor if I can't beat the Boss and get to a shop. Plus, playing gives me the shop *immediately*. The shop is good! Vouchers, planets, Tarots! That early shop could make the run.\n\nIf I play it smart, I can make 450 chips without Jokers. It's a no-brainer. After the Big Blind, I hit the shop, get that Holographic Joker, and build an economy. I'm taking the safe route.\n\nSo, the action is `play_round`. Time to crush that Big Blind.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
