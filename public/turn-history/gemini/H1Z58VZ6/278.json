{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Pack Choice for Maximum High Card Score**\n\nOkay, end of the run is approaching, ante 8/8, round 24. Gotta make this pack count. My goal is to maximize the score with High Card builds, focusing on the multipliers I've got going. Let's see... I've got a killer Joker setup: DNA and Brainstorm (copying hands for chips), Ride the Bus (big mult for no face cards!), Steel Joker (X3.4 mult that scales with Steel cards), and Blue Joker (chips based on deck size). Plus, I have The Tower consumable, so I could stone a card. I've also got some good vouchers like Telescope, Planet Merchant, Grabber and Paint Brush.\n\nNow, looking at the cards. Pack Choice 1: Jack of Clubs, instantly a no-go. Face card. Kills Ride the Bus, so that's out. Pack Choice 2: 3 of Hearts, Lucky. Not a face card! Adds to the deck for Blue Joker's chip bonus *and* has the Lucky enhancement - nice. Pack Choice 3: 7 of Spades. Not a face card either, also helps the Blue Joker.\n\nThe 3 of Hearts seems to be the best play. It’s not a face card, so it preserves my Ride the Bus multiplier. Also, Lucky is a strictly better enhancement than just a base card of a higher rank (7 of Spades) since I'm relying on Jokers for the bulk of my score. The \"Lucky\" doesn't count as a face card, phew. And yes, increasing the deck size boosts Blue Joker which is very important.\n\nAlright, so the action is definitely `select`. The position is 2, the 3 of Hearts. Gotta remember to keep track of the game step, so I don't confuse myself later. I'm going for High Card, obviously.\n\nMy estimated chips are hard to guess at this stage. I'm just adding a card to the deck. It's not going to be scored *yet*. But previous High Cards were getting around 90k, IIRC.\n\nHold on, I have The Tower. I *could* stone the 3 of Hearts, but I don't think I can do that *now*. I need to pick the card first, and then I can use it on cards during a round, or maybe in some shop interaction if the game allows.\n\nSo, the action is `select`, position `[2]`. No reason to `skip_booster` because any card helps Blue Joker! 3 of Hearts is better than 7 of Spades, Lucky > base! \n\nAction: `select`. Position: `[2]`. Let's get this!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
