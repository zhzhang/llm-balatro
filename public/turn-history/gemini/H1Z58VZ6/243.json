{"reasoning":"**My Assessment: Ante 7/8, Round 21 - Planet Pack Decision**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 7/8, Round 21. We're in the PLANET_PACK phase, specifically the Celestial Pack. The primary goal is clear: reach the Ante 8 Boss. My build is a Level 12 High Card focus, and it's holding up remarkably well.\n\nMy key Jokers are: DNA (that juicy $50 chips copy, foiled!), Brainstorm (duplicating DNA for exponential scaling), Steel Joker (a solid X2.6 Multiplier and counting), Ride the Bus (the Mult boost, which I need to be careful with given the face cards), and Blue Joker (the chip engine, currently at a respectable +168). I also have The Tower consumable, ready for use. I have $51 and a Telescope voucher in my pocket (which will ensure Pluto for High Card).\n\nNow the decision. The choices are Pluto (High Card +1 Mult, +10 chips), Mars (Four of a Kind upgrade), and Earth (Full House upgrade). This is a no-brainer. This build is completely dedicated to High Card. The Telescope voucher all but guaranteed Pluto's appearance and the intention of my High Card build.\n\nSo, the play is obvious. I need to take Pluto. The logic is: Select the Pack Card in the first position, which is Pluto. No hand cards are targeted.\n\nThe action is a `select`, the position is `[1]`.\n\nDoes Pluto benefit the build? Unequivocally, yes!\n\nIs there any reason to deviate and take Mars or Earth? Absolutely not.\n\nAre there any constraints that prevent me from choosing Pluto? No, it's a clean choice.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\nThat's it. It's a simple optimization step.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
