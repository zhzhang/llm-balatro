{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop again, at Ante 4, Round 9, with $14 in the bank. I've got a decent setup: DNA and Brainstorm working together to duplicate cards, Blue Joker for flat chips, Mail-In Rebate for a multiplier boost, and Ride the Bus for scaling multiplier. My goal remains maximizing score and progressing through the Antes using a High Card strategy, which is what my Jokers support.\n\nLet's break down the shop options. I see `To Do List` (Foil, +50 chips, $4 cost). I'm not really running hands, I'm going for High Card. While it *sounds* good, given what I'm doing, it's not better than anything I have. `Saturn` levels Straights, completely useless here. I could reroll the shop for $5, but that would leave me with $9, which might be a problem for interest later. I've already bought the Standard and Celestial Packs, so no new planet or tarot cards.\n\nSo, the plan is: I'm happy with my Joker setup: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. They're ordered to maximize the effect of DNA, which is the heart of my engine. I'm going to move on to the next blind.\n\nBefore I commit, let's look again at the `To Do List`, because I'm good at forgetting. It's +50 chips if I get a Three of a Kind, but I'm not playing Three of a Kinds, I'm playing High Card. Not going to take it. I have the `Death` consumable, but I can't use that in the shop.\n\nRight, so to recap: My money is $14. I have all the Jokers I need. The next best action is to move forward to the next round. I'm going to `round_select`.\n\nLet me quickly double-check the reroll option. Cost is $5. Money after reroll is $9. Is that better than saving for interest? Not likely. I'm fairly stable, and I'd rather have the money for a more useful shop later.\n\nFinal check: Game Step is SHOP. Action: `round_select`. Wait, let me check past turns again, I remember grabbing the 7 of Hearts earlier. I think I'm all set. Yep, nothing else to buy. The only sensible action is to proceed to `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
