{"reasoning":"**My Current Shop Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5/8, Round 17. I've got $41, and the reroll cost is $7 – perfectly manageable at this stage. I'm running a pretty solid \"High Card\" strategy, and it's built around avoiding face cards with \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nI've got a fantastic Joker setup: DNA and Brainstorm (a clone engine), Blue Joker for big chip boosts, and Steel Joker for multiplicative scaling. \"Ride the Bus\" is there for additional Mult. The shop has The Idol (X2 mult, currently for Queen of Spades) and Mercury (Pair Level).\n\n*   *The Idol:* Definitely not worth it. I'm deliberately *avoiding* face cards, and even if I weren't, it's too RNG-dependent for the cost and the joker slot. I'd need to rebuild my deck to reliably trigger it.\n*   *Mercury:* A level-up to Pair is just not attractive. I’m focusing on maximizing \"High Card,\" and there are far more potent boosts out there, like Pluto, that I should prioritize.\n\nSo, the plan? Reroll! I have more than enough money. It's my best chance to find something game-changing: Pluto, a better Joker like Blueprint or Constellation, or more Steel support. I’ll keep rerolling until I find something worthwhile. My existing Jokers are strong, so I don't need to replace them unless I find something truly superior. The current shop items are not a consideration.\n\nAction: `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
