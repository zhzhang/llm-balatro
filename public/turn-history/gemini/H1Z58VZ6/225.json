{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Optimization and Round Selection**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. I'm in Ante 6, with $40 and a strong High Card build. My goal is to maximize my score while conserving resources. Right now, I'm thinking about the most efficient path forward.\n\nFirst, I assessed my hand. I have a very strong Joker set: Steel Joker, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, DNA, and Blue Joker. My High Card strategy is already generating significant base chips, and I'm well above the Big Blind requirement of 45,000.  The math checks out - my current estimate is around 54,000. Riff-raff and Hallucination, the shop cards, aren't tempting since they require selling a key joker, and my current set is too good to break.\n\nSince I am already far above the required amount, I need to decide what to do with my money. I have already used the single reroll available to me. I had to choose between continuing to reroll or proceeding to the round.\n\nGiven that I have a comfortable score, my initial thought was to simply move to the round select, but then I started to think about long-term scaling. A reroll could potentially find a Planet Pack with Pluto, which would further level my High Card strategy, but at this point in the game, it's not strictly necessary.\n\nNow I am calculating whether to reroll, and how many times. I have $40.\n\nThen, I started to think about something even more optimal: I remembered that I have Brainstorm and DNA. Brainstorm is copying the leftmost Joker. If DNA is leftmost, I will generate a permanent steel card copy with each hand! I want to capitalize on my Steel Joker (X0.2 mult per steel card, currently X2.2) and make it scale faster. This order is what I want:\n\n1.  **DNA** - To trigger the card creation.\n2.  **Brainstorm** - Copying the first Joker (which is now DNA), adding a Steel card.\n3.  **Steel Joker** - to get the multiplier.\n\nSo, the play is: *rearrange_jokers 4 2 1 3 5*.\n\nThis will allow me to generate additional Steel cards for each hand. Now, should I reroll? No, I should select the next round. I'll save the money for later. I am now confident.\n\n**Decision:** I'm going to perform the `rearrange_jokers` action, and move to round select in the next turn. This will optimize my Steel Joker scaling for future rounds.\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [4,2,1,3,5]"}
