{"reasoning":"**Current Decision: Mercury Consumption and Joker Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the shop, Ante 5, Round 17. The goal remains: maximize chip output to beat the rounds and, ultimately, win the game. I have a High Card build going, which is solid, but this shop presents a tactical decision point. I've got $52, and the boss blind is \"The Needle\" – only one hand allowed, so this requires an immediately optimized approach.\n\nMy Jokers are: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm (copying Ride the Bus), Blue Joker, DNA, and Steel Joker. My consumables are Mars (Four of a Kind) and Mercury (Pair), and I'm sitting on a decent chunk of money.\n\nGiven the Needle boss, my primary thought is to leverage DNA to duplicate a High Card, maximizing my chip output. To do this effectively, I've got to use Mercury and then reroll the shop for any key cards before I head into the blind. I do want to rearrange my Jokers for The Needle. DNA needs to be in slot 1 and Brainstorm in slot 2.\n\nNow, Mercury. Leveling up Pair isn't ideal but it's *okay*. It certainly doesn't hurt. And then there's the shop. Red Card, which I don't want. Reroll is $5. I *could* sell Mercury for $1, but there's a slight upside to using it, even if it's secondary. The consumables are already taking up space in my inventory, so might as well use them, even if it's just to clear the space for another useful consumable.\n\nMy strategy is to consume Mercury *now*, then consider a reroll of the shop. I'll need to rearrange Jokers to make sure DNA is in slot 1 and Brainstorm in slot 2. The Mercury schema is simple. Use Mercury, no need to specify the target card; so the JSON will be simple:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\nMercury is at position 2 in my consumable list. I'm going to do this *now*, then move to optimize the Jokers before hitting the round select screen.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
