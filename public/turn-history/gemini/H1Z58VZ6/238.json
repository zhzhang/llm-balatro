{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Round**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 6, Round 20, and I'm in the shop with $39. My Joker setup is pretty solid: DNA copying steel cards, Brainstorm mirroring that, Steel Joker for multiplicative boost (with the scaling), Ride the Bus for additive mult, and Blue Joker providing a healthy chip base. I also have The Tower consumable, which is key for preserving my \"Ride the Bus\" streak by stonking face cards.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Ice Cream offers a chip boost, but it's not worth selling Blue Joker for a decaying +100 when I already have a much better chip source (+164 from Blue Joker). The Wrathful Joker, while offering +3 Mult for Spades, is insignificant compared to Ride the Bus (+29) and the Steel Joker (x2.2 mult based on steel cards, potentially higher if I have a good steel count). I'm at 5/5 Jokers, so buying anything means selling something, and neither of these options is an upgrade.\n\nMy strategy is centered around High Card using DNA/Brainstorm to copy Steel cards (crucially non-face cards) and leveling it up via Pluto (thanks to the Telescope voucher). Ride the Bus scales my mult. The shop isn't offering any Tarot or Planet packs, and I've already rerolled once, so the expected value of another reroll is low. Plus, interest maxes at $25, and I'm getting $5 interest on my current $39, and I want to save money for later shops/vouchers.\n\nBefore moving on, quick joker check: Brainstorm copies DNA, as expected, making it optimal. Also, The Tower is useless right now since I can't target a card in my hand from the shop.\n\nSo, the optimal move is `round_select`. I'm going to head into the next round, maintaining my current setup.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
