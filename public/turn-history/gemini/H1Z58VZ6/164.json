{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment and Card Selection**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. We're in Round 15 with a 5/8 ante, so the stakes are getting higher. My immediate goal, as always, is to get to the chip threshold - likely around 16,000 for this ante level. Currently, I'm riding a High Card strategy that's at Level 6, a pretty solid foundation.\n\nMy current joker setup is pretty solid: \"Ride the Bus\" giving me a nice +23 Multiplier which I'm doubling with \"Brainstorm\", plus the potent \"Blue Joker\" for a healthy chip gain of +152 and \"DNA\" that's contributing a +50 chip bonus. I have a open slot after selling \"Mail-In Rebate\" in the last round and, the key here is, I have the opportunity to make a huge jump.\n\nNow, calculating the raw numbers – without the Joker in question - High Card gives me 55 Chips, with a 6x Multiplier. This is supplemented by the +152 Chips from Blue Joker, and 50 chips from DNA. Multiplying the Chip count (257) with my base multiplier (52) gives me a score of 13,364.\n\nBut, I have a clear path to improvement. The \"Steel Joker\" is available, and it's looking like a significant upgrade, offering a X2 multiplier for each Steel Card in my deck. Currently, that's only X2, but I can improve on that with some clever card choices from Tarots. Adding this to the equation skyrockets the score to 26,728!\n\nSo, the optimal move here is clear. I need to select the \"Steel Joker,\" which is conveniently located in the second position of the booster pack. The command is `select 2`. This is a no-brainer, and should significantly propel me towards the chip threshold.\n\nThe JSON is ready, valid, and compliant. Time to execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
