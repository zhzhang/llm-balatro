{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Round: Play or Skip?**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my current situation. Ante 4, Round 9. I'm at the \"BLIND_SELECT\" stage, facing a Small Blind worth 5000 chips. I have $14 currently, I'm almost at the $15 interest mark.\n\nThe Small Blind's reward is $3, and the skip tag is the \"Uncommon Tag\" that offers a free Uncommon Joker in the shop. The upcoming blinds are Big (7500, $4, \"Top-up Tag\") and the Boss (10000, $5, \"The Club\" which debuffs all Club cards, that won't matter to me).\n\nMy current Jokers are: DNA (Rare) that copies a single card from the first hand, Brainstorm (Rare) which mirrors DNA, Blue Joker (Common) for +124 Chips, Mail-In Rebate (Common, Holo) offering +10 Mult and $5 for discarded 3s (I can manipulate discard, and I have a Death consumable to shift cards), and Ride the Bus (Common) which currently provides +11 Mult for consecutive hands without face cards.\n\nI also have Death (to convert cards), and several Vouchers. My Hand Level is High Card Level 5, which offers 45 Chips and 5 Mult.\n\nMy strategy is centered around High Card with DNA/Brainstorm duplication. I have a chance to duplicate a high-value card and stack bonuses for the remainder of the game.\n\nThe key considerations here are the Small Blind, the \"Uncommon Tag\", and my scaling Jokers. My slots are full, so taking an Uncommon Joker means selling one, which is rarely a good move. My current build is very strong, so the Uncommon Tag isn't worth it.\n\nSo, I will play. I should be able to gain interest on $15 or $20, scale Ride the Bus (+1 Mult per hand), and potentially trigger Mail-In Rebate.\n\nThe Boss Blind \"The Club\" won't affect me.\n\nLet's estimate the Chips: High Card (45 Chips, 5 Mult), Blue Joker (+124 Chips), Mail-In Rebate (+10 Mult), Ride the Bus (+11 Mult). The total Mult: is 26. Chips from a single High Card will be ~176. That's a score of about 4,576. I can play High Card multiple times to win.\n\n**Action:** `play_round`\n**Data:** `{\"action\": \"play_round\"}`\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
