{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Celestial Pack Purchase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 21. Just beat the Ante 6 boss. I've got a solid setup – $54, a decent Joker spread (DNA, Brainstorm, Steel, Ride the Bus, Blue), and a clear strategy: High Card spam, leveraging Steel Joker's scaling with duplicated Steel cards and avoiding face cards to maximize Ride the Bus. My High Card hand is already at Level 12.\n\nThe shop presents some interesting choices. The Moon card isn't super useful for this specific build, and Devious Joker is useless for me as I play High Card. I have the Telescope voucher, so the Celestial Pack is *gold*. It *will* contain Pluto, which directly levels up my main hand and lets me start planning the path to winning. The Jumbo Standard Pack *could* provide value with steel cards, but is less valuable given the other items. The Blank voucher is a long-term play for Antimatter later on.\n\nMy initial thought was to quickly acquire the Celestial Pack. Then, I had a thought – should I get the Blank voucher first? It's a long-term investment. But given the Telescope voucher, getting Pluto *now* is a game-changer. It's a guaranteed high-impact play. Given my current hand strategy, the most beneficial option is to immediately buy the Celestial Pack.\n\nLet's check the shop items again.\n\nI've got $54, the Celestial Pack costs $3.\n\nMy action will be to buy the Celestial Pack. I need to make sure I use the pack immediately.\n\nSo, the optimal action is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\nThis fits the schema, and now I should get that Celestial Pack and start scaling.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
