{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Prioritizing Three of a Kind**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase, aiming to build a strong deck for this Planet Pack. My main focus right now is improving my hand, specifically the \"Three of a Kind,\" which I've played the most so far. I just bought a Celestial Pack, leaving me with $6. My inventory includes a Mail-In Rebate and a Telescope Voucher. The Mail-In Rebate will give me +10 mult and $5 for discarding 3s, which could be useful later. The Telescope Voucher is great because it guarantees my most played hand's planet will be in the pack, so I'm pretty sure I'm getting Venus.\n\nLooking at the Celestial Pack options, it's pretty clear:\n\n1.  Venus: This is the Three of a Kind upgrade (confirms my expectation from the Telescope Voucher). It levels up the hand with +2 Mult and +20 Chips. Yes!\n2.  Jupiter: Flush Upgrade\n3.  Mercury: Pair Upgrade\n\nSince I want to boost Three of a Kind, and given the Telescope Voucher, Venus is the obvious choice. The goal is to upgrade that hand type to scale for later rounds. Choosing Venus will use the Planet Card immediately (standard Celestial Pack behavior), so no further choice is necessary.\n\nI’m entering `select 1` to choose Venus.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
