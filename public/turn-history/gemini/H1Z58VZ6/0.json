{"reasoning":"**Initial Ante Analysis: Blind Select**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the Blind Select screen for Ante 1, Round 0. The current blind is the Small Blind and it's asking for 300 chips. The reward for playing it is $3. There's also a Holographic Tag available to skip. Hmm, the next blind is the Big Blind, which will need 450 chips. It's offering a Foil Tag as the skip reward. And I'm looking at the upcoming boss: The Pillar. Debuffs to Spades, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nI only have $4 right now, and I have zero Jokers in my deck.\n\nLet's think this through: In the early game, especially at Ante 1, skipping a blind for a good tag is often a solid strategy. Specifically, this Holographic Tag is the key. A Holographic Joker gives a whopping +10 Mult, which is a *massive* early game boost. It pretty much guarantees I can clear the chip thresholds for the early blinds easily. And getting a free, potentially very good, Joker with +10 Mult is much more beneficial than the immediate $3 reward. The $3 reward would only give me ~$7 after the small blind, which isn't enough to buy much in the shop. Getting a guaranteed Holographic Joker for free in the shop is just more value in this situation.\n\nSo, if I skip the Small Blind, I get the Holographic Tag. I’ll move to the Big Blind, and if I skip that one, I'll get a Foil Tag. Then after I win the Big Blind, I hit the shop, and can collect my free Holographic Joker.\n\nIf I play the Small Blind, I'm playing the 300 chips. I’ll get $3 and have about $7 for the shop. But this will take longer to build.\n\nNo question. Skipping the Small Blind and getting that Holographic Tag is the way to go. It sets me up for a much stronger early game, and allows me to begin the crucial Joker construction in the early phases.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_round\""}
