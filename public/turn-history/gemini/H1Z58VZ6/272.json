{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis and Execution - Ante 7/8, Round 24**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My objective is 70,000 chips, and the boss, \"The Eye,\" forces me to avoid repeat hand types. This means playing each hand uniquely. I'm sitting on a solid foundation, but the margins are tight.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the hand and devise a strategy for achieving the target score. The initial calculations focused on a high card play: I've got a DNA Joker that triggers on a single card hand, which then allows Brainstorm to make a copy. My intuition says that using DNA and Brainstorm would be incredibly powerful in the long run. The 10H (foil) is my ticket with the initial play.\n\nThe Steel Joker is critical: a 3.4x multiplier is the game-changer, and \"Ride the Bus\" gives +33 Mult. I need to make the most of it. I had to factor in the Blue Joker and its chip boost based on cards remaining in the deck. I got a little worried about the steel card I thought I bought. The key is to maximize both chips and the mult for that high score.\n\nThe initial High Card calculation showed a score just shy of the target (68,054.4), but the analysis flagged a problem. I wasn't accounting for a potential Steel Card multiplier; and I did not have it in hand. The Stone Card +50 chips and potential Steel card in hand looked a little short.\n\nI have two consumables: The Tower (Stone Card) and Justice (Glass Card). This is where the magic happens. I can use Justice to enhance the 10H (foil) into a Glass Card (x2 mult). This is the key. The initial calculations revealed that I would clear the target *easily* with the Justice enhancement.\n\nIf I use the Justice consumable on the 10H, I create a Glass card. The 10H glass will score approximately 136k if played as High Card. I also have DNA (foil) at position 1. Brainstorm will then copy it.\n\nI'm playing a single-card hand, so DNA triggers, and Brainstorm copies it. That's a good setup for the long haul.\n\nLet's double-check the logic. The goal is to maximize the score:\n*   High Card base chips.\n*   Glass Foil 10H for chips and x2 Mult.\n*   The Blue Joker gives bonus chips.\n*   The DNA Foil Joker adds more chips.\n*   Ride the Bus and Steel Joker mults.\n\nThe final calculation is: (145 + 162 + 50 + 10 + 50) * (15 + 33) * 2 * 3.4, resulting in a score well above 70,000 chips. I will go for the Justice 10H play because it maximizes the chip count and, crucially, triggers DNA before the score. I have a backup plan (Steel in hand) if things go wrong, but I don't need it.\n\nAction: `use_consumable` position 2 on card position 2 (10H).\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,2]"}
