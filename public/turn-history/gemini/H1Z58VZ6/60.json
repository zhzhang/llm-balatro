{"reasoning":"**Strategic Evaluation for Planet Pack Selection**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 7, and I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase from the Jumbo Celestial Pack. I've got $12, a decent set of Jokers: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate and Ride the Bus. My vouchers are Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale, which gives me some flexibility.\n\nMy primary strategy is a High Card build. It's the most played hand so far, I have Ride the Bus to boost its multiplier, and Blue Joker will add a bunch of chips. DNA and Brainstorm are the deck-manipulation tools, either thinning it or creating consistent plays. Telescope is key here, I know Pluto (High Card) is guaranteed. \n\nThe choices are Pluto (High Card), Saturn (Straight), Earth (Full House), Venus (Three of a Kind), and Uranus (Two Pair). It's a no-brainer given the strategy. High Card is the cornerstone, Pluto is right there, and the Telescope ensures its presence. Leveling up High Card is the current goal. So, I need to select Pluto, position 1.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
