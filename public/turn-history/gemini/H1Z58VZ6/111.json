{"reasoning":"**The Path Forward: A Calculated Gamble**\n\nOkay, here we are: Ante 4, Round 11. Shop phase. $33 in the bank. High Card is the name of the game, and it's doing well. Level 6, solid base.\n\nMy current setup is solid. I've got a DNA + Brainstorm engine – a rare combo that's key for building the deck. Blue Joker is a powerhouse for scaling with deck size. Ride the Bus is giving me consistent mult, and Mail-In Rebate adds a holo mult bonus and a little bit of economy. I'm feeling confident about this upcoming boss.\n\nThe shop offers *Judgement* for $2 and *Square Joker* for $3, both at a discount due to a \"Clearance Sale.\" *Judgement* creates a *random* joker. Tempting, but risky at this stage. I'm at the Joker limit, so I'd need to sell one. DNA/Brainstorm are foundational. Blue Joker is providing a huge chip boost. Ride the Bus is providing mult. Mail-In Rebate (holo) gives mult. Selling any of them for a random common joker is likely to be a downgrade. Square Joker is useless for my High Card build anyway.\n\nRerolling for $6 is inefficient. $33 - $6 = $27. I still make $5 interest.\n\nMy current scoring potential is pretty good. High Card nets me a base score. With Blue Joker, I'm getting a ton of chips. Ride the Bus and Mail-In Rebate are providing solid mult. I have -1 hand and +1 hand cards, so that gives me 4 starting hands. Based on my calcs, I'm scoring somewhere in the range of 20k to 30k. That *should* be enough for the boss.\n\nThe shop cards are not useful for my current setup. The reroll is too expensive for a gamble. My best move is to press forward. The DNA/Brainstorm combo will just get stronger as the deck grows.\n\nWait a second, what about *Judgement*? I have 0/2 consumables. I *could* buy it, sell a joker, use it, and sell whatever I get. But that's a gamble. It might not be worth it right now.\n\nLooking at the shop, there's nothing that immediately improves my score, safely. I'll just keep the $33 for now.\n\nLet's double-check the Joker positioning. Brainstorm needs to copy DNA for the first hand. That setup is correct. After the first hand, I need to have Brainstorm copy Ride the Bus, Mail-In Rebate, or Blue Joker. Brainstorm copies the ability of the leftmost joker. Let's see...\n\n*   Ride the Bus: +15 mult.\n*   Mail-In Rebate: +10 mult, though maybe. Mail-In Rebate (holo) is an edition, not the ability. Mail-In Rebate's ability is the economy part.\n*   Blue Joker: +134 chips.\n\nBrainstorm's copying the *ability*, not the whole card. Okay, I've got it.\n\nThe most important thing for the shop is to be set up to proc DNA on the first hand. That's what I'm doing. Nothing else to buy. The $33 is better saved. Rerolling is not needed, I think.\n\nOkay, let's go.\n\nOkay, wait. Let me double-check Ride the Bus. It says +15 mult. Brainstorm copying Ride the Bus would be another +15 Mult. So my total mult is 6 + 10 + 15 + 15 = 46. Chips are 189 + 0 = 189. Score: 189 \\* 46 = 8,694. With 4 hands, that is around 34k. I am safe!\n\nOkay, hand 1 has the DNA proc (with the lower score). Score is 189 \\* 31 = 5,859. Hands 2-4: 189 \\* 46 = 8,694. Total potential: 5,859 + (3 \\* 8,694) = 31,941. It's plenty!\n\nDecision: Leave the shop.\n\nWait! I see *Judgement*. It costs $2. I have 0 consumables. Should I buy and hold it? It doesn't hurt me (since I can sell it for $1). I still get interest!\n\nLet's just look at the money. $33. If I buy *Judgement*, I'll\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
