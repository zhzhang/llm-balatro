{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante, Joker Synergy, and Shop to Maximize Value**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 3, Round 4. Got $20 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: Mail-In Rebate (mult and money), Ride the Bus (scaling High Card/Three of a Kind), Red Card (scaling, but dependent on skipping boosters), Blue Joker (chips), and Scholar (Ace synergy). I also have a Magician consumable ready to go. The Telescope voucher is active, so I know I'll get a planet card that will likely enhance a High Card or Three of a Kind.\n\nMy primary focus here is maximizing my hand's potential. DNA in the shop is the key to that since I have Scholar and Aces in the deck, so my thoughts are revolving around the best way to get it. This \"If first hand of round has only 1 card, add a permanent copy to deck and draw it to hand.\" is huge. If I can get multiple aces out in a round, Scholar will scale the mult very, very quickly. It synergizes so well with my Scholar Joker.\n\nThe shop has DNA ($8), Lusty Joker ($5), a Buffoon Pack ($4, not helpful right now since I have 5/5 Jokers), and a Celestial Pack ($4, potentially useful with the Telescope). Hieroglyph (-1 Ante, -1 hand) is also tempting for scaling, but a permanent hand penalty is risky this early.\n\nFirst, I need to decide what to do with my existing Jokers. Red Card is my weakest link right now. At +6 mult, it only scales by skipping booster packs, and I have Telescope. It feels the least valuable compared to Mail-In Rebate and Scholar (Ace synergy) in my current Joker set. Since I'll want a Celestial Pack if I can fit it, skipping a pack is not optimal.\n\nI can't just buy DNA; I'm at 5/5 Jokers. So I need to dump a joker. I can't dump Scholar, because it's integral to the DNA strategy. Mail-In Rebate is good for income, but it's not core to a scaling strategy.\n\nIt looks like the best play is to buy DNA and the Celestial Pack. I'll dump Red Card to make space. Since DNA costs $8 and the Celestial Pack costs $4, that's a total of $12 with the Celestial Pack.\n\nLet's do the math: I have $20, sell Red Card for $2, and buy DNA for $8. That leaves $14. Then, I buy the Celestial Pack for $4. I'll still have $10 left over.\n\nOkay, here's my plan: First, I sell Red Card. Then, I buy DNA and the Celestial Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
