{"reasoning":"**Reroll Decision Time**\n\nOkay, I'm in the shop after buying a Standard Pack, and the ante is climbing. Currently at Ante 4 with a High Card strategy. My goal is the Ante 8 Boss. I have $38, which is above the interest cap, so that's good. The shop has Business Card and Riff-raff. Neither are great for this build. I have DNA and Brainstorm (duplicating my first card played), Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus – a solid setup.\n\nRight now, I'm evaluating my options. Should I reroll? I have enough money to comfortably do so and still maintain max interest. A reroll costs $5. It could uncover a valuable Tarot, Planet card (Pluto!), or maybe even a game-changing Joker. Or I can just move on.\n\nThe shop items are not useful. Saving money for the next shop is the other option, but I have plenty right now. Rerolling once is standard. The next round is the Boss Blind (20k-30k). My current hand can do around 28k (7k per hand x 4 hands), and it is not a guarantee. Finding a better Joker or a Pluto would be beneficial.\n\nMy money after a reroll will still be at max interest ($33). Now, let me check the \"Shop Vouchers\" and \"Shop Boosters\" sections. None. A reroll only changes the cards. Is the gamble worth it for the shop cards? Probably not, the current Joker setup is good. But, a better mult is possible.\n\nGiven the high cash and mediocre shop, I will reroll once. I just finished the Big Blind, so the next blind is the Boss. I need to get as much mult/chips as possible.\n\nOkay, let's just make the decision. I see \"Current Money: $38\" and \"Reroll Cost: $5\". I'll `reroll_shop`.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
