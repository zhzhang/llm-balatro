{"reasoning":"**My Shop Strategy - Ante 4/8, Round 11**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4, Round 11, and I'm in the shop with $41. My current hand level is High Card Level 6, which is good. I need to make the best decision for my current strategy: high card spam, avoiding face cards to scale \"Ride the Bus,\" and leveraging \"DNA\" and \"Brainstorm\" to duplicate key cards.\n\nI have some solid Jokers: DNA, Brainstorm (for copying DNA!), the Blue Joker (+132 Chips!), Mail-In Rebate (Holo and +10 Mult with economy), and Ride the Bus (+15 Mult). The \"Ride the Bus\" joker is key, so I don't want to buy face cards.\n\nThe shop offers a \"Business Card,\" \"Riff-raff,\" and a \"Standard Pack.\" The Business Card is a hard pass. \"Riff-raff\" is tempting, but creating two common jokers isn't worth the cost of selling a better Joker. I have to skip it. The \"Standard Pack\" for $3, however, is intriguing. It could give me a Red Seal, a Steel card, or a non-face card to keep my deck count high for the Blue Joker's chip bonus. This aligns perfectly with my strategy. I need to buy it.\n\nI've already used my Celestial Pack (Pluto) to get High Card to Level 6. I'm focusing on cheap ways to build my deck.\n\nI consider the options. The reroll is $5. While that could potentially get me a better joker, I'm happy with what I have. I could buy the standard pack, and then reroll, but my money is plenty. The \"Standard Pack\" is my primary move. So, let's buy the Standard Pack:\n\n`buy_booster 1`\n\nLet's double-check DNA and Brainstorm. They're set up perfectly: Brainstorm copies DNA. Beautiful.\n\nI need to confirm there is nothing else to buy. Nope. No vouchers.\n\n*Now I think,* is there anything I'm missing? I should recheck my thought process to be optimal. \n\nReroll is $5. I could reroll after the pack. But the pack is the priority.\n\n`buy_booster 1`\n\nI'm starting to think about past turns to make sure I'm where I should be. Did I already buy a booster? Looking back, I bought a Celestial pack on the previous round. Now I'm in the shop. I'm going to buy that \"Standard Pack\", which is Booster 1.\n\nI just need to buy the Standard Pack!\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\nOkay, let's think about this a little deeper, what do I *really* want? To scale the deck!\n\nI've got the Standard Pack: $3 for a chance at Steel, Blue Seal, or a useful deck-filler.\nThen there's the Reroll: $5 for a shot at better Jokers or Tarot.\n\nGiven DNA, adding high-value cards to the deck is a good long-term play! So, buy the pack!\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
