{"reasoning":"**Current Strategic Analysis: Ante 3/8, Round 7**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. We're at Ante 3/8, Round 7, with a small blind already defeated, and sitting on $12. My hand is looking pretty interesting, a little bit janky but with some serious potential. I've got DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker providing a substantial +112 chips, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus (+7 Mult!). I also have the Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale Vouchers. My High Card level is currently 2, granting me a base of 15 Chips and 2 Mult.\n\nI'm focused on maximizing the High Card play and scaling Ride the Bus, but DNA and Brainstorm are the real stars here. Given that I have the Blue Joker already giving such a high chip count, buying other chip-boosting Jokers seems like a waste. I'm thinking I should use this to find some more great cards.\n\nMy immediate options in the shop are Odd Todd, Sly Joker, a Standard Pack, and a Reroll. Odd Todd and Sly Joker are not optimal with my current setup. The reroll is tempting, but a gamble. The Standard Pack is what I'm leaning toward.\n\nI have DNA and Brainstorm. That's a combo with the ability to copy cards. I *need* to find a useful card to copy. A good card here is going to become a staple. The Standard Pack gives me a shot. Given Clearance Sale it's only $3. With $12 and the $3 purchase, I'll be left with $9, which means losing one point of interest next round, but it's worth the trade-off. It's a calculated risk in favor of deck scaling. This seems like the most effective way to improve the deck right now.\n\nMy thought is to buy the Standard Pack and prioritize finding a good card to add to the deck to have DNA copy. I'm going to commit to that.\n\nWait, it's the Big Blind next. Time to get some cards and get winning.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
