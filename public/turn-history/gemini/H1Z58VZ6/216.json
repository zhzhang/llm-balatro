{"reasoning":"**Alright, here's the plan for this round.** I'm sitting at 6/8, Small Blind, Round 19. I need 20,000 chips to win, and I'm starting with zero. I've got a decent hand, and some powerful Jokers: Steel Joker, Brainstorm (which copies Steel Joker), Ride the Bus, DNA (this is key), and Blue Joker. I also have The Emperor consumable in my first slot. My goal is to win the round and optimize my resources. I also have $14 to play with.\n\nI have a hand of: 10D, 3D, JD, 8H, 7H, 5H, AD, AD, 2D. \n\nMy immediate instinct is to use DNA by playing a single card. I could play 7 of Hearts, which is enhanced by my Mult modifiers. I'm going to quickly calculate this: I've got 85 base chips for a High Card of 9, + 7 from the 7H, and +116 from Blue Joker and +50 from DNA. With my current Mults, that goes to ~48,700 chips. Well over the threshold. This wins the round.\n\nBut hold on, I should use the Emperor first. Before I play that hand. \n\nI *could* just play the hand, win, and go to the shop with $14. But The Emperor will give me two random Tarot cards. These might be useful, like Temperance or Hermit, or any other money-making card. Usually, you want to use the consumables within the round to modify the hand. It might give me a better boost. The Emperor creates cards (up to 2 if there's room). It's in slot 1 and the next slot is empty. So, I need to use it.\n\nFirst, I will use The Emperor to get a Tarot. This might give me a better Tarot that I can use during the round. Then, I can play the 7 of Hearts in position 5 and get the DNA multiplier.\n\nMy action will be to use the consumable.\n\nI should also note, there's no need to rearrange any jokers.\n\nHere's my JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
