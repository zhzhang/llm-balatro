{"reasoning":"**Shop Reroll Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown for Round 13 at Ante 5/8. I'm in the SHOP phase with $30, a decent chunk of change. My goal, as always, is to comfortably progress to the next blind. Currently, I'm running a High Card build, level 6.\n\nLet's see what's in the shop: `Showman` and `Wily Joker`. Unfortunately, neither is ideal right now. `Showman` would let me duplicate Jokers, but I'm maxed out on slots. Selling a valuable Joker to make room is not something I want to do. `Wily Joker` is clearly for Three of a Kind builds, and doesn't synergize with my High Card. No boosters available either.\n\nNow, my Jokers are Blue Joker (+146 Chips), Brainstorm (copying Blue Joker), DNA (+50 Chips, foil), Mail-In Rebate ($5 per discarded 7, rank changes, +10 Mult holo), Ride the Bus (+19 Mult). I also have The Empress (Mult cards) and The Moon (Clubs) consumables.\n\nMy money situation is pretty good. I want to keep $25 or more for the maximum interest of $5. The reroll cost is $5. Should I reroll? Yes, I think I will. A single reroll should give me a better shot at a useful Joker, or maybe even a Planet card, specifically Pluto. The reroll drops me down to $25, which is perfect for maximizing interest.\n\nSo, the plan is to reroll the shop.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
