{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Analysis: Ante 5 Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 5, with Petroglyph having helpfully reduced the difficulty a bit. My immediate goal is to maximize High Card scoring while simultaneously managing my economy and building a strong scaling engine for the upcoming antes.\n\nLet's break down the situation. I've got $40, and the interest cap is $25, so I want to avoid dipping below that. My current Jokers are: Ride the Bus (+23 Mult, and doubled by Brainstorm), Brainstorm (copying Ride the Bus), Blue Joker (+152 Chips), Mail-In Rebate (+$5 on discards, +10 Mult Holo), and DNA (+50 Chips Foil). I also have The Empress (+4 Mult, 2 Mult cards) and The Moon (3 cards to Clubs) consumables, and my High Card is at Level 6, offering 55 Chips and 6 Mult.\n\nI need to quickly assess my hand. Ride the Bus with Brainstorm is already giving me +46 Mult. Mail-In Rebate adds another +10 Mult. Blue Joker and DNA give me a hefty +202 Chips. Combined with my High Card, this means an estimated score of around 15,934. The target for this Ante is roughly 16,000 for the Big Blind, so I'm not that far off.\n\nThe shop offers Strength (Tarot, $2), Walkie Talkie (Joker, $3), and Buffoon Pack ($3). Walkie Talkie's benefits don't fit my High Card strategy, so that's not optimal. Strength *could* be useful, but it's not pressing.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack, however, is very interesting, especially because it's so cheap. Clearance Sale makes this even more appealing. There's always a chance for a rare Joker upgrade, so I should open it. The current state is that I can use DNA to copy cards. I should check my current set up with the current cards first. Brainstorm *is* correctly set up to copy Ride the Bus, so that's good.\n\nTherefore, the first step is clear: I will buy the Buffoon Pack. The value for finding a better Rare or Rare+ Joker is too great to ignore, especially given the cheap cost.\n\n**Action: `buy_booster`**\n**Position: 1 (Buffoon Pack)**\n**Reasoning: Joker slots are full, but I can sell one for a better upgrade**\n\nIn short: `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
