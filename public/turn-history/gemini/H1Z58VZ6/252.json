{"reasoning":"**Strategic Pack Selection: Leveling High Card**\n\nOkay, so it's ante 7/8, round 22. Time for the PLANET_PACK step. I just snagged a Celestial Pack, which is perfect timing. Let's see... my inventory is looking solid: DNA, Brainstorm, three Steel Jokers (at 3.2x), Ride the Bus (+32 chips), and a Blue Joker (+174 chips). Plus, I've got key vouchers like Telescope (ensuring that Planet card for my most played hand, which is crucial) and Clearance Sale. My hand levels are dialed in: High Card is at level 13 and it’s the core of my build, and I've played it 31 times already. I've got $43 to work with, which isn't bad for this stage.\n\nNow, the pack choices... I've got Pluto (High Card), Mercury (Pair), and Mars (Four of a Kind). Easy decision here: I *have* to grab Pluto. The Telescope voucher did its job; Pluto is available, and it levels up my High Card strategy, giving me +1 Mult and +10 chips. Mercury and Mars are completely irrelevant to my core strategy right now.\n\nThe command is `select <pack_card_position>`. Pluto is in position 1. So, the action is \"select\", the position is [1]. I'm going to select Pluto from the pack. That's what I want to do.\n\nAction: Selecting Pluto to level my High Card!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
