{"reasoning":"**Current Dilemma: Broke in the Shop**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 2, Round 2, and I'm staring at a SHOP screen with zero dollars. Not ideal, but let's see what we've got. The Jokers are actually pretty solid for this early stage: Mail-In Rebate is a Holo with a hefty +10 Mult and a discard bonus, and Ride the Bus is going to scale nicely if I can avoid face cards. My current goal is just to win Ante 2.\n\nThe shop offers a Square Joker, which would be tempting, or a Mega Standard Pack, but I'm completely tapped. Rerolls are out of the question at $5, and selling isn't wise given these Jokers. I'm essentially stuck. The hand levels are fine – Three of a Kind is Level 2 which is a good starting point.\n\nGiven the constraints, `round_select` is the only logical choice. I have to proceed to the next blind. No other actions are possible here. I'm choosing `round_select` and moving on. The JSON is clean and valid. Let's see what the next round brings.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
