{"reasoning":"**Balatro: Ante 6, Round 20 - Shop Phase Decision**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 6, Round 20, and I've got $51 to play with. My High Card build is humming along, and the DNA/Brainstorm combo is really paying off, especially with Steel Joker amplifying the Steel cards I have. I'm leveraging the Telescope voucher to ensure I pull Pluto from Celestial packs, which is key to leveling up that High Card. I just used Mars to level up Four of a Kind which helps get through hands, I have one consumable slot open and The Tower in my inventory.\n\nMy current Jokers are looking solid: DNA (foil), Brainstorm (copying DNA), Steel Joker (x2.2), Ride the Bus (+29), and Blue Joker (+164). My High Card is at level 10, so I need to get Pluto to level that further.\n\nThe shop has some interesting options: Burglar, Business Card, a Jumbo Celestial Pack, and a regular Celestial Pack. I'm going to focus on those packs because I need to get my hands on Pluto.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1.  I'm going to buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack. It's listed in the first shop position and costs $4 (taking into account the Clearance Sale).\n2.  I'll use that pack *immediately* to get Pluto and level up High Card.\n3.  Next, I'll buy the regular Celestial Pack, which is in the second shop position, for $3.\n4.  I'll also use this one to hunt for Pluto.\n\nAlright, to make this happen, I need to use the `buy_booster <booster_pack_position>` command. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is in position 1, so the command for the first buy will be... well, let's execute that first command and see how we progress.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
