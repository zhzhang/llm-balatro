{"reasoning":"**The Calculus of Card Selection: A High Card Odyssey**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 5/8, Round 12. Standard Pack selection. Okay, I've got $37. Jokers are DNA, Brainstorm (x2), Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. Hand level's High Card at level 6.\n\nMy goal: choose the second card from this Mega Standard Pack.\n\nHere are the cards:\n\n1.  7 of Hearts (Purple Seal): +7 chips, Creates a Tarot on discard.\n2.  8 of Hearts (Gold): +8 chips, Earn $3 when played and scores.\n3.  King of Hearts: +10 chips.\n4.  2 of Spades (Steel): +2 chips, x1.5 Mult in hand.\n\nMy strategy is High Card, leveraging DNA and Brainstorm for card duplication. Ride the Bus is in play, so non-face cards are crucial. Blue Joker's dependent on deck size, and Mail-In Rebate wants those Aces.\n\nLet's evaluate: The 7 of Hearts (Purple Seal) is the standout. It's an absolute game-changer with DNA/Brainstorm, giving me that consistent Tarot generation. No real downside there. The 8 of Hearts (Gold) is tempting for the money, but it needs to be played to score. The King of Hearts is a face card, immediately negating my Ride the Bus benefit. The 2 of Spades (Steel) is nice, but a single x1.5 multiplier is not as great as consistent Tarot generation at this stage.\n\nTarots are vital for this High Card build. I need them to find Pluto, which is made easier by this Tarot generation.\n\nGiven the 9 of Spades I've taken before, having this 7 of Hearts means I'll have a much easier time getting a purple seal in my opening hands or via discards to duplicate. The Steel card isn't bad, but Tarot utility is more important, especially since I can copy the Purple Seal.\n\nSo, it's a clear choice. I'm selecting the 7 of Hearts. The Purple Seal's synergy with DNA/Brainstorm is too good to pass up for consistent Tarot generation, which is superior for this High Card build.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
