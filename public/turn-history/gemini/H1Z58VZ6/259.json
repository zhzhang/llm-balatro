{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment: Reroll Shop**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7, Shop phase. I've got $35, the goal is to hit the Big Blind at $52,500. Currently running a High Card strategy (Level 14, 135 chips, 14 mult), and I have a solid setup: DNA (foil), Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker. Plus a Tower consumable. I have a Telescope voucher, which is key. The shop offers Splash and Supernova, but neither are immediate upgrades.\n\nMy initial thought was to quickly calculate and make a decision to buy or not buy, but let's go over the shop one more time before making the play. I'm focusing on finding Celestial Packs to level up my High Card using the Telescope. Rerolling costs $6, which leaves me at $29, still above the interest cap of $25.\n\nSupernova is tempting, +31 mult for each High Card play, but it's not better than what I have. And I have to sell a joker. Blue Joker (+174 chips) and Ride the Bus (+32 mult) give a better boost at the moment. I did a quick estimate earlier, and I calculated about 52k in one hand. I might need 2 hands.\n\nI'm trying to weigh the options. Do I want to try to level up High Card, or should I go? I think I can safely reroll.\n\nI've already re-rolled, so this is the second shop. I should reroll again, even though I've seen the shop. I need scaling, and that likely means packs.\n\nI re-evaluated: Is Supernova worth swapping for Ride the Bus? They are essentially the same.\n\nAm I missing an opportunity? Should I sell a joker for a better one later? I don't think so, these jokers are synergetic with each other in a DNA/Steel deck.\n\nInterest cap is $25, and I have $35, so I can reroll once and still keep max interest. I should do that.\n\nMy last calculated score was very close to the big blind. Rerolling is the play.\n\nI need to create the JSON. It's a `reroll_shop`. No positions needed. I'm not going for a hand, and I don't have to estimate anything.\n\nRe-checking: $35 money, $6 reroll, $29 left. Rerolling is valid and optimal. No need to look at Supernova. I need levels.\n\nLet's look at the schema. Reroll shop. No hand. No positions. Nothing. Reroll the shop. This is the best play.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
