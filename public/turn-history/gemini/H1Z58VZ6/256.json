{"reasoning":"**My Shop Phase Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 22, and I'm in the SHOP phase with $40. My current goal is to hit 52,500 chips for the Big Blind, focusing on my High Card level 14 strategy. My Jokers are pretty solid: DNA (copying the first card if it is only one), Brainstorm copying that DNA, Steel Joker giving some multiplier, Ride the Bus helping by not scoring face cards, and Blue Joker giving chips per deck card. I've got a couple of consumables: The Tower (which, by the way, I *cannot* use right now - learned that lesson!) and The High Priestess, which creates random Planet cards. I also have a bunch of Vouchers: Hieroglyph, Blank, Director's Cut, Grabber, Paint Brush, Petroglyph, Telescope, Clearance Sale.\n\nI just received an error message trying to use The Tower, but I know *exactly* why: I tried to use it on a card in what I thought was my \"hand\" (from a booster pack), but the shop phase doesn't work that way. I was targeting position 9, which doesn't exist. Now that that's clear, I can't use The Tower on cards in my deck in the shop.\n\nThe High Priestess, however, is a different story. I can use that, and it doesn't require a target. I have 2/2 consumables slots, so using it will replace the item. I should probably use it now, and see what Planets I get! I have the Telescope voucher, so I'm hoping I get Pluto. But wait! Telescope is for Celestial Packs! High Priestess creates random planets!\n\nSo, the plan:\n\n1.  Use `The High Priestess` in position 2.\n2.  Assess the resulting planets.\n3.  Move to the next round, or reroll if needed.\n\nThe command is straightforward: `use_consumable 2`. It's the only logical next step given my current hand and the fact that I can't use or sell either of the shop cards for my High Card build.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
