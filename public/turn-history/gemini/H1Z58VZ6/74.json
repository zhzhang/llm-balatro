{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decision: Celestial Pack for High Card Supremacy**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. We're at Ante 3/8, Round 8, in the shop phase. I've got $22 in the bank. My Joker lineup is solid: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. I've got a Death consumable (max 2), and Vouchers for Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. Hand levels are High Card (Level 3) and Three of a Kind (Level 3).\n\nThe shop offers The High Priestess ($2) and a Celestial Pack ($3). The High Priestess, while it could be useful with its random planet generation, isn't guaranteed to give me what I need. Importantly, buying The High Priestess would fill my consumable slots.\n\nThe Telescope voucher is active, and because I've been focusing on High Card, the Celestial Pack *guarantees* a Pluto card, which is exactly what I need to level up High Card. This is the most efficient way to scale the deck right now. I can skip the remaining shop options for now, but I could re-roll the shop if necessary.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to buy the Celestial Pack. It's the most reliable path to achieving my goal of High Card level-up. After this purchase, I'll still have $19 to work with.\n\n**Action:** Buy Booster.\n**Position:** [1].\n**Intended Hand Type:** High Card.\n**Estimated Chips:** Null.\nThe request is valid.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
