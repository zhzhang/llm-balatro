{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Play: A Calculated High Card**\n\nOkay, so the goal is 20,000 chips for this small blind, and I'm starting from zero. Let's see... I've got a killer setup here. I have the Steel Joker, which gives a x2.2 multiplier based on steel cards, and Brainstorm which copies the Steel Joker, so that's another x2.2 multiplier. Ride the Bus is at +26 mult, and it increases by one each hand I play without scoring face cards - thankfully, my hand doesn't have any. Then there's DNA - my secret weapon since the first hand of the round only has one card, I'll clone that card to the deck and get a 50 chip bonus. Finally, I have the Blue Joker which gives +116 chips based on cards in the deck.\n\nLooking at my hand: the Stone Card, 10 of Diamonds (a mult card with +4 mult), 3 of Diamonds, 8 of Hearts ($3 gold card), 7 of Hearts (+4 Mult), 5 of Hearts ($3 gold card), two Aces of Diamonds ($3 gold card each), and a 2 of Diamonds ($3 gold card).\n\nNow, the plan is to win it all in one hand to maximize efficiency and that means playing a single card. I can do it! I need to select the right card - the 10 of Diamonds, because it's a mult card, giving a little more than playing the 7 of Hearts.\n\nMy intended hand type is High Card.\n\nLet's do the math: a High Card at level 9 gives 85 chips and 9 mult. Add the 10 of Diamonds at +10 chips, the Blue Joker for +116 chips, and DNA's +50 chips for a total of 261 chips. The base mult is 9 from the High Card, +4 from the 10 of Diamonds, and +26 from Ride the Bus, making 39.\n\nNow for the multipliers. I've got Steel Joker and Brainstorm, which give us a X2.2 * X2.2 = X4.84 multiplier.\n\nTherefore, the final score will be 261 * (39 * 4.84), or 261 * 188.76, which is approximately 49,266 chips! Well over what I need.\n\nPlaying a single card triggers DNA, which will clone the 10 of Diamonds back into the deck. And since I'm not using a face card, Ride the Bus will be at +27 next hand.\n\nSo, the action is `play`, the position is `[2]` (the 10 of Diamonds). The intended hand type is `high card`, and the estimated chips is `49266`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2]"}
