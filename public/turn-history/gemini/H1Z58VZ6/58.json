{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis: Round 7, Small Blind**\n\nOkay, so the ante is 3/8, and my primary goal is to reach 2000 chips. Currently, I'm sitting at 1717, needing just 283 more. I have two hands remaining, and three discards. I also have $10 I just earned from the previous round (discarding 4s).\n\nI have a set of Jokers: Blue Joker (+90 chips), DNA (no longer useful this round), Brainstorm (no longer useful this round), Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus (currently +6 Mult).\n\nMy immediate thought is, let's look for a non-face card play to trigger Ride the Bus. My hand looks okay. I have a 5 of Spades, a Jack of Spades (which is bad for Ride the Bus), and an Ace of Spades (which *is* fine, despite what I initially thought). I also have a Queen of Clubs (bad) and a 10 of Clubs (good) etc..\n\nDNA/Brainstorm aren't useful as it's not the first hand of the round, and Mail-In Rebate is already factored in, and will pay a little.\n\nBase Chips would be 5 (for a High Card), plus 5 for the 5 of Spades and 90 from the Blue Joker.\n1 x 10 (Mail-In Rebate) + 6 (Ride the Bus) = 17 Mult.\n\n100 Chips x 17 Mult = 1700. Since this is over the requirement, it's good.\n\nDo I want to discard to fish for more 4s? I have 3 cards. It's probably better just to take the win, though.\n\nLet's just get it over with, this hand, and move on.\n\nSo the plan is: `play` the 5 of Spades (position 3).\n\nI estimated a chip amount of 1700, and everything seems accurate based on the current state. The key is that Ride the Bus increments *after* the hand, so it remains +6 for this calculation.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3]"}
