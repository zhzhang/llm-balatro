{"reasoning":"**My Strategy for This Turn**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm at Ante 8, and the Crimson Heart boss is looming. I'm building a High Card strategy based on the Steel Joker, so I need to maximize my scoring potential while trying to survive this boss. I have a Jumbo Arcana Pack, and I need to select a Tarot card from it. My initial thought was to find Steel cards, but there aren't any here. I'm trying to decide between the five cards: Strength, The Magician, Justice, The Hanged Man, and The Wheel of Fortune.\n\n*   **Strength** seems weak. It just increases the rank of two cards, and that's not helping my scaling.\n*   **The Magician** isn't great either.\n*   **Justice** enhances a card to Glass. While a Glass card would multiply my score, I'm focusing on Steel cards for my Steel Joker, which relies on *having* those Steel cards. Glass cards break.\n*   **The Hanged Man** could remove a couple of cards from my deck. I have a Blue Joker, so thinning isn't great, but it might help me draw the Steel cards I need. It also could remove two \"4\" cards from my hand.\n*   **The Wheel of Fortune** is the riskiest. It adds an edition to a random Joker. This is a gamble, but if I hit, say, Polychrome on my Steel Joker, I'm probably winning this game no matter what the boss does. If it hits the Brainstorm, that's a huge bonus. Even if it hits the Ride the Bus it's okay. It's a 1 in 4 chance, but a potential game-winner.\n\nMy current money is $16, and I want to reroll the boss if it's bad. Rerolling costs $10.\n\n*   I could reroll the boss if I fail to get a useful edition from Wheel of Fortune.\n*   Thinning the deck with Hanged Man isn't ideal because it decreases Blue Joker bonus but *could* help me draw my key cards quicker.\n*   I considered using the \"Strength\" card, but it doesn't offer much benefit.\n*   Justice seems pretty weak at this stage.\n\nConsidering all the options, I think the *highest* potential play is The Wheel of Fortune. It's an all-or-nothing move, but if it pays off, I'm likely to secure the win. Even if I don't get the best edition, I still have money to reroll the boss. My current Steel Joker is a X3.8 and it needs as many steel cards as possible. So I'll go with Wheel of Fortune.\n\nSo the action is: `select` and the Tarot Pack position is `5`.\n\n`{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [5]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
