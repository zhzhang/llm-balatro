{"reasoning":"**The Optimal Play: A High Card Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 13, Small Blind, needing 11,000 chips. I've got a hand with some interesting Jokers: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. My hand itself isn't terrible: a 6C, 2C, a couple of 10Ds, including one with that Wild/Purple Seal effect, and a 4D Bonus card, plus a Stone Card.\n\nThe key here is those Purple Seals on the 10 of Diamonds. They create a Tarot card when discarded. That’s valuable, but that's *not* what I'm focusing on right now. The real strategy lies in leveraging those Jokers to duplicate the 10 of Diamonds.\n\nThe strategy is: play a single 10 of Diamonds (card position 4) from the current hand. My current strategy is High Card. This triggers DNA, which adds a copy of the card to my deck and hand because it's the first hand of the round, since I'm only playing one card. Brainstorm copies DNA, adding *another* copy. This gives me a big boost.\n\nLet's do the chip calculations. I'm estimating a base of 55 chips at level 6 High Card. The 10 of Diamonds itself gives me 10 chips. The Blue Joker adds 128 chips. Mail-In Rebate gives me +10 mult, and Ride the Bus gives me +17 mult, totaling +27 mult. I also need to check that Ride the Bus's +1 Mult effect will be triggered because I'm not playing a face card.\n\nSo, the chips should be (55 + 10 + 128) * (6 + 10 + 17) = 193 * 33 = 6369. Yes, I double-checked the calculations. That's a solid score from the start, especially since the DNA and Brainstorm Jokers are adding two copies of the card. I've got a good deck building play here.\n\nI've got four hands remaining. Playing one card now gets me a good chunk of the way to the 11,000 target and significantly improves my deck.\n\nSo, the play is simple: Play the 10 of Diamonds (position 4). Intended hand type is \"high card\", Estimated chips: 6369.\n\nOne final check: Mail-in Rebate's +10 Mult is static, since it's the \"holo\" edition. Everything checks out.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4]"}
