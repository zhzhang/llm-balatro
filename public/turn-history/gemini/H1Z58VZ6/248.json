{"reasoning":"**My Game Plan: A Calculated Advance**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Shop phase, $35 in the bank. My immediate goal is to maximize scoring this round and, more importantly, prepare for Ante 8. The primary strategy is High Card, currently at level 13, but I'm really leaning on my DNA/Brainstorm engine to pump out those sweet Steel cards. My core setup includes the DNA Joker on the leftmost slot and Brainstorm copying the DNA. I'm leveraging the Steel Joker for scaling, along with Ride the Bus and Blue Joker for chip boosts. I have a Telescope voucher, which is a big deal since it guarantees a Pluto in Celestial packs, and The Tower, which buffs Stone cards (not relevant to the Steel strategy).\n\nThe current shop is offering Drunkard and Jupiter, neither of which fit my build. A reroll would cost $6, dropping me to $29, but I'd still be above the $25 interest cap. The ideal scenario here would be a Celestial Pack (Pluto) or even a Standard Pack (more Steel cards) or powerful Jokers, but nothing is jumping out as a must-buy. With the Telescope, Celestial Packs are incredibly valuable.\n\nShould I reroll? I did a $5 reroll already. It *might* be worth the risk, but I'm starting to think I should conserve some cash. The reroll cost is going up. I need to balance the need to improve my scaling vs. not having enough money for the next shop. If I move to the next round, I can bank interest to make the next shop.\n\nI'm at the max of 5 Jokers, so I can't buy any additional Jokers, and I'm not seeing anything that warrants selling anything. My Joker arrangement (DNA leftmost, Brainstorm second) is perfect for the start of the next round. Rerolling is tempting to try and get a celestial pack with the Telescope, but if a Jumbo Celestial Pack pops up for $8, I might not have enough cash. I *could* reroll now for $6, which leaves me with $29, which is a safe bet for interest and a single pack. I need scaling for Ante 8.\n\nI've got the Telescope voucher which *really* makes a Celestial Pack a priority. But, with my engine already setup, there's no harm in moving forward.\n\nLet's look at the numbers. $35. A reroll costs $6, taking me to $29. The next reroll would be $7. I've already done a $5 reroll. With this build, I'm already generating a good amount of points, so the standard play here is to make money and scale as quickly as possible.\n\nOkay, I've got a solid setup with DNA and Brainstorm. That's doubling my Steel cards. That's a huge boost to the Steel Joker. This is a very strong engine.\n\nThe wiser play is to move to the next round, get that interest, and keep the reroll cost down for the next round. No need to sell The Tower either, I still have an available slot. I'm going with `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
