{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Shop phase after using Temperance, with $40 to work with. Let's see what we've got. The Jokers I have are a decent base: DNA (Foil), Brainstorm (Holo), Ride the Bus (+36), Steel Joker (X4.2), and Blue Joker (+194). A Tower consumable is in my inventory. The shop offers Splash (Joker, $2), The Devil (Tarot, $2), a Standard Pack ($3), and a Mega Standard Pack ($6).\n\nMy strategy is centered around High Card and Steel Cards. The Steel Joker scales with the number of Steel Cards in the deck, so getting more of those is key. DNA and Brainstorm are great for doubling a card on the first hand and can lead to a huge swing. Blue Joker gives chips based on remaining deck size, so reducing the deck size over time will maximize its output. High Card is currently at level 16, giving me 155 chips and 16 multiplier. The current target is the Ante 8 Boss Blind, Crimson Heart, which is a tricky one because it disables a random joker.\n\nMy immediate plan is to buy the Mega Standard Pack for $6. The goal here is to get more Steel Cards or cards that can become Steel Cards down the line – maybe Kings or Queens, which I can consider converting. Even more 10s or 5s will be good for the Ride the Bus play. This will leave me with $34.\n\nBefore I commit to that, I should briefly consider \"The Devil\" in the shop. It transforms a card into a Gold Card, which is okay for money, but I prefer Steel for scoring. The Tower can make a card a Stone card, adding chips and being non-face, which is helpful for Ride the Bus. And \"Splash\" is useless for my strategy, as it adds a bonus to all cards played and I'm only playing one. \n\nAh, but I'm trying to improve the quality of my deck as quickly as possible, and the Mega Standard Pack is the best move to improve deck quality, so that's the key. Plus, if the Mega Standard Pack also gives me a consumable, it means I can still purchase and use \"The Devil\" later. So, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's execute the buy_booster. The Mega Standard Pack is at position 2 in the booster section.\n\n**Action: buy_booster 2**\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
