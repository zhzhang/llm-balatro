{"reasoning":"**Current Strategy and Next Steps**\n\nOkay, let's take stock. Ante 5, Round 13. My goal is clear: score enough to beat Ante 5 with a High Card build, currently at Level 6. I've got $25, which is the interest cap, so no point staying in the shop longer than necessary.\n\nLooking at the shop, nothing's jumping out at me. `Delayed Gratification` requires no discards, and that's not optimal for the `Mail-In Rebate` joker I have, which profits from discards. I can make more than $2/round using discards, so this isn't worth it. `Uranus`, the two-pair level up card, is useless for my high card strategy, obviously.\n\nMy current joker setup is pretty solid: `Blue Joker` and `Brainstorm` combo, with `DNA`, `Mail-In Rebate`, and `Ride the Bus`. Let me run the numbers: the `Blue Joker` and `Brainstorm` combo give me a significant base chip bonus, +146 * 2. `DNA` adds 50 chips, and `Mail-In Rebate` gives +10 mult, and `Ride the Bus` gives +19 mult. I should remember that the order of the jokers doesn't matter since I don't currently have any multiplicative jokers (xMult).\n\nWith this setup, I estimate a High Card score of around 13,895 chips (397 chips * 35 mult), which, considering my last round score of 14,098, is more than adequate for Ante 5.\n\nBefore leaving, I should probably take a look at my consumables. I have `The Empress` which makes mult cards, I can use those during the round to improve score. `The Moon` converts to clubs. No immediate need. I'll save them for the round.\n\nAlright, nothing left to do here. The shop's a bust. I'm at the interest cap, my jokers are where they need to be. No further actions needed. I'm going to enter the next round. `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
