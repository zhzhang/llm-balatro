{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis and Action Plan**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 6, Round 19. I'm sitting on a decent hand, and need to surpass 20,000 chips. Got some decent Jokers: *Ride the Bus* (crucial for non-face hands), *Steel Joker* (potentially huge multiplier), *Brainstorm* (copying leftmost Joker!), *DNA* (copying first-played card), and *Blue Joker* (nice chip boost). Plus, a couple of consumables: *The Star* (diamonds) and *The Devil* (make a card gold!).\n\nRight now, I've got a hand with several gold cards, an enhanced 7 of Hearts (+4 mult), and a 10 of Diamonds that's a wild card. But, crucially, discarding the 10 of Diamonds gives me a Tarot card, and I can't leave that on the table! I only have one discard left! I just realized that I never re-arranged the Jokers on the last two turns, like I thought I would.\n\nSo, here's the game plan:\n\n1.  **Optimize Joker Order (optional, but probably a good move):** Steel Joker at the far left for Brainstorm to copy it, boosting my multiplier. Current order is Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, Brainstorm, DNA, Blue Joker. Command: `rearrange_jokers 2 3 1 4 5`. If I re-arrange, Brainstorm will copy the Steel Joker x2.2 and result in more total chips.\n2.  **Use Consumable:** Use \"The Devil\" on a card to make it gold and free up a discard slot for the 10 of Diamonds. I want to clear a slot for the upcoming Tarot.\n3.  **Discard 10 of Diamonds:** Discard that 10 of Diamonds, which creates a Tarot card. I only have one discard left!\n4.  **Play the 7 of Hearts:** Play my 7 of Hearts as the first card of the round, since it will be copied by DNA.\n\nIf I rearrange the jokers, I'll end up with ~50k chips, which is way more than the 20k target. Even without the rearrangement, I'm at ~37k chips, easily winning the round. However, the rearrangement is a permanent fix for all rounds (or for as long as I don't change the jokers).\n\nI have a limited set of actions. I can't start with the play action (4). The key to maximizing is to use my actions in the right order.\n\n*   `Rearrange_jokers`: 2.2 * 2.2 = 4.84\n*   `Use_consumable` is a free action.\n*   `Discard` 1 card.\n*   `Play` 1 hand.\n\nThe problem is that I need to free up the consumable slot if I want the Tarot.\n\nI am not going to re-arrange Jokers, since the round will end, and I want to get the Tarot card first.\n\nLet's check the cards in my hand:\n1.  5S\n2.  8H\n3.  8H\n4.  7H (+4)\n5.  5H (Gold)\n6.  AD (Gold)\n7.  AD (Gold)\n8.  10D (Wild, Tarot on Discard)\n9.  2D (Gold)\n\nSo, I will do these commands:\n1. `use_consumable 2 2`\n2. `discard 8`\n3. `play 4`\n\nOkay, so I will start by executing the `use_consumable` command.\n\nThe chosen action is to **`use_consumable`**, with the arguments: consumable position **2** (The Devil) and target card position **2** (the 8 of Hearts). This should free up the consumable slot for the next command!\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2, 2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,2]"}
