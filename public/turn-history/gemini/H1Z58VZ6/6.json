My current hand looks like this: Jack of Spades, 2 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, and 4 of Diamonds. I'm sitting on $4 right now, and I have that Holographic Tag active, which is a nice bonus for later.\\n\\nMy primary goal, of course, is to get those 450 chips. My analysis tells me that I currently have four Hearts (Ace, King, 6, 4) in my hand, and I have a decent chance of completing a flush. There are only four cards left in my deck, so I am going to make the most of those draws.\\n\\nI'm holding two pairs (6s and 4s) in my hand, but that isn't worth holding onto for this round. Considering the goal, I need to go for a flush. Based on the cards, I'm going to discard the Jack of Spades, 2 of Spades, 6 of Clubs, and 4 of Diamonds. That leaves me with positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 containing my heart cards, which is the right move. I need that fifth heart.\\n\\nLet's double-check the logic. Yes, the correct cards to discard are indeed positions 1, 2, 7, and 8. The pair of 6s is a trap in this situation and going for the flush is a higher payoff.\\n\\nThe odds of hitting a heart on the next draw are quite favorable, around 67%. So, I'm confident. I will discard those non-heart cards in positions 1, 2, 7, and 8. Let's see what the next draw holds!\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 2 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 5]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Holographic Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Big.\\nChips Needed: 450\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Ace of Hearts.

I'm starting from scratch, with zero chips and a 450-chip target. I have four hands left, and two discards available. This hand\\u2026 let's see. Ace, King, 6, and 4 of Hearts \\u2013 a promising start. I also see a pair of 6s, and a possible straight with the 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\\n\\nMy gut says go for the flush. I can calculate the probability. With 9 hearts left in the deck out of 36 cards, I calculate about 78% chance I'll hit a heart in a single discard. The potential payoff for the flush is around 280 chips, maybe even more with the Ace and King in play, so potentially over 300. The straight is solid, but will only get me around 220 chips, and then I'm still left needing another 230 to win.\\n\\nPlaying the straight leaves me with the high cards, but fishing for the flush with a high probability and two chances seems optimal. Even one flush is a significant boost. Two flushes and I'm golden, or at least a flush and a smaller hand. I have to discard the 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 6 of Diamonds and the 3 of Diamonds.\\n\\nWait, should I play the straight? No, the flush is still the better long-term play. Now I'm re-analyzing, and I can confirm that the straight is ~220 chips. I am happy to stick with the original plan.\\n\\nOne more card check to be certain that I am discarding correctly. Yes, those four cards are the discards: 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 6 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds. This is standard strategy for this situation.\\n\\nAnd let me just be extra sure about the estimated chips, it is discarding.\\n\\nOkay, everything looks right, mathematically and intuitively. The action is 'discard' with the positions [5, 6, 7, 8]. I am not changing my mind. I am ready for the flush.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 5 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 6]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags:\\n1: Holographic Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Big.\\nChips Needed: 450\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 9 of Spades.

Ante is 1/8, we're in Round 1 (Big Blind), and the target is 450 chips. I'm currently at 0 chips, with $4 in my pocket. Four hands remain, and I have one discard. Crucially, I have a Holographic Tag that will make my next shop Joker free and holographic - potentially very valuable.\\n\\nMy hand consists of the 9 of Spades, 5 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, and 2 of Diamonds. Immediately, I see it: I've got a Flush! Specifically, five Hearts.\\n\\nThe Flush calculation is pretty straightforward. Base chips for a Flush (level 1) is 35, multiplied by 4 (base multiplier). The cards I'm playing add: Ace (11), King (10), 10 (10), 6 (6), and 4 (4), totaling 41 chips. Adding that to the Base is 76 chips. That 76 multiplied by the multiplier of 4 yields 304 chips.\\n\\nThe immediate goal is 450, so I need another 146 chips. With 3 hands remaining and one discard, achieving that is very likely.\\n\\nHere's the tactical breakdown:\\n\\n*   **Option 1 (Immediate Play):** Play the Flush (Ace, King, 10, 6, 4 of Hearts). That gets me roughly 304 chips.\\n*   **Option 2 (Discard Gamble):** Discard non-Hearts (9 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 2 of Diamonds). With 32 cards left in the deck, I have 8 Hearts remaining to draw from the deck, meaning that the odds of getting a good hand are good. It's risky because I only have one discard, but potentially rewarding.\\n\\nRearranging the cards within the flush itself isn't a factor.\\n\\nThe *most* direct and efficient play here is to immediately capitalize on the Flush. It gets me well over 2/3 of the way to the goal and leaves me with more flexibility in the next three hands (considering I have the Holographic Tag). I can probably get the remaining 146 chips even with Pairs or High Cards. With 3 hands left and only needing 146, it is likely I will be able to make it.\\n\\nI'll `play` the Flush (Ace, King, 10, 6, 4 of Hearts) for an `intended_hand_type` of `flush`, estimating 304 chips. The calculation is solid: 76 * 4 = 304.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nplay <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Play the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may play up to 5 cards at a time. If you play a hand, you must also respond with the intended hand type you think you are playing, and an estimate of the number of chips you think you will earn from the hand. Use the results of previous hands played to inform your estimate.\\ndiscard <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Discard the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck.

  "reasoning": "**Analyzing the Optimal Play: A Straightforward Calculation**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante is 1/8, Round 1 (Big Blind). The goal is 450 chips, I'm currently at 304, and I have three hands left. So, I need 146 more chips. I have $4, and my inventory is clean - no Jokers, no consumables.\n\nNow to the hand: I'm holding 10 Spades, 9 Spades, 5 Spades, 3 Spades, 9 Clubs, 2 Clubs, 9 Diamonds, and 2 Diamonds.\n\nFirst, I see the Three of a Kind with the 9s. Let's calculate: base 30 chips, 3 multiplier. The scoring cards (the three 9s) add 27 chips. So, that's (30 + 27) * 3 = 171 chips.\n\nA Two Pair (9s and 2s) would be 84 chips, which is not enough.\n\nA Flush of Spades is possible, but I only have four Spades, meaning I'd have to discard to make it work.\n\nThe Three of a Kind is the obvious, most efficient play here. So, 9 Spades (pos 2), 9 Clubs (pos 5), and 9 Diamonds (pos 7) are the cards I'll use. Playing the extra cards won't affect the win, so I only need to make the Three of a Kind, and it is a win.\n\nWith a Three of a Kind, the score is (30 + 27) * 3 = 171. Plus the 304 chips I already have, that puts me at 475 chips. That's more than the 450 I need, so I win the round.\n\nNow, should I save a hand? Winning now saves 2 hands, which is $2 extra at the end of the round. My goal is reached. I'll just secure the win.\n\nSo, the action is `play`. Positions are 2, 5, and 7. The hand type is `three of a kind`. Estimated chips: 171. And that's that.\n\nLet's double-check the math: 30 + (9+9+9) = 57, and 57 * 3 = 171. 304 + 171 = 475. Yep, that's correct, 475 > 450.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, I'm playing:\n*   Pos 2: 9 of Spades\n*   Pos 5: 9 of Clubs\n*   Pos 7: 9 of Diamonds\n\nNo other effects to consider. This will secure the win. The final plan is to play the Three of a Kind.\n\n\n"
