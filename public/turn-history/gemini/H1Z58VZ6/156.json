{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Boss Fight: The Arm**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's Ante 5/8, Round 14, and the Blind is \"The Arm,\" which, annoyingly, reduces the level of the hand I play. My goal is to hit 22,000 chips. Currently, I've got a solid setup with Ride the Bus, Brainstorm (copying Ride the Bus), Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and DNA. I'm focusing on High Card, Level 7 – it's base 65 with a mult of 7.\n\nMy Jokers are set. Ride the Bus gives +21 Mult, and Brainstorm is currently copying that. I've got Blue Joker, giving me +150 Chips, and Mail-In Rebate, giving +10 mult, and DNA at +50 chips. My current thinking is that I'll get an expected score of 15,635 per hand (265 Chips * 59 Mult).\n\nThe Arm is annoying, because it reduces the hand level AFTER I play. With the current setup, if I play two hands, I can reach ~30,000, which is enough to beat the 22,000 chip target. My plan is to play High Card at Level 7 for the first hand, and then a Level 6 hand for the second. With the base level dropping from 7 to 6, and factoring in the multipliers, that should take me past the requirement. I should hit the 22,000 requirement.\n\nNo need to reroll; I'm pretty comfortable. No point in using consumables yet; I'll wait to see what hand I get. I want the Empress or the Moon to actually be useful.\n\nI need to confirm the best Joker setup. Is Brainstorm copying Ride the Bus still the best move? If I move Brainstorm to Blue Joker, the numbers become better, but Ride the Bus permanently gets +1 mult for each hand I play. If I play two hands: the first hand Ride the Bus is +21, Brainstorm copying +21. Second hand Ride the Bus is +22, Brainstorm copying +22. That's better. Ride the Bus's scaling makes that better in the long run.\n\nI need to enter the round. I'm confident in my Joker setup, and my plan. The plan should be: use DNA for the first card. I should be fine. It works on the first hand if it only has one card. Now, let's verify again: Base 65/7. +150 (Blue), +50 (DNA), +21 (Bus), +21 (Brainstorm), +10 (Mail-In) -> 265 * 59 = 15,635. I will play two hands for 30,000.\n\nLet's go.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
