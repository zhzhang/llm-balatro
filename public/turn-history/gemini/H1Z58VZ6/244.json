{"reasoning":"**Ante 7/8 - Tactical Shop Decisions**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8 with $51 in the bank. The immediate goal is to maximize score and set ourselves up for the higher antes. Right now, our hand is pretty solid with that DNA Joker (foil!), Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker. The Tower consumable is nice to have. Our high card level is at 13 which gives a solid multiplier.\n\nMy first thought is to evaluate the shop. The Moon is useless for my strategy. The Devious Joker is, again, not valuable for a High Card strategy. We have two options: The Jumbo Standard Pack, and the Blank voucher. The Standard Pack is the priority right now, given the strategy around the Steel Joker and DNA.\n\nThe Blank Voucher seems like the better long-term progression play that leads to an extra Joker slot. But with $51, it's not a major issue to buy now to reach the purchase requirement.\n\nI'm initially considering buying both, starting with the Blank voucher. But, looking again, I've got to prioritize ONE action. With $51, the Jumbo Standard Pack ($4) is definitely the play, with the *hope* of finding a Steel card. That Steel card, when copied with DNA Joker, can have a massive impact.\n\nI had to be sure, so I checked. Buying the Standard Pack is the best move. It's the highest-value option right now. I have enough money that I can afford to reroll the shop if needed, but a pack is likely better value.\n\nThe command is `buy_booster 1`, corresponding to the Jumbo Standard Pack. It's time to find that Steel card!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
