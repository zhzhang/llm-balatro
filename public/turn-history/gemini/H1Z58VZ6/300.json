{"reasoning":"**Current Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 8, Round 26, and I'm in the SHOP phase. I've got $31, which means I'm comfortably above the interest cap of $25. My current Joker lineup is DNA (Foil), Brainstorm (Holo), Ride the Bus (+36 Mult), Steel Joker (X4.2 Mult), and Blue Joker (+200 Chips). I also have \"The Tower\" consumable. I'm running a High Card strategy, currently at Level 16, which means I really need to maximize my score here.\n\nLooking at the shop, \"Splash\" is useless for me, as I don't use the tagged mechanic. \"The Devil\" would turn a card into Gold, which could be okay, but I'd rather have Steel cards for my Steel Joker to multiply. I don't need \"The Devil\" with the money I currently have.\n\nThe vouchers I have are generally good, but don't help me right now. Telescope is active, so I'm guaranteed to find Pluto in Celestial packs.\n\nMy primary goal is to maximize High Card scoring. My Steel Joker is at a decent X4.2 multiplier, but could always be higher. Blue Joker is at +200 Chips, and Ride the Bus is at +36 Mult. Brainstorm is copying DNA, and that's an excellent setup for duplicating key cards, especially Steel cards.\n\n\"The Devil\" looks enticing, but I can't use it now because it requires a card in hand and I'm in the shop. I would need to *buy* it and *then* wait to use it in the round phase. I have \"The Tower\" already, so if I bought \"The Devil\", I'd have to use it immediately.\n\nRerolling the shop is $5, and with $31 that's an excellent value to look for Pluto (via Celestial packs) or the Chariot (via Tarot packs). Right now, the shop is a bit underwhelming. Selling a Joker is out of the question; my current setup is solid. I can't use \"The Tower\" in the shop, as it requires a card in hand. Interest will cap soon, so I should be strategic with my money.\n\nSo, I think I'll reroll the shop once, maybe twice, to try for a Celestial or Tarot Pack. The shop is unlikely to get better on its own.\n\nBefore I commit, I have to consider the arrangement of my Jokers. DNA in slot 1 and Brainstorm in slot 2 is *perfect* for this High Card deck because I can clone Steel cards or Blue Seal cards. No change needed.\n\nAlright, I'm rerolling.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
