{"reasoning":"**My Strategy for Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6/8, Round 15. The game step is PLANET_PACK. I've got $47 to work with, and my immediate goal is to rebuild my \"High Card\" strength after that brutal \"The Arm\" boss blind. My most played hand, by far, is High Card (22 times). I'm leveraging the \"Telescope\" voucher, which guarantees the Planet card for my most played hand in the Celestial Packs.\n\nLooking at my options, I have:\n\n1.  Pluto (High Card)\n2.  Earth (Full House)\n3.  Mars (Four of a Kind)\n\nHigh Card is currently at level 5. Getting back to, and exceeding, that level is the core of my plan to recover from the Boss Blind. The fact that the \"Telescope\" voucher ensured Pluto was in this pack makes the decision easy. Leveling up High Card is absolutely essential right now.\n\nThe command to select a card from the booster pack is `select <pack_card_position>`, and Pluto is at position 1 in the list.\n\nTherefore, my action is `select`, and the position is `[1]` – selecting Pluto.\n\nThis is the key step in executing my plan to restore High Card. I'm focusing on bringing my High Card Hand back.\nI'm sending this command: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`.\nThe other fields, like `intended_hand_type` and `estimated_chips` are irrelevant to picking a planet card.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
