{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current Round and Planning the Optimal Play**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 13, ante 5/8, and I need to hit 11,000 chips total to win. Currently, I have 6,562, which means I'm short 4,438.  I have three hands left. I've got $28, and a few Jokers and Consumables.\n\nI've got a decent hand, but I need to optimize. My Jokers are: DNA (useless for the round, since it only activates on the first hand), Brainstorm (currently copying DNA, also useless), Blue Joker (+126 chips), Mail-In Rebate (+10 mult, $5 for discarded Aces), and Ride the Bus (+18 mult). I also have \"The Chariot\", which is a Steel card, and right now I have a Stone Card (+50 chips) I'll be using.\n\nRight now, Brainstorm is just copying DNA, which is pointless because I've already played a hand this round. The obvious move is to rearrange the Jokers so Brainstorm copies Blue Joker, giving me an immediate +252 chips.  I've got The Chariot consumable, which is *important* and two Wild cards.\n\nHere's the plan. I need to get the *most* out of The Chariot, and the wild cards.\n\nOkay, let's work this through. I could use The Chariot on either of the 10s (Mult), the 4 (Bonus), or the Stone Card.  I don't *really* need the extra 30 chips from the bonus, or the +4 from a Mult. The Chariot turns a card into a Steel card which is a x1.5 multiplier. Since I have Ride the Bus, I can get that benefit. The bonus chip benefit is only 30.\n\nSo: The Chariot on the 4 of Diamonds. This turns it into a Steel Card (x1.5 mult while in hand).  Then, discard the Wild 10s. This requires *two* consumables, and I only have one, so I *must* use The Chariot before I can discard the wild cards. Discarding the wild cards generates Tarot cards. Then, rearrange my Jokers, and play the Stone card.\n\nI *need* to use the consumable. So I'll use The Chariot on the 4 of Diamonds, card 5. This frees up space. Now I have 2 slots for Tarot cards.\n\nLet me double check the command: `use_consumable <consumeable_position> <target_card_position1> ...`. Makes sense.\n\nI have 1 of 2 consumables. Consumable 1: Chariot.\nSo the next *immediate* action, is to use `use_consumable 1 5`.\n\nThe action I've selected, the first step, is `use_consumable` with positions [1, 5].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 5], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}\n```\n\nOkay, I'm ready to move forward.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,5]"}
