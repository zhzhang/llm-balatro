{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Celestial Pack: High Card and a Secondary Plan**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 8, Round 24 – time to wrap up this shop and get ready for the next one. We're in a Mega Celestial Pack, specifically the `PLANET_PACK` (Mega Celestial Pack). My inventory is looking pretty solid: DNA (Foil), Brainstorm, Ride the Bus (+34 Mult), Steel Joker (X3.4), Blue Joker (+184 Chips), and The Tower consumable. I have $40 to work with, but this pack is already paid for.\n\nThe core of this build is a High Card engine, as I've played it 33 times already. \"Ride the Bus\" is crucial because it gives me mult for not playing face cards. The \"Steel Joker\" loves Steel Cards, so I should see how many of those are in my deck.\n\nI've already chosen Pluto (High Card) and now need to pick a second card from the pack, and there are a few options: Earth (Full House), Uranus (Two Pair), Venus (Three of a Kind), and Jupiter (Flush).\n\nLooking at the hand level data, High Card is Level 16 – just upgraded from Level 15! I have already played Three of a Kind 2 times, a pair 1 time, and a Flush 1 time.\n\nThe most logical choice here is to bolster a secondary hand that may come into play. Three of a Kind (Venus) is already at Level 3, and Two Pair (Uranus) is level 1, so going for the Three of a Kind seems the best choice.\n\nLet's quickly confirm those hand counts before committing:\nThree of a Kind: 2\nTwo Pair: 0\nFull House: 0\nFlush: 1\nPair: 1\nHigh Card: 33\n\nLooks like Three of a Kind is the logical fallback.\n\nBack to the pack options:\n1: Earth (Full House)\n2: Uranus (Two Pair)\n3: Venus (Three of a Kind)\n4: Jupiter (Flush)\n\nSo, that’s position 3, Venus. Action: `select 3`. This seems like the right move given the circumstances.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
