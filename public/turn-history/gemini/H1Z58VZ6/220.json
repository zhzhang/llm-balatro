{"reasoning":"**Current State and Immediate Action**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm in Ante 6, Round 19, Shop phase, and I've got a healthy $52 in the bank. My immediate goal is to reach Ante 8's boss, and my current strategy is a High Card build, heavily leveraging DNA for consistent chip generation, Ride the Bus for additive multipliers, and Steel Joker and Brainstorm for multiplicative power.\n\nMy hand level for High Card is already at 9, which is solid, and I'm using the Telescope voucher, so I know I'll be guaranteed to pull Pluto from Celestial Packs to further boost my High Card. Right now I have 5 Jokers equipped, all of which are good: a Steel Joker at X2.2, Brainstorm (which is copying Steel), Ride the Bus (+27 Mult), DNA (+50 Chips, copies first hand card) and a Blue Joker (+158 Chips).\n\nLooking at the shop, the Green Joker and Acrobat aren't particularly appealing given my current setup. The Standard Pack is tempting for potentially adding more Steel cards, which would boost Steel Joker's multiplier, but I'm hesitant to dilute my deck too much. However, DNA also adds cards. The Jumbo Celestial Pack, though, is the clear winner here, and I'm ready to pull the trigger on it. It's only $4, and it's guaranteed to give me Pluto cards, which will directly level up my High Card.\n\nHere's my breakdown: my current calculation for my total score this round (300 chips * 36 mult * 4.84 multiplier) easily exceeds the target of 30,000 for Ante 6, and I think it will put me well on my way to hitting that 60,000 mark for the boss. Plus, there is not a clear advantage from moving the Brainstorm joker.\n\nMy action: I'm buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack. So the plan is to buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack right now. No need for a reroll, no need to overthink it. `buy_booster 2`. That's that.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
