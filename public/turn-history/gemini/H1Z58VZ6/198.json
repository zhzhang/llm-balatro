{"reasoning":"**Analysis of Jumbo Arcana Pack in High Card Build**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6/8, Round 18. I've got $21, and this Jumbo Arcana Pack is staring me in the face. My goal is to use this pack to get something that scales the Steel Joker or otherwise improves the High Card strategy. I'm running High Card, currently at Level 9 (85 chips, 9x Multiplier). I have a decent set of Jokers already: Steel Joker (X2.2), Brainstorm (copying Steel), Ride the Bus (+26 chips), DNA (+50 chips), and Blue Joker (+144 chips). The primary goal is to scale the Steel Joker.\n\nLet's break down these cards:\n\n1.  **The High Priestess:** This *could* give me Pluto (High Card) cards, which would be amazing for leveling up. I have the Telescope voucher, so planet packs are reliable, but this is random.\n2.  **The Fool:** This will copy the last Tarot or Planet card I used. I haven't used any cards from this shop yet, so I have no idea what it will do.\n3.  **The Magician:** This enhances two cards to \"Lucky.\" Okay, but I don't think it is strategy-defining.\n4.  **Justice:** This gives Glass cards, which are X2 Multiplier but fragile, and I depend on Steel cards for my Steel Joker.\n5.  **The Tower:** Stone cards add +50 chips and don't have a rank or suit. Stone cards *score* as High Card (if they are the highest/only card played) and add chips.\n\n*   My Steel Joker passive is based on Steel cards *in the deck*. Steel cards *in hand* just provide X1.5. So, I need more Steel cards.\n*   I can't directly improve the Steel Joker with this pack, I need to get Steel cards into the deck.\n*   The Tower's Stone Card would be good for scoring High Card and synergizes with Stone Joker (in shop, didn't buy).\n\nThinking it over, the best card here seems to be The High Priestess, because that *could* provide Pluto. \"The Fool\" will be useless (since I haven't used any tarot cards this run).\n\nWait, the current hand is: Lucky Ace, Steel 5, Ace, King, Gold Ace, Queen, Wild 10, Gold 2. The Tower would let me turn one of those into Stone cards. Stone cards help High Card builds. The High Priestess might give me Pluto.\n\nI could skip, but I should improve the deck.\n\nThe problem is the Steel Joker passive. Steel cards in the full deck increase the passive. The Tower's Stone Card doesn't help with the passive, but does help score High Card.\n\nThe High Priestess could provide Pluto. If I get Pluto, it takes the High Card level to 10. And I have the Telescope, so the best place to get Pluto is a Celestial pack. There's nothing in the pack that directly helps Steel scaling.\n\nIf I had the Stone Joker, The Tower would be great, but I didn't buy it.\n\nI'll select The High Priestess (1). High Priestess has the highest ceiling. If I get Pluto, that is best for the build.\n\nOkay, wait. If I select The Tower, and use it on the King of Clubs (4) I remove the King of Clubs rank status, which protects \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nI'll go with High Priestess to gamble for Pluto.\n\nOkay, let's re-examine my thought process: The Tower for face card removal helps consistency (in case I do have to play the face card) and base chips. The High Priestess has high variance (Pluto). DNA means I don't need to play face cards.\n\nI'll take the High Priestess. The Fool will give Mars (useless). The Tower is good, but High Priestess is better.\n\nI'll choose High Priestess. Level 9 is 85 chips, 9 mult. Level 10 is 95 chips, 10 mult. Stone card is +50 chips. My chips are very high (144 + 50 + 85 = 279). High Priestess is 2 chances at Pluto.\n\nSo, High Priestess is the best choice (1). I need to select a single card from the pack. I'll go with High Priestess (1).\n\nSo here it is:\n\n*   **Action**: \"select\"\n*   **Positions**: `[1]`\n\nThat's my final answer. I'll go\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
