{"reasoning":"**Strategic Poker Hand Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 13, small blind, and I need to earn 4,438 more chips to hit the 11,000 target. I have 3 hands to make this happen. Let's see... I've got a hand with four 10s and a 4D Bonus card and I'm currently at Level 6 High Card.\n\nMy Jokers are key here. I have a DNA, two Brainstorms (currently copying DNA), a Blue Joker (+126 chips), Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. My current constraint is that the Brainstorms are only copying DNA which is pretty useless now as I've already played one hand. So the goal is to rearrange those Jokers. I also have two consumables. I have The Chariot (steel card) and The Empress (mult cards).\n\nI need to make the best use of these consumables before rearranging jokers. The Chariot can turn one card into a Steel card and the Empress can give +4 mult each to two other cards. I could use The Empress on the standard 10s.\n\nHowever, I've got a better idea. Before playing, I need to rearrange those Jokers and use the Empress. Then I will play a high card.\n\nI will use The Empress at position 2 to enhance the 10 of Spades and 10 of Diamonds. That is a +8 mult bonus!\n\nSo, the action is to `use_consumable 2 1 2`. \n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,1,2]"}
