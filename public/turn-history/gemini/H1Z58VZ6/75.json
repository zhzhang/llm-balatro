{"reasoning":"**My Calculated Play: Prioritizing High Card Scaling**\n\nAlright, I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase after opening a Celestial Pack. Let's break this down systematically. I've got $19, a few Jokers – DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus – and one Death consumable. I also have the Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale Vouchers. My current hand levels are High Card Level 3 and Three of a Kind Level 3. High Card is my most played hand, used 8 times.\n\nNow, looking at the pack choices: Pluto (High Card), Mercury (Pair), and Saturn (Straight). The Telescope Voucher confirms that the Planet card related to my most played hand, High Card, will be available, and as expected, Pluto is indeed there in position 1.\n\nGiven that I'm clearly pursuing a High Card build, this is the obvious choice. Picking Pluto will level up High Card from Level 3 to Level 4, which is significant. The base chips increase from 25 to 35, and the base multiplier goes from 3 to 4. This is the most optimal move to scale my scoring for the High Card strategy.\n\nSo, the action is to `select` position `[1]`, which is Pluto. The `intended_hand_type` is clearly \"high card,\" and the estimated chips at this stage are irrelevant; they'll be calculated in the next phase.\n\nI need to `select 1` immediately.\n\nI need to confirm:\n\n*   The `action` is \"select.\"\n*   The `positions` are `[1]`.\n*   The `intended_hand_type` is \"high card.\"\n*   `estimated_chips` is irrelevant now.\n\nI don't need to use the Death consumable yet, and selling it is not necessary. I don't need to rearrange Jokers either, as Brainstorm is already on DNA. Selling a Joker isn't warranted either. So yes, my action will be `select` position `1`. I definitely do not need to `skip_booster`.\n\nAgain, confirm:\n\n*   The `action` is \"select.\"\n*   The `positions` are `[1]`.\n*   The `intended_hand_type` is \"high card.\"\n*   `estimated_chips` is still irrelevant.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
