{"reasoning":"**Balatro: Round Optimization**\n\nOkay, here we go. We're in Round 19, Small Blind, need 20,000 chips, and I have just $13. I've got a decent hand, but I need to make some strategic moves. Let's see... the Jokers are: Ride the Bus (+26 Mult), Steel Joker (X2.2 Mult), Brainstorm (copies leftmost Joker), DNA (copies first-played card), and Blue Joker (+130 chips). Okay, I need to get the most bang for my buck here.\n\nI need to maximize my multiplier with Brainstorm. I've got to make sure it copies the Steel Joker for maximum effect. I've been here before. I need to get the Steel Joker to the leftmost slot. Let me check the joker order... Okay, the *previous* move was `rearrange_jokers 3 1 2 4 5`. And it appears that *didn't* work as I expected. Let's check the current state: I'm currently on Ride the Bus at index 1, Steel Joker at 2, and Brainstorm at 3. The command `rearrange_jokers 3 1 2 4 5` moves Ride the Bus (3) to index 1, Steel Joker (1) to 2, and Brainstorm (2) to 3. Got it. So that *was* correct. The previous thinking was correct.\n\nBut is that the *best* order? Ride the Bus and Brainstorm both add to the base multiplier, and Steel Joker adds a multiplier. It's better to have Brainstorm copy the Steel Joker. The previous logic was sound. (Base + 52) * 2.2 vs (Base + 26) * 4.84. Clearly, the latter wins. So, if Steel Joker is at the leftmost spot, I get the maximum multiplier. Now, let's see, do I need to rearrange Jokers, *or* is there a more pressing need?\n\nOkay, Consumables are: The Star and Judgement, and I have 2/2 consumables. The hand is: 9S, 3S, 7H, 5H (Gold), 9C, AceD (Gold), AceD (Gold), 7D, 2D (Gold). I've got the DNA Joker active - so playing a single card will trigger it. And the Goal is simple: 20,000. Scaling: use DNA on something good. Resource management: keep Gold cards for end of round money. Joker optimization: Brainstorm needs to copy Steel Joker. Tarot generation: Discarding the 9S should give a Tarot card *if* I have room for it. Right now I have no room (2/2).\n\nOkay, I need to get rid of *something* to get that tarot. Can't score a face card with Ride the Bus active. But that is not a factor. \n\nSo, priority: 1) Rearrange Jokers, 2) sell Judgement, 3) Discard 9S for Tarot, 4) Play a good card.\n\nLet's check the order again.\n1: Ride the Bus\n2: Steel Joker\n3: Brainstorm\nI need Steel Joker at 1 and Brainstorm at 2. So, command is `rearrange_jokers 2 3 1 4 5`.\n\nOkay, let's stop. I can *sell* Judgement and *then* discard the 9S, getting a Tarot. If I play the 7H with the Gold cards in hand, how much do I get? If I sell Judgement, and Discard, and play 7H, I win.\n\nLet me calculate. High Card (7H) with the multipliers: 272 chips * 39 mult * 4.84 x multiplier = win. Yes! 51,342 chips! I win. Easy.\n\nBut how do I maximize?\nPriorities:\n1. Win round (easy).\n2. Trigger DNA (7H).\n3. Keep Gold Cards (money).\n4. Keep Ride the Bus scaling.\n5. Get/Use Tarots.\n\nSo, Step 1: Sell Judgement (Consumable 2). Step 2: Discard 9S to get a Tarot. Step 3: Play 7H.\n\nCan I do all that in a single turn? No. One command/action.\n\nLet's look. Consumables are at the top of the action. Action: `sell_consumable 2`.\n\nCan I rearrange jokers? It takes a single action. And\n\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
