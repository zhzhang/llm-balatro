{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Emperor or Bust?**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7, Round 22, and I'm in a TAROT_PACK. Currently sitting on $40, five Jokers (DNA, Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker), and one consumable (The Tower) with a max of two. The hand is decent but leaning towards a High Card strategy: a Lucky Ace of Hearts, King of Clubs, Gold Ace of Diamonds, King of Diamonds, Queen of Diamonds, Wild and Mult 10 of Diamonds, and a 3 of Diamonds. My core goal here is to maximize score with a High Card build while continuing to scale the Steel Joker and DNA Jokers.\n\nThe pack choices are: Justice (Glass enhancement), The Emperor (2 random Tarots), and Strength (+1 rank). I need to weigh these carefully.\n\nJustice offers a x2 Multiplier on a card, but the Glass cards are fragile and risk breaking. Strength is essentially useless for a High Card build since I have mostly non-face cards. Then there's The Emperor. Initially, I thought that with only one slot open for consumables, The Emperor would only create one tarot card. However, given it's a Tarot Pack, using The Emperor *will* give me a strong chance to snag The Chariot (Steel), Death (copying power), or maybe even the Hermit (money). The key is the potential to get a Steel card to benefit from Steel Joker. The immediate scoring boost from Justice is tempting, but the long-term scaling potential with The Emperor is much higher.\n\nMy build hinges on High Card, and Steel Joker scales with the *entire* deck's Steel cards. DNA is ready to create copies of cards, which I can strategically use later. I need more Steel cards to make that Joker really sing. The Emperor offers the best chance of finding these crucial cards. Justice isn't bad but is limited in impact. Strength is a no-go for High Card. The Emperor seems like the high-value play.\n\nI need to quickly assess. If I select The Emperor, I can fill the empty slot. Should I sell The Tower first? No, since I can hold another one. Selecting The Emperor is more of a long-term play.\n\nI have 11 Steel cards already in the deck. The Steel Joker is already worth x3.2, so an Emperor could make the Steel Joker even stronger.\n\nSo, Justice gives immediate power, but The Emperor is the best choice here.\n\n**Action: `select` position `2`** - Let's see what the Emperor bestows.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
