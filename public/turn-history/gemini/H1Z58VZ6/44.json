{"reasoning":"**Next Move Analysis: Balatro**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Blind Select phase of Ante 2, Round 5. The boss is \"The Window,\" which debuffs Diamonds. I need to hit 1600 chips to clear this. Currently, I have $2, and the Magician consumable. Looking at my Jokers, I've got: Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, Scholar, and DNA.\n\nThe immediate thing is to figure out the right Joker order, then decide on a hand to play. DNA is a \"on played\" joker, so its placement is slightly different. Other than that, the relative position of the others is less relevant, but I should check anyway.\n\nI can't use the Magician now since I'm in the blind phase. Selling it is pointless given my low cash. I should enter the round first. Looking at the action choices, I can *only* play a round, the other choices are impossible.\n\nLet's check the Joker order. My thinking is that the *order* of the jokers doesn't matter too much (at the moment), as everything is added together: chips, then mult, then mult applied. Since I'm not dealing with *x Mult* jokers, their relative position should be pretty inconsequential. However, for clarity, I should put DNA first since it modifies the first hand.\n\nMy current joker order is Mail-In, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, Scholar, DNA.\n\nThe current thought on the play is: Use DNA to double the Ace. Then score it. Ace (11) + Scholar (20) + Blue Joker (106) gives 142 chips * (Mail-In(10) + Ride the Bus (4) + Scholar(4)) = 19 mult = 2698 chips.\n\nThe command is `play_round`. So I'll go with that, and reassess after I see the hand.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
