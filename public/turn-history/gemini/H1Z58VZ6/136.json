{"reasoning":"**My turn, my thoughts...**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante is 5/8, round 13, small blind. My target is 11,000 chips; I need to make up 4,438. Got three hands left, one discard. $28 in the bank. Two consumables max, and I have two: The Empress and The Magician. Then there are some Jokers, including a Blue Joker and Brainstorm, which is copying the Blue. Plus DNA, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. My current hand has a nice mix – a bunch of 10s, a Queen, some fours, and a Stone Card.\n\nLet's see: the Jokers are contributing 379 chips and 34 mult, but the Steel card boosts that mult to 51. Playing the current hand would get me a solid 19,329 chips, which is way over what I need. The aim is to get enough chips while making the most of my resources for the long term.\n\nOkay, I need to keep the Ride the Bus joker multiplier going. I cannot score a face card, so that Queen of Diamonds has to go. And the Wild 10 also needs to go to get a tarot. I want to use or sell a consumable to make room.\n\nI have one discard, and that Wild 10 (card 5) creates a tarot card if I discard it with space. I've got The Empress and The Magician. Do I use The Magician on cards 1 and 4? Or on the 4s? I'm already getting great Multi from Ride the Bus, so I might as well use The Magician to free up space.\n\nAction: use The Magician on cards 4 (10 of Diamonds) and 6 (4 of Diamonds). Then discard the Queen (card 3) and the Wild 10 (Card 5). Play the Stone card.\n\nI still need to use a consumable before I can discard the tarot card. Do I want to use The Magician or The Empress?\n\nI've already played one hand this round, so DNA is out. \"Ride the Bus\" gains +1 mult *per hand played* without scoring a face card.\n\nSince I am discarding the Wild card, the consumable slot needs to be freed up.\n\nOkay, let's look again: Using The Magician, which makes Lucky cards, seems reasonable. The Empress would make Multi cards. But I think I need to free up a slot rather than focusing on the power of either joker. I'll stick to using The Magician.\n\nUsing Magician on the two 10s is fine.\n\nAction: `use_consumable 2 4 6` (Using Magician on Cards 4 and 6).\n\nWait, should I just sell the consumable? No, using it offers more value.\n\nOne final check. It's time to trigger that tarot! Using Magician is the plan, and there is space to discard a card and gain a tarot. Let's make this happen! Time to act!\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,4,6]"}
