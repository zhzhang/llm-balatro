{"reasoning":"**Round 11 - The Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 11, the Ante is 4/8, and I'm sitting on $33. The Boss Blind is \"The Club\" which debuffs Clubs, but that shouldn't impact my strategy. I need 10,000 chips.\n\nMy hand level is High Card Level 6, which gives me 55 Chips and 6 Mult, which is a nice starting point. My Jokers are where the real power is:\n\n*   **DNA:** Rare, adds a copy of the single card played to the deck on the first hand and draws a copy to the hand.\n*   **Brainstorm:** Rare, copies the ability of the leftmost Joker.\n*   **Blue Joker:** +134 Chips, scales with deck size.\n*   **Mail-In Rebate (Holo):** Common, +10 Mult, and gives $5 for each discarded rank.\n*   **Ride the Bus:** +15 Mult, scales with non-face card hands.\n\nThe key here is the DNA and Brainstorm combo. Since Brainstorm copies the *leftmost* Joker's ability, I've got it set up so that Brainstorm copies DNA. The plan is to play only a single card on the first hand, triggering DNA twice – once from DNA itself and once from Brainstorm. This creates two permanent copies of that card in the deck, which sets me up for the late game. I'm leveraging the deck size scaling that Blue Joker has.\n\nFor the first hand, I need Brainstorm copying DNA, but for subsequent hands, Brainstorm copying either Blue Joker (for chips) or Ride the Bus (for mult) will be best.\n\nWith DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate (Holo), and Ride the Bus, here’s my chip and mult breakdown:\n\n*   Base: 55 Chips, 6 Mult.\n*   Blue Joker: +134 Chips.\n*   Mail-In Rebate (Holo): +10 Mult.\n*   Ride the Bus: +15 Mult.\n\nThat gives me 189 Chips and 31 Mult for the initial hand (before applying Ride the Bus). If I can set things up in the subsequent hand so Brainstorm copies Ride the Bus, my score will be quite high (46 Mult).\n\nFirst-hand score: 189 Chips * 31 Mult = 5,859.\nSubsequent-hand score: 189 Chips * 46 Mult = 8,694.\nTotal estimated score: 5,859 + 8,694 = 14,553.\n\nI need 10,000 chips. So even with a conservative estimate, I'm well above the target. Even the club debuff won't prevent this, because my cards are just going to scale using the jokers.\n\nI've confirmed my Joker order one last time: DNA (1), Brainstorm (2), Blue Joker (3), Mail-In Rebate (4), Ride the Bus (5). Brainstorm is copying DNA, and this is the best setup for the first hand.\n\nOkay, everything checks out. I have no consumables, and I don't need to rearrange anything before entering the round. Time to execute.\n\nMy action: `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
