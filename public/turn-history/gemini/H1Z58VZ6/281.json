{"reasoning":"**Analyzing Endgame Options: Reroll Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 8, Round 24 with $25 left. My build is High Card focused, leveraging Steel cards through DNA and Brainstorm to scale Steel Joker, and Ride the Bus for massive multiplier scaling. I've got a Tower consumable enhancing stone cards. The current shop cards, Delayed Gratification and Uranus, are totally useless.\n\nMy immediate goal is to find Pluto cards or Celestial/Standard packs. With the Telescope and Planet Merchant Vouchers, the odds are in my favor to find these high value cards.\n\nAt $6 per reroll, it's a trade-off. Rerolling costs $6, leaving me with $19, but I keep the potential to improve my current board, while only yielding $3 in interest. I'm currently capped on the interest I can gain ($5). I don't need to sell or use any existing Jokers or consumables, and I have Brainstorm copying DNA, which is the perfect setup for card generation.\n\nI'm confident I can make the best decision for my game state.\n\nInitially, I looked at the shop: no. Then, I weighed going to the round with $25 vs. rerolling with $19. A reroll is worth losing $2, which is worth it in Ante 8. The odds of finding a pack or Pluto are better than the $2 interest.\n\nMy decision: **`reroll_shop`**. That's it. I'm hitting the shop again. Hopefully, this time, I'll find something better.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
