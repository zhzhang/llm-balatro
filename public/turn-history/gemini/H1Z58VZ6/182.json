{"reasoning":"**Deep Dive: Shop Strategy & Optimization**\n\nOkay, so we're in the shop, Ante 5, and got a decent amount of money. The Needle boss is a joke, no worries there. Current focus: scaling up for the long game. I'm running a High Card build with Ride the Bus and Blue Joker as my engines. Steel Joker is the long-term multiplier. DNA is clutch for creating Steel cards/Blue Joker, and Brainstorm is gravy.\n\nRight now, the shop's mediocre, but I see opportunity.  Red Card is a dud, takes too long to build up. The High Priestess, on the other hand, is interesting. It *could* give me a Pluto card, which is the best for High Card.  I have one consumable (The Moon) but only room for one more. If I buy the High Priestess and it makes two planets, I'm screwed. I need the room. Selling The Moon for one dollar gives me the room needed. Now I have 2 consumable slots. Selling \"The Moon\" gets me $1. Then buying the High Priestess only costs $1 overall. This will give me a 2/2 chance for planets and the potential for a Pluto.\n\nI'm thinking, since I'm already cruising, I should optimize for the future. The most efficient scaling is through Celestial Packs. So my priority is finding Pluto cards. High Priestess is a cheap gamble. But Rerolling the shop to hunt for Celestial Packs is probably even better.\n\nHold on, before I rush, *let's think*. I need to buy the High Priestess.  And I'm at 1/2 consumable slots, so I have to sell The Moon.\n\nOkay, let's step back, what commands are available?  I can't \"use\" The Moon right now because no cards are on the table.\n\nSelling the Moon is the only viable option in the shop at this moment.\n\n*Alternative*: I could buy and use the High Priestess. If I have 1/2 slots, it creates 1 planet. Is this worth it? Maybe. If I sell The Moon, then I have the ability to buy two planets. Selling The Moon gets $1, and the High Priestess costs $2 - thus, if I sell and *then* buy it becomes $1, giving me two planets! Action B is far superior.\n\nThis all makes me think that maybe I should be rerolling the shop, but, I will sell the moon and *then* look.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  Current order: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, DNA, Steel Joker.\n2.  Better order: DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, Steel Joker.\n\nSince I am not entering the round, I can re-arrange.\nFirst I want to focus on economy and items.\n\nI must *sell consumable 1*.\nIn the next round, if I find a celestial pack, I will purchase it.\n\nSo I am going to sell the consumable.\n\nFinal check on the commands:\n`sell_consumable <consumeable_position>`\n`positions` should be `[1]`.\n\nThe Red Card is not worth it, despite being +3 mult per skipped booster.\n\nSelling the Moon is the best move here.\nI can then buy the High Priestess, which will give me a shot at getting a Pluto.\n\nLet's do this. I'll sell the Moon. The next turn, let's try to find a planet by buying and using the High Priestess.\n\n\n","action":"\"sell_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
