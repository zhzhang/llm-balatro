{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Prioritizing Long-Term Multiplier Growth**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my current thought process. We're in Round 3, Standard Pack, with $7 and these Jokers: Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Red Card, Blue Joker, and Scholar. I also have the Telescope Voucher. The goal, as always, is to hit that chip threshold for the round. The overarching strategy I've been cultivating is to lean heavily into those multiplier-building Jokers, specifically Ride the Bus and, most importantly, Red Card.\n\nRight now, I'm faced with these Standard Pack choices: Jack of Hearts, a 3 of Hearts (Gold card!), and a Jack of Spades (Mult/Retrigger!).  \n\nBased on my prior turns (26 & 27), the *explicit* strategy has been to skip booster packs in order to maximize Red Card's permanent Mult bonus.  I need to consider whether +3 permanent Mult is better than adding a Gold card or a potentially powerful Mult/Retrigger card. Let's weigh this: The Red Card offers a global +3 Mult *to every hand*, which is substantial.  The Jack of Spades, while Mult/Retrigger, is only valuable *if* played and scored, and that's the kicker. Ride the Bus is currently at +2 Mult and punishes playing face cards, so grabbing the Jack of Spades and playing it will reset my current streak. That's a deal-breaker!\n\nWhile the 3 of Hearts is decent, that +3 global Mult from Red Card is generally more potent in the long run than a single Gold card. It directly aligns with the established strategy of foregoing the booster for Red Card. Thus, the reasoning and the action are both clear.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to `skip_booster`. I'm executing the pre-planned strategy by skipping the pack to trigger the Red Card's ability for a permanent +3 Mult. Plus, because I am leaning heavily on Ride the Bus, taking face cards (like those Jacks) would be detrimental to that strategy.\n\nSo, the action is `{\"action\": \"skip_booster\"}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
