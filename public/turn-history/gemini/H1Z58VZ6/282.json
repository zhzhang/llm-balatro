{"reasoning":"**The Endgame: Reroll for the Win**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 8, Round 24. This is it. The final boss is looming, and it's time to *really* optimize. My strategy is locked in: High Card, \"Ride the Bus\" style with a heavy dose of Steel card scaling. The goal is clear: maximize my chips and multiplier before the final showdown.\n\nCurrently, I've got $19, a reroll costs $7, and the current shop is... well, it's garbage. Seance and Runner? Useless. Not a single thing that contributes to the core plan.\n\nThe key pieces are in place. I have DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, and Blue Joker. The Tower helps with Stone Cards. High Card is already at level 16, which is good enough for now.\n\nThe real target is Pluto, either through the Celestial Pack or the Planet Merchant effect, which my Telescope can use. I’m thinking there might also be steel cards in the deck, but there's a low chance.\n\nThe question is, do I reroll? The cost is $7, which would leave me with $12. A Celestial Pack typically costs $6-$8. Even with the interest drop from $3 to $2, which is negligible, the potential payoff from a reroll is massive. Finding a Pluto card or even a key Steel card is worth far more than that single dollar of interest.\n\nThe shop cards are absolutely useless, so I'm not buying anything. I'm going to **reroll the shop**. This is the best move to maximize my ability to win against the final boss.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
