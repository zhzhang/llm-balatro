{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop - A Strategic Evaluation**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 4, Round 11. I've got $41 after purchasing the Celestial Pack. My current joker setup is pretty solid: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. I'm focusing on scaling \"Ride the Bus\" with my \"High Card\" strategy, which is currently at level 5.\n\nLet's break down the shop options. First, the Celestial Pack is a no-brainer. The Telescope voucher guarantees I get Pluto, which will upgrade my High Card to level 6 – critical for this strategy. The Standard Pack could be useful to expand the deck and make Blue Joker more potent, or to find key cards like Steel Kings. Riff-raff is a pass – I don’t want to sell any of my jokers for temporary power. Business Card is actively detrimental with my scaling strategy, so it's a hard no.\n\nMy primary focus is increasing the level of my High Card, so priority one is the Celestial Pack. I got Pluto. Now to consider what to do with the remaining money. Given my strong Joker engine, I'm thinking I should use my money to reroll the shop. While the Standard Pack would have utility, I might be better served by rerolling for a more powerful joker, preferably xMult, Constellation or Green Joker. Time to take the plunge and see what the shop gods offer!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
