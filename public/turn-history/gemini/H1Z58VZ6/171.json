{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5/8, Shop Phase, $53 in the bank. My goal, as always, is to maximize my score potential and build a strong economy for the future. I'm running a High Card build with a specific focus: \"Ride the Bus\" for scaling Mult, \"Brainstorm\" to copy it, \"Blue Joker\" for chips based on deck size, \"DNA\" for cloning high-value non-face cards (great for feeding Steel Joker), and \"Steel Joker\" for scaling Mult based on Steel cards. All five Joker slots are filled. My current Jokers are performing pretty well and I need to buy some packs to feed them with high level cards.\n\nI've got a solid setup with the current Jokers: Ride the Bus is solid, and Brainstorm is copying it. Blue Joker is providing a good amount of Chips and DNA is for cloning great non-face cards and Steel Joker is there to provide some scaling.\n\nNow, for the shop. \"Scary Face\" is a hard skip, as it conflicts with Ride the Bus's anti-face card effect. \"Shortcut\" is irrelevant for this High Card strategy, so that's out too.\n\nMy owned Tarot, `The Moon`, is a bit tempting, but I don't really need it right now.\n\nI also have access to two Celestial packs, and since I own `Telescope`, I'm guaranteed to get `Pluto` (High Card planet), which is currently at level 6. It's at a good level, giving me +55 Chips and +6 Mult. Definitely worth buying those packs to level it up further.\n\nSince I have plenty of money, buying both Celestial Packs is an absolute no-brainer to scale `Pluto`. I'll always be above $25 to maximize interest.\n\nThe jumbo pack is definitely a better value than the standard pack. The extra choice is a very nice option.\n\nI'm checking if I want to keep all my current Jokers. `DNA` is useful for generating Steel cards or high-rank non-face cards to feed `Steel Joker` and `Ride the Bus`. `Blue Joker` provides decent chips.\n\nSo, the plan: First, I'm buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack and the standard Celestial Pack. Then, I'll evaluate if I need to reroll to find better Jokers or Tarot packs. My Joker setup is already quite strong so I probably won't reroll.\n\nLet's start by buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack.\n\nI'll buy_booster, with position 2.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
