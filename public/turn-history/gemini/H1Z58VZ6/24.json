{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Action**\n\nOkay, so we're in Round 3, Ante 3/8, in the SHOP phase. I've got $7 and a decent Joker setup: Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Red Card (at 0 Mult, which is a key observation), Blue Joker, and Scholar. I'm at max Joker capacity, no consumables, and the shop is offering The Magician (Tarot), two $0 boosters (Jumbo Celestial and Standard), and a Hieroglyph voucher. Telescope is my active voucher (guaranteeing a Planet card if I play a Three of a Kind).\n\nMy main goal is to maximize score, but also think of long-term potential. I immediately see the opportunity to leverage the Red Card, which gains +3 Mult for *skipping* any Booster Pack. I can buy the free Jumbo Celestial and Standard packs, *then* choose to skip them to power up the Red Card.\n\nNow, because I have the Telescope, the Jumbo Celestial Pack is guaranteed to have Earth, which boosts Three of a Kind. Leveling up Three of a Kind gets me +20 Chips and +3 Mult. But is that better than the flat +6 Mult I can get on the Red Card? My initial assessment is the universality of the Red Card's Mult outweighs the Three of a Kind's level up, especially with Mail-In Rebate, which provides a flat Mult, and Ride the Bus, which rewards me for using non-face cards. To skip a booster, I must first buy it.\n\nI've already bought the Scholar on Turn 24. So, looking at the SHOP, I need to decide what to buy. The Magician is currently free. Since I don't need the Magician *now*, I can buy the boosters first. So, I will buy the Magician first. Then, buy the Jumbo Celestial pack. Then, buy the standard pack. The goal: skip the packs for the Red Card Mult.\n\nOkay, let's break this down into actionable commands. I will buy The Magician, then the Jumbo Celestial pack, then the Standard pack. The schema says I must use positional arguments, and \"buy_card\" will be used to purchase the Magician. Also, \"buy_booster\" will be used to purchase the two booster packs. I checked and re-checked the Red Card text: \"This Joker gains +3 Mult when any Booster Pack is skipped.\" I will skip them on the next turn.\n\nMy thought:\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_card\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
