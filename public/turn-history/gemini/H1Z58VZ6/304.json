{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Round 27, Targeting 100,000 Chips**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 8, aiming for 100,000 chips. We have a Crimson Heart boss blind, which means one random Joker is disabled each hand. DNA (Joker 3) is the unlucky one this time.\n\nLooking at the hand, we have a potentially strong setup. Key Jokers are: a Steel Joker (x4.2 Mult, x1.5 while in hand - *important to remember that secondary effect*), Brainstorm (copies the Steel Joker - good!), Ride the Bus (+36 Mult, watch for breaking), and Blue Joker (+182 Chips). We also have the Tower consumable, which is key to my strategy.\n\nMy initial thought is the Jack of Hearts will break Ride the Bus. I can't let that happen. The hand contains some good cards, so the main play is to use the Tower consumable on the Jack of Hearts. This turns it into a Stone Card, eliminating its rank and preventing Ride the Bus from breaking, and adding 50 chips. This is a solid play.\n\nThe Steel Joker and Brainstorm together are a multiplicative powerhouse. Let's see how much we can get. I have two Steel cards in hand which will multiply. Also, Steel Joker's secondary effect is crucial - a 1.5x multiplier while in hand.\n\n*   Chips: 155 base + 50 stone + 182 (Blue Joker) + 50 foil/other = ~437 chips.\n*   Mult: 16 (base) + 36 (Ride the Bus) = 62 mult.\n\nMy X-Mult is (4.2 * 4.2) (Steel Joker * Brainstorm) * (1.5 * 1.5) (Steel Cards) * 1.5 (Steel Joker) = ~59.5.\n\nScore: 437 * 62 * 59.5 = ~1.6 million chips. That's well over the target, so this is a great turn.\n\nI need to confirm the consumable action. Let's look at the Tower again. Jack of Hearts is at position 3, the Tower is at position 1. Okay, looks good. `use_consumable 1 3`. I can't discard now because I need the current hand to win.\n\nEverything checks out. `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 3]}`. This will do it.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,3]"}
