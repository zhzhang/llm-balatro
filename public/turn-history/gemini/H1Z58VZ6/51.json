{"reasoning":"**Acquiring the Clearance Sale Voucher**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this situation... I've got $17. The 'Clearance Sale' voucher is right there, staring me in the face at position 1. And the price? $10. Absolutely worth it, that's a no-brainer. This follows perfectly from the previous turn's logic. We already sold the Scholar, so that's done and dusted. Step one is clear: buy this voucher. After I get the 'Clearance Sale' voucher, I will buy the Brainstorm, which will drop in cost. I will then rearrange my Jokers, I have 4 of them. Now, let's execute the purchase. I will buy that voucher immediately.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
