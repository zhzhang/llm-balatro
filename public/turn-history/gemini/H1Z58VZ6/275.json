{"reasoning":"**Mega Celestial Pack Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the Mega Celestial Pack shop phase, and the goal is clear: pick two planet cards to beef up my poker hands. I'm running a High Card build, level 15, played 33 times. It's a pretty strong setup, considering the jokers I have: DNA (foil), Brainstorm to copy it, Ride the Bus (+34 Mult), Steel Joker (X3.4), and Blue Joker (+184 Chips). I'm also using the Telescope voucher, so Pluto/High Card is always in these packs, which is a big advantage for this build. I've got $40 in the bank, and two cards left to select in this Mega pack.\n\nLet's see what's on offer. I've got Pluto (High Card +1 Mult, +10 Chips) at level 15 already, which is the obvious choice. Then there's Earth (Full House +2 Mult, +25 Chips), Uranus (Two Pair +1 Mult, +20 Chips), Venus (Three of a Kind +2 Mult, +20 Chips) and Jupiter (Flush +2 Mult, +15 Chips), all at lower levels.\n\nGiven the current strategy heavily relies on High Card and these jokers, Pluto is the no-brainer here to level up that hand. Because it's a Mega pack, I get to pick a second card after Pluto. Once I pick Pluto, the card positions will shift.\n\nSo, the first action is clear: I'm selecting Pluto. This will immediately level up High Card. Since it's a Mega pack, the game state updates after that, and I'll need to make another selection.\n\nOkay, the prompt is asking for the JSON format. The action is \"select\", and the position I'm selecting is \"1\". Let's get that JSON ready: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`. Now I can move on to my next pick.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
