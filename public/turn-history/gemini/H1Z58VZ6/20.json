{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Boss Blind: Ready to Play**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 2, Round 2, the \"Blind Select\" phase. My goal is to beat the boss with the \"0 discards\" condition. This immediately makes \"Mail-In Rebate\" useless this round, so that's something to keep in mind. I need to score 1600 chips to win.\n\nI have these Jokers in play: \"Mail-In Rebate\" (Holo), \"Ride the Bus\", \"Red Card\", and \"Blue Joker\".  My current hand level is \"Three of a Kind\" at level 2, which gives me 50 chips and 5 mult as the base. The \"Coupon Tag\" is active, which means the next shop will have free cards/packs, a nice bonus after beating this blind.\n\nBased on my Jokers, I estimate that a hand will get me around 2310 chips (50 from base hand + 104 from Blue Joker times 15 mult from Mail-In Rebate and the hand). This is well above the 1600 needed. The order of these Jokers doesn't really matter since all modifiers are additive.\n\nMy available actions are limited to `play_round`, `use_consumable`, `sell_consumable`, `rearrange_jokers`, and `sell_joker`.  No consumables to use or sell, and no reason to sell any Jokers. The current phase is the blind select; no card selections have occurred yet.  So, the only logical action is `play_round`.  The schema requires an action, `positions` (which is `null` here), `intended_hand_type` (which I could include but I don't need to specify at the BLIND_SELECT screen), and estimated chips (I can include these as well).\n\nI don't need to rearrange jokers at this stage. It's a simple `play_round` command to enter the blind. I'm choosing to enter with the intent of playing three-of-a-kind.\n\nFinal decision: `play_round`.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
