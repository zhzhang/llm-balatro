{"reasoning":"**Round 24, \"The Eye\" Blind - High Card Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: 7/8 Ante, facing \"The Eye\" blind, needing 70,000 chips, with only $33 in the bank, and my current stack at zero. I have 4 hands and 3 discards. My inventory is looking pretty good, but this blind is going to put the pressure on to make sure this first hand counts. I've got DNA (Foil), Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, and Blue Joker in my Joker slots. Plus, I've got The Tower consumable, which will enhance a card to Stone.\n\nMy hand consists of the following: a Foil, Glass 10 of Hearts, 9 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, a regular 10 of Clubs, two wild 10 of Diamonds, a Lucky 4 of Diamonds, a 3 of Diamonds, and a Stone Card.\n\nThe strategy is clear: focus on a High Card play. I'm going to level it up as far as it can go: Level 15 (145 Chips, 15 Mult), to maximize the DNA utility.\n\nConsidering \"The Eye\" boss blind restriction, I can't repeat a hand type or I'll be eliminated. Luckily, I can bypass the restriction by one-shotting the blind with High Card.\n\nMy action from the last turn was to use Justice on the 10 of Hearts. Now, the 10 of Hearts (Foil) is now a 10 of Hearts (Foil, Glass).\n\nSo, the play is simple: Play the 10 of Hearts (Foil, Glass) as a High Card.\n\nHere's the chip calculation: High Card base is 145 chips and 15 Mult. The 10 of Hearts adds 60 chips (rank 10, plus 50 for the Foil). DNA (Foil) gives another 50 chips, and the Blue Joker gives another 162 chips, for a total of 417 chips. My base mult is 15. The Ride the Bus adds 33, totaling 48 additive mult. Glass adds X2, and Steel Joker adds X3.4. The total mult comes out to 326.4. Therefore, my estimated score should be around 136,108 chips, which is well above the 70,000 needed.\n\nNow, wait a second... Brainstorm *does* copy DNA's trigger! This will create another permanent copy in the deck. Not for this hand, but it's a good long-term plan. Also, the Foil on DNA is not copied by Brainstorm. The ability, not the edition, is copied.\n\nSo, I'm going to play that 10 of Hearts, in position 1. High Card. The score is estimated to be 136,109 chips. Let's do this!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1]"}
