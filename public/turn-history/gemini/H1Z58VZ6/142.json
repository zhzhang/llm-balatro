{"reasoning":"**Optimal High Card Play: Steel 5 of Hearts**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Round 13, playing a Jumbo Standard Pack. I have $30, a solid inventory of Jokers, Consumables, and Vouchers, and I'm sticking with a High Card strategy. The key here is maximizing my score by building on the existing strengths.\n\nI've got a killer setup with `Blue Joker` and its copy, `Brainstorm`, providing substantial flat chips. I also have `Ride the Bus` which is primed to scale because I'm playing High Card, and `DNA` which allows me to clone the first card played in a round, and `Steel Cards` with their multiplier which will stay in my hand for huge gains!\n\nNow, the choices. The `Steel 5 of Hearts` in choice 1 immediately jumps out. It's not a face card, so it's `Ride the Bus` friendly, and most importantly, it's a *Steel Card*. The X1.5 multiplier while in hand is *massive* for a High Card build. With `DNA`, I can clone that Steel card every single round, permanently adding it to my deck. This will stack the deck with steel cards in my hand (and in the deck), which is exactly what I want in a High Card strategy!\n\nThe `Stone Card` (+50 chips) in choice 2 is good, but that X1.5 multiplier is superior, especially with the high chip base I've already established with `Blue Joker` and `Brainstorm`. The other choices are standard cards, not worth it. The Jack in choice 5 would also reset \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nSo, I'm going with the Steel 5 of Hearts. I can clone it with `DNA`, add it to my deck, and every round, that multiplier will be sitting in my hand, boosting my score.\n\nI need to confirm the interactions of DNA and Steel Cards. Yes, DNA works on Steel cards. Perfect! It is confirmed that the Steel 5 of Hearts is the best choice here.\n\nNow, to make sure I am optimizing my Jokers, I am using Brainstorm to copy Blue Joker (+144 chips). I did the math, and even though Ride the Bus is solid, the value of those chips with this setup is significantly higher than +19 mult.\n\nFinal decision: I'm selecting the first card, the Steel 5 of Hearts.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
