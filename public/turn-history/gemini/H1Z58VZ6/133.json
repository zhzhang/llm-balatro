{"reasoning":"**Balatro: Mid-Round Analysis and Action Plan**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm deep into a run, Ante 5, and I need to generate 4,438 more chips to advance. I've got a decent hand, but I need to play this strategically. My \"Ride the Bus\" joker is active, giving me a nice mult boost, but it *cannot* be used in a round that contains a Face card. I have two discards remaining, and the key is preserving the \"Ride the Bus\" boost.\n\nI have two valuable consumables: \"The Empress\" (which could be great long-term, but it doesn't give me immediate value) and \"The Wheel of Fortune\", which has a 1 in 4 chance to upgrade a Joker. It *has* to be used now. I can't hold out to see what happens. I'm going to start with the Wheel.\n\nMy jokers are pretty good, but their order is crucial. I've got DNA (useless at this point), Brainstorm (copying the leftmost Joker), the Blue Joker (+118 chips), Mail-In Rebate (+10 mult), and \"Ride the Bus\" (+18 mult).\n\nNow, before I play anything, I *have* to rearrange my jokers. Brainstorm currently copies DNA, which is a complete waste. If I put Blue Joker in the first slot, Brainstorm will effectively give me 236 chips. If I move \"Ride the Bus\" to the first slot, Brainstorm doubles its effect, giving me a total of 36 mult! Either option will easily clear the round.\n\n*The key is, I can easily generate the chips needed, and I need to capitalize on this round.*\n\nSo, here’s the gameplan:\n\n1.  **Use \"The Wheel of Fortune\"**. I'm not targetting any particular card.\n2.  **Rearrange the Jokers**. I need to put the Blue Joker or Ride the Bus in the first position to be copied by Brainstorm.\n\nSince the goal is to win and preserve the Ride the Bus, and I have more than enough mult to make this work, the action is: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
