{"reasoning":"**Strategic Round Analysis: Turn 148**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in Round 14, facing a big blind, and need to hit 16,500 chips. My current hand looks pretty good, especially with that Gold Ace of Diamonds. The core strategy here is to use DNA to clone a valuable card and then scale up. I'm especially eager to capitalize on \"Ride the Bus\" for that juicy +19 Mult, which I'll keep in mind throughout this. \n\nFirst, I need to make the DNA-Brainstorm combo work. I'm going to leverage DNA on my first played card and want Brainstorm to copy DNA. To make that happen, I need to rearrange the Jokers. Initially, I was considering if I could copy the Blue Joker for chips, but cloning the Gold Ace is a better long-term play. I tried to find a \"Steel 5 of Hearts\" from the last round, but I can't find it in the current hand, and I don't see it in the deck. I had considered discarding to find it, but it's not worth the risk. The Gold Ace is a great alternative.\n\nAfter thinking through the best card to copy, it's clear the Gold Ace of Diamonds (position 7), which gives economy. I'm remembering that DNA only affects the *first* hand of the round, so I need to get my Jokers lined up *before* playing any cards. \n\nI've got the Jokers positioned as follows: Blue, Brainstorm, DNA, Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus. I need to make the change. I think I need the input \"rearrange_jokers\". Now, what's the correct order? Based on the schema, it's: `{\"action\": \"rearrange_jokers\", \"positions\": [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]}`\n\nI'm ready to move DNA to the 1st position with the command `{\"action\": \"rearrange_jokers\", \"positions\": [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [3,2,1,4,5]"}
