{"reasoning":"**Strategic Assessment: Ante 7, Round 23 - Shop Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Boss Blind looming, $33 in the bank. I'm in the SHOP phase, and it's time to evaluate my options. I've got a solid Joker setup: DNA (duplication), Brainstorm (copies DNA), Ride the Bus (+33 Mult), Steel Joker (scales with Steel cards), and Blue Joker (+180 Chips). My hand is a Level 15 High Card, which has been consistently scoring around 50k-70k chips in the previous rounds.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Credit Card ($1) is useless at this point. The Ceremonial Dagger ($4), while tempting, would be detrimental because it would destroy one of my high-value Jokers. I already have two consumables, The Tower and Justice, but I can't directly apply those from the shop. Reroll seems pointless with my deck build.\n\nMy primary goal is to maximize my score in this next Boss Blind and prepare for Ante 8. The shop isn't offering anything essential. I'm running a High Card strategy, and my Jokers are optimized to support it. The DNA/Brainstorm combination is key, duplicating Steel cards to maximize the Steel Joker's multiplier.\n\nThe obvious move is to proceed. I have no need to rearrange Jokers, as the current order is optimal for my strategy. The estimated chip score, based on my setup, is around 61,200, which aligns with my past performance. The only thing I can consider is selling the consumables, but their sell value is only $1. Not worth it.\n\nTherefore, the action is `round_select` - let's get on with the next round.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
