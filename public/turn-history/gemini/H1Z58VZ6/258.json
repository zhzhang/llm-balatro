{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 7/8, Round 22, in the shop phase, with $40. My current Jokers are solid: DNA, Brainstorm (for copying DNA), Steel Joker (that sweet Steel multiplier), Ride the Bus (non-face hands), and Blue Joker (chips based on deck size). I also have The Tower consumable, but it's not relevant here in the shop. The shop has Runner and Earth, neither of which are helpful for my dominant High Card strategy. My High Card level is already at 14, so I need to focus on late-game power spikes and consistency now, going into Ante 8.\n\nI've got a lot of vouchers: Hieroglyph, Blank, Director's Cut, Grabber, Paint Brush, Petroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. The shop is pretty lackluster right now, the `Earth` card is not even applicable to my deck. I've already used The High Priestess and got a Mercury planet.\n\nThe obvious question: should I reroll? I have $40, and a reroll costs $5. Given the need to adapt to Ante 7 and prepare for Ante 8, it seems prudent to look for something better. Could be Pluto, or more Steel/Stone generating Tarot cards. The Clearance Sale voucher does not apply to shop rerolls, but with $40 I can afford to reroll the shop multiple times if needed. Since I am already generating $5 in interest max, the cost is essentially free. \n\nSo, I'm going to take the action `reroll_shop`. I can see no compelling reason *not* to. The goal is simple: survive and thrive through Ante 7, and prepare for what's next. Let's see what comes up.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
