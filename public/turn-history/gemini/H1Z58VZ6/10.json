{"reasoning":"**Boss Blind Strategy - Ante 1**\n\nOkay, here we are, staring down the Boss Blind of Ante 1 in Balatro. Five bucks in the bank, and a cool 600 chips to hit. The Goad is in effect, which means spades are debuffed, but I'm not too concerned. I've got my Mail-In Rebate Joker (Holographic, nice!), which should be providing a solid +10 Multiplier.\n\nLet's see… The Joker's rank is King, which should be the case for this round based on its description \"rank changes every round\". I am wondering if the game updates the rank immediately when it is purchased, or at the start of a round, and if so, when it will be updated to a different rank, but for now it's a King and I'll keep that in mind.\n\nWith that Holographic Mult, even a weak hand should be enough to hit the target. Even a High Card with a non-spade would bring in 165 chips. A Pair would be more than enough with 360. 600 chips? Piece of cake.\n\nI've got no consumables to worry about, and only one Joker, so the only real action here is to just `play_round`. Easy win, let's get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
