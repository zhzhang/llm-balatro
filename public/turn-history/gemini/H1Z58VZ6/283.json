{"reasoning":"**Endgame Analysis: Round 24 - The Final Push**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm staring down the final boss of Ante 8. The shop's up, I've got $12, and my Joker setup is pretty solid: DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, and Blue Joker. My hand is High Card at level 16, which is already a high-scoring hand.\n\nThe shop is offering Earth (useless for me) and Crafty Joker (also useless). A reroll costs $8. I have The Tower consumable, but it is not useful at the current time.\n\nI have $12, which means I earn $2 interest. I need to maximize my score to win this, but is it worth risking the $8? After a reroll I'd only have $4 left. I could potentially get a Planet card, like Pluto, but maybe not.\n\nThe current Jokers are set up perfectly: Brainstorm is copying DNA, which will allow for a doubled card on the first hand for scaling. Ride the Bus and Steel Joker give me scaling multipliers, and Blue Joker pumps up my chips. I'm already hitting about 90k chips per High Card.\n\nRerolling is tempting for a shot at a celestial pack, but it's a gamble. At this point, the reroll risk outweighs the potential reward. There's a decent chance I won't even be able to afford the card I find. This strategy is also more likely to be successful.\n\nI've got to check my Joker order once more. Yup, DNA (1) is leftmost, and Brainstorm (2) is copying it. That's the correct setup for the beginning of the next round. I don't need to use *The Tower* consumable right now. It's safe to keep in my inventory.\n\nThe plan is to keep my money, earn interest, and head into the next round with my current powerhouse setup. I'm choosing `round_select` and moving forward.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
