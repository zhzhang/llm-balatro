{"reasoning":"**My Strategy for This Round**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I'm in Ante 5, Round 13, and staring at a small blind. I'm short about 4,438 chips, with three hands left to play. Got to thin this deck and get back on top. My primary objective is to win this round, while optimizing the deck for future rounds, and also use those consumables.\n\nI have The Hanged Man, which destroys cards, and The Emperor, which creates Tarot cards. I also have some useful Jokers. Before I do anything, it looks like my previous action was discarding two 10D Wild cards to generate Tarot cards.\n\nNow, my initial thought is to play a high-value hand, using a Stone Card for its bonus chips. I'm thinking a simple High Card strategy to start. So let's maximize my hand value. I have to make a choice. If I use Blue Joker and Ride the Bus with the Stone Card, I will win. I should be able to get at least 12,000 chips. And if I do that, the round is won.\n\nI see that DNA is currently being copied by Brainstorm, but DNA only triggers on the first hand. Brainstorm is useless right now, so it's a good time to adjust those Jokers. I can maximize value. My intuition says to move Blue Joker to the top to get the chip boost from Brainstorm, and also the bonus multiplier from Ride the Bus.\n\nNow, how do I actually *get* that value? I have two consumables: Emperor and Hanged Man. I need to thin my deck, get rid of those weak cards, 2C and 6C. The Hanged Man is perfect for that. I should use The Hanged Man first. I can free up a slot, and then use The Emperor, to generate some random Tarot cards.\n\nWait, should I rearrange Jokers *before* I use the consumable? Nah, I don't think it matters. The Hanged Man doesn't care about the Jokers. So, the Hanged Man gets used first.\n\nI check my hand: the 6C is at position 2, and the 2C is at position 3. The Hanged Man is at position 2. So the command should be to use the consumable at position 2 and target cards at positions 2 and 3.\n\nI'm double-checking the chip calculations... I can win this round even without optimizing the Jokers, but I want to make sure I am playing optimally. Even a simple Stone Card with my current setup should be enough to win. But I have to give the instructions for *this* action.\n\nOkay, so I will now use Hanged Man.\nAction: `use_consumable 2 2 3` and that should win the round.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,2,3]"}
