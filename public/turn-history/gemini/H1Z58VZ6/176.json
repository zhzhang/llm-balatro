{"reasoning":"**Current Blind Selection Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Round 16 of Ante 5, staring down the Big Blind of 16,500 chips. The immediate concern is The Needle, the upcoming Boss Blind that limits me to one hand, needing 11,000 to clear. I have $46 and can make roughly $10-12 if I play. I also have an option to skip, taking a free Uncommon Joker, but I don't think that's the play here.\n\nLet's break down the hand: I have a solid setup. I'm rocking Ride the Bus and Brainstorm, effectively doubling the bonus for non-face cards, which is +24 Mult. Then I have Blue Joker for +154 chips, DNA (Foil) for +50 chips and copying a card into the deck, and Steel Joker which is a x2 multiplier. My plan is to lean on a High Card - Level 8 (8 mult, 75 chips) for a High Card hand. My last hand was a High Card for 30,366 chips.\n\nThe math looks promising. My base High Card gets me around 280 chips. Then, with the mults, I'm looking at 8 (base) + 24 (Ride the Bus) + 24 (Brainstorm) = 56. With Steel Joker, that gets doubled to 112 mult. That means I'm looking at 280 chips * 112 = approximately 31,360 chips. That's way over the 16,500 target for this blind and easily crushes the 11,000 The Needle blind, which is perfect.\n\nSkipping gets me a free Uncommon Joker, but I lose money and the chance to scale \"Ride the Bus\" and DNA. Playing is almost always better in Balatro unless I'm in serious trouble, or the Tag is a bomb. Scaling Ride the Bus and DNA are too good to pass up.\n\nBefore I commit, I need to check the Joker order is optimal. Ride the Bus (+24), Brainstorm (+24), Blue Joker (+154), DNA (+50), and Steel Joker (x2) – that seems correct for additive mult, then multiplicative. Brainstorm should be copying the highest Mult, so that is Ride the Bus.\n\n\"The Moon\" is still in inventory, but I don't need it right now.\n\nI think I'm good. Double-checking, The Needle lets me play one hand, and my estimate hits 31,000 chips. I don't need to reroll this boss. I'm confident, I'm going to play this blind, scale Ride the Bus, get some money, and trigger DNA again.\n\nAlright, the command is `play_round`. No need for positions, intended hand type, or estimated chips, that's all built-in. I'll get that DNA trigger and get paid.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play_round\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\nThat checks out. Let's play.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
