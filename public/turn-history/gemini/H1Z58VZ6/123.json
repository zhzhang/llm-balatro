{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 5/8, Round 12, in the SHOP phase. I've got $33, which is more than enough to worry about the interest cap. I've got a decent Joker setup: DNA, Brainstorm (copying DNA), Blue Joker (chipping in), Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. I'm running a High Card strategy and I'm looking to maximize that. I also have some useful vouchers: Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale.\n\nThe shop is showing me Crazy Joker (Straights) and Clever Joker (Two Pair), which are completely useless to me. I've already bought my Standard Pack, so boosters are off the table.\n\nNow, with $33, the reroll cost is $5. I can definitely afford to reroll the shop once and still stay above the $25 interest threshold. Telescope is owned, so that means Celestial Packs are very high priority, particularly for leveling up my High Card strategy, and I am keen to get Pluto.\n\nSo, I'm going to take a moment here. Should I buy either of the current cards? No, they don't help. Should I proceed to the next round? I could, but it would be a wasted opportunity to leverage this cash. One reroll is a wise move. I'll still have $28, which is above the interest cap.\n\nMy High Card level is already at 6, so I know I am scaling well. Finding Pluto through the Telescope is the most efficient way to maximize my current build. So, I am definitely going to reroll.\n\n**Decision:** I'm going to run the command `reroll_shop`. The reasoning is straightforward: I have more than enough cash ($33), the current shop cards are a dead loss for my strategy, and a single reroll gives me a shot at Pluto or some useful Tarots or Jokers.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
