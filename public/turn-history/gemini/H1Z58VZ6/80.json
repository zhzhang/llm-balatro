{"reasoning":"**Initial Assessment and Planning**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4, Round 9. I've got $28, and my Joker setup is DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. I've got the Death consumable. Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. Hand Leveling is on High Card, Level 4. I played High Card last round.\n\nThe shop has \"To Do List\" (foil, +50 chips), Saturn (upgrade Straight), a Standard Pack, a Jumbo Celestial Pack, and the Grabber voucher (+1 hand). I'm running a DNA/Brainstorm build, using Blue Joker for chips, and Mail-In Rebate/Ride the Bus for mult.\n\nMy strategy right now centers on duplicating cards with DNA and Brainstorm, leveraging Ride the Bus and Mail-In Rebate for mult, and Blue Joker for chips. High Card is my main hand.\n\nThe Grabber voucher is very tempting. It's only $7, which will get me back the hand I lost from Hieroglyph. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is interesting, especially since I have the Telescope voucher which *guarantees* a planet for my most played hand (High Card!). Buying the celestial pack means I could find Pluto, which would level up my High Card. Saturn upgrades Straight (not useful for me). To Do List is a possible chip generator, but I'm content with my Blue Joker for now. The standard pack provides a chance to find cards that are duplicatable by DNA.\n\nGiven the options, buying the Grabber voucher is the most logical first step. It is the most valuable and costs the least amount, at $7. It's a permanent buff and provides more flexibility for my existing strategy, by giving an extra hand. Buying it doesn't prevent me from buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack later, and the Telescope ensures I get the Pluto planet (for High Card leveling).\n\nTherefore, my immediate plan is to execute this:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_voucher\",\n  \"positions\": [\n    1\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
