{"reasoning":"**The Needle's Eye: A High Card Gamble**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 5, Round 17. Shop phase. I've got $34, which is enough for a couple of rerolls, but I'm entering The Needle, the Boss Blind where only a *single* hand counts. My initial thought is that the available cards, `The World` and `Faceless Joker`, are utterly useless for my High Card/Steel Joker strategy. `The World` converts cards to Spades, but my build is suit-agnostic. `Faceless Joker` wants me to discard face cards, which I'm actively avoiding because of `Ride the Bus`. And my Joker inventory is full.\n\nThe pressure is on. I need to max out this single hand for a huge score. My High Card level is already at 9, and based on previous runs, I'm hovering around 31,000 for High Card (though I've seen it hit nearly 50,000 in higher stakes). The Needle usually demands 50,000 to 60,000, but I need to quickly calculate my power level. I'm focusing on either Pluto (for High Card), Steel cards (for my Steel Joker), or a more effective joker that can replace `Ride the Bus` or the `Blue Joker`.\n\nI need to make a decision here. Rerolling once to see if a better card appears would be a good play, and I can afford it.\n\nSo, let's say I reroll. It'll cost me $8, leaving me with $26. My next reroll will be $9.\n\nNow, considering The Needle, with only *one* hand, I've got to fine-tune my Jokers. `DNA` is currently the leftmost Joker, and `Brainstorm` is copying it. That's good for general deck strength, but not what I need here. DNA-ing a Steel card is perfect for building the deck, but not in The Needle. I should rearrange it to copy `Steel Joker` or `Ride the Bus`. `Steel Joker` says \"X0.2 Mult for each Steel Card in your full deck\". So, if `Brainstorm` copies it, that effect is doubled! `Ride the Bus` is +25 Mult, and `Blue Joker` gives +158 chips.\n\nLet's estimate my current hand's scoring:\n\n*   **Base:** 85 chips, 9 Mult (High Card lvl 9).\n*   **Jokers:**\n    *   `DNA`: +50 chips.\n    *   `Brainstorm` (copying DNA): +0 chips.\n    *   `Ride the Bus`: +25 Mult.\n    *   `Blue Joker`: +158 chips.\n    *   `Steel Joker`: X2 Mult.\n    *   Let's assume two Steel Cards in hand: X1.5 * X1.5 = X2.25\n\n    **Calculation:**\n    Chips: 85 (base) + 158 (Blue) + 50 (DNA Foil) = ~300.\n    Mult: 9 (base) + 25 (Bus) = 34.\n    Steel Joker: X2.\n    Steel Cards (in hand): X1.5 * X1.5 = X2.25.\n    Total: 300 \\* 34 \\* 2 \\* 2.25 = 45,900.\n    I'm barely short of the 50,000 requirement.\n\n    If `Brainstorm` copies `Steel Joker`:\n    Mult: 34.\n    Steel Joker: X2.\n    Brainstorm (copying Steel Joker): X2.\n    Steel Cards: X2.25.\n    Total: 300 \\* 34 \\* 2 \\* 2 \\* 2.25 = 91,800.\n    That's *much* safer.\n\nSince I have the funds and I'm in the Shop, I'm going to take one more reroll to hopefully find an item I can actually use. Afterwards, I'll *immediately* rearrange my Jokers, and prepare for The Needle. The cards available in the shop are useless. Reroll!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
