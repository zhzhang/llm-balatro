{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State: Play the Round**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 21. Blind Select phase, Small Blind is up for 35,000 chips. I'm currently the small blind, sitting on $35. My standard skip tag is active (Mega Standard Pack). Let's break this down.\n\nMy setup is interesting. I have a High Card engine that I'm trying to develop, and it involves DNA and Brainstorm (both foil) copying cards, with Steel Joker as my primary scaling joker. Right now, DNA's in slot 1, Brainstorm's in slot 2, Steel Joker's in slot 3, Ride the Bus in 4, and Blue Joker in 5. I also have The Tower consumable, and a decent voucher selection: Hieroglyph, Blank, Director's Cut, Grabber, Paint Brush, Petroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale.\n\nMy hand levels are High Card Level 13 (125 chips, 13 mult). So here's the play: I'm currently running a High Card strategy. The goal is to get my Steel Joker to scale up.\n\nIf I play this round, and the first hand I play is one card, DNA in slot 1 and Brainstorm in slot 2 will trigger. DNA creates a permanent copy of the card I play, and Brainstorm then *copies* the *DNA*. This is a crucial early setup, it means I am duplicating the card I play twice, and drawing the copies into my hand. If I can get this to scale a Steel card, I am making good progress.\n\nSkipping and taking a Mega Standard Pack seems okay, but there's a much better play. If I play this round, I can:\n\n1.  Duplicate a high-value card (ideally a Steel card) twice through DNA and Brainstorm.\n2.  Win the round for $3, plus interest on my money, plus any money left over in the remaining hands\n3.  Enter the shop phase. Here, I can use my Telescope to find Pluto (High Card) cards, or just look for more scaling options.\n\nThe Small Blind is 35,000 chips. My High Card scoring, even at this stage, reliably lands between 20k and 30k. With two hands, I'll *easily* clear the small blind.\n\nThe real kicker? Playing this round is significantly better for my DNA engine. Every round I play is 2 more Steel cards in the deck (+X0.4 mult to Steel Joker).\n\nSo here’s what I'll do: I’ll play the Small Blind to build up my Steel Joker's multiplier. This gets my engine going and allows me to scale up and get some extra cash. The plan after the first hand is to move Brainstorm to copy either Steel Joker for the multiplier, Blue Joker for the chips, or Ride the Bus for some additive mult. I am currently in a solid spot to beat the blind with the current order, which is optimal for the *first* hand of the round.\n\nAction: `play_round`.\nPositions: null\nIntended hand type: null\nEstimated chips: null\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
