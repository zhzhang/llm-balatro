{"reasoning":"**Strategic Ante 8 Musings**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 8, aiming for the Big Blind (75k) and the Crimson Heart Boss Blind (100k). I'm sitting on $16. Let's break down the hand and formulate a plan.\n\nMy Jokers are a solid mix: DNA (foil, +50 chips), Brainstorm (holo, +10 mult, copying DNA), Ride the Bus (+35 mult), Steel Joker (x3.8 mult), and Blue Joker (+190 chips). I have \"The Tower\" consumable and Vouchers for Telescope (Pluto!), Planet Merchant, and Director's Cut (reroll boss). The shop's got Baron ($6), Juggler ($3), and an Arcana Pack ($3).\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune hit on Brainstorm, which is huge – a holographic +10 mult boost is always welcome. My primary concern is the Crimson Heart boss, which disables a Joker each hand. With Brainstorm potentially copying Steel Joker (if I rearrange), the scoring ceiling is massive. But losing Steel Joker or Brainstorm in that equation is a serious blow. Ride the Bus and Blue Joker provide a nice, safe floor.\n\nI need to survive this Ante, so let's focus on the Big Blind first. The Baron card looks tempting because of my 5 Kings, but Blue Joker’s +190 chips is too valuable to swap for only a multiplier. High Card level 16 is 155 chips, so Blue Joker is clearly the better play.\n\nThe Arcana Pack is only $3, and I've got $16. I can afford it, and potentially reroll the Boss for $10 if the situation looks dire.\n\n*   First, I should see if the Arcana Pack nets me a Steel card. I've got \"The Tower\" in my back pocket. I can also reroll the boss if needed.\n*   I can sell Blue Joker for Baron, but chips are key. Not going to take this risk at the moment.\n\nThe immediate move is to buy the Arcana Pack. That's the priority right now.\n\n*   Action: `buy_booster`, position: 1.\n*   Remaining Money: $13. I'm safe.\n*   I should stick to the plan of buying packs first, then boss reroll, if needed.\n\nThe boss, Crimson Heart, is manageable, I have enough padding. But rerolling is always the safer play. Let's check the Buy Card options after.\n\n*   Now I should check the Joker setup.\n*   I need DNA in the leftmost position for Brainstorm to copy it.\n*   So I rearrange Brainstorm to copy Steel Joker for the scoring hands and keep them as DNA (1) and Brainstorm (2) for this round.\n\nArcana Pack purchase is the move, now!\n*   Shop items: Baron ($6), Juggler ($3), Arcana Pack ($3).\n*   Decision: Buy Booster 1 (Arcana Pack).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
