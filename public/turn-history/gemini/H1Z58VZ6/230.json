{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Play: A Calculated Risk**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: big blind of 30,000, currently at 19,947, and only three hands left to clear it. I'm sitting on a solid hand – a High Card with a Stone Card, which should be the core of this play. I have to get over the blind.\n\nThe Jokers are where the real power is. I've got DNA, Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker. DNA, as a first-hand effect, is already out of the picture for this round but will be good in the next. Brainstorm is currently copying DNA. The Steel Joker is critical; that 2.2x multiplier and the Steel King card in hand is going to be significant. Ride the Bus is already at a good +28 multiplier, which is scaling really nicely with the non-face cards. Blue Joker helps with raw chips. I also have \"The Tower\" and \"The High Priestess\" consumables.\n\nI'm initially considering playing the Stone Card from position 9 and making it a high card, which seems the most straightforward. The initial plan is to leverage the Stone Card (base 95 chips, +50 from Stone Card, +132 from Blue Joker), a solid base plus the multiplier from Ride the Bus and the Steel Joker and the X1.5 from the Steel King. But my goal is to avoid face cards to keep Ride the Bus scaling.\n\nSo, for this turn, I had an estimate of ~34000 for this hand. However, the last hand was scored at 19947, even though the calculation was closer to ~34k. The difference might be due to a bug, I will play safe.\n\nBased on the cards, I'll go with the Stone Card from position 10. This feels like the safest bet to get a solid score. I am going to play the Stone Card. I do not have to move the Jokers or use any consumables to win the round.\n\nGiven I've crunched the numbers, the choice is clear and the JSON will reflect this. Play card 10 as a high card.\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [10]"}
