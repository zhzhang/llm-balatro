{"reasoning":"**Strategic Card Selection: Prioritizing Blue Seals for High Card Scaling**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 8, Round 26. I'm in the Mega Standard Pack phase, and my goal remains the same: optimize for High Card. My Joker lineup is solid: DNA, Brainstorm (copying DNA), Ride the Bus (mult for face-less hands), Steel Joker (X-mult for steel cards), and Blue Joker (chips for cards). I also have a Tower consumable.\n\nThe crucial element here is the Blue Seal cards and their ability to generate Pluto cards for the High Card hand. My current money is decent, $34, so immediate monetary gains are less critical than long-term scaling.\n\nLooking at the remaining cards, the options are: a 2 of Spades (Gold), a 4 of Diamonds (Blue Seal), a 3 of Hearts (Mult), and a 9 of Hearts (Blue Seal). My strategy points me directly toward the Blue Seals, specifically the 9 of Hearts.\n\nThe 9 of Hearts is the best choice because it gives me a higher base card value to work with when creating Pluto cards. I'm trying to max out the number of Pluto cards I can hold in my hand. The other options are less impactful: the gold card is okay, but I prefer the scaling of the Blue Seal for my strategy, and the mult card is not super helpful when I'm focused on High Card.\n\nThe prompt is also reminding me that the selection order matters, so I need to select the 9 of Hearts, which is currently in position 4. So the action will be `select 4`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
