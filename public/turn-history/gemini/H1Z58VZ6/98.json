{"reasoning":"**A Tactical Assessment: Prioritizing Tarot Potential**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm staring down Round 11 of this Balatro game, big blind's hitting, and I need to bank 2657 more chips to stay in the game. I’ve got some strong jokers out: a Blue Joker for chip generation, Mail-in Rebate adding mult, Ride the Bus, already stacking mult for non-face cards, and DNA & Brainstorm, which, honestly, are less helpful now that the round has started.\n\nI'm holding three 10 of Diamonds, which are Wild and can create Tarots when discarded. That's the key. I have the Chariot consumable, which will create a Steel card.  I need to figure out the optimal order.\n\nMy initial thought was to use the Chariot on a card, probably the King of Hearts, for that sweet 1.5x multiplier.  But wait – the primary goal this turn is to get the Tarot card generated. I have two consumables slots. I'll get a Tarot, and can still get the Steel King.\n\nSo, here's the plan. My primary move: I will discard the 10 of Diamonds to get a tarot, then I will use the Chariot to make the King of Hearts a Steel card, and *then* play a non-face card to finish the round. It's the most efficient way to get more options for the future.\n\nThe JSON will look like this, per the specifications: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [1, 4]}`.\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,4]"}
