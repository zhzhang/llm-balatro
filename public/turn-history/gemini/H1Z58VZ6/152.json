{"reasoning":"**Current Decision: Choosing a Planet**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking for this round. I'm at Ante 5/8, Round 14, in the shop phase, specifically the PLANET\\_PACK step. I have $38 and a solid set of Jokers: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm (which copies Ride the Bus), Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and DNA. I also have The Empress and The Moon as consumables, and Vouchers like Telescope and Clearance Sale.\n\nMy established strategy is High Card at Level 6, and I need to select a planet from the Jumbo Celestial Pack. The next boss, \"The Arm,\" is a hand-level-reducer, so I need to maintain scoring potential.\n\nMy options are Pluto, Venus, Earth, Uranus, and Mars. Thanks to Telescope, Pluto is guaranteed to be in the pack, and that's the obvious choice. I'm focusing on High Card, and leveling it further will help counter the boss's effect. Ride the Bus and Brainstorm provide a huge mult bonus as long as I don't play face cards, so High Card is the safest way to exploit that synergy. Therefore, Pluto is the right move.\n\nNow, I'm going to formulate the command. I need to select Pluto, which is at position 1 in the pack. The action is `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1]}`. Now I must ensure this is a valid JSON object: properly formatted with double quotes, a single JSON object, and no extra text or comments. I'm ready to proceed.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
