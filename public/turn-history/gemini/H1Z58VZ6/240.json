{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current Round and Planning for Maximum Value**\n\nOkay, here we go. Ante 6, Round 21. Boss blind is the Manacle, which is annoying, but manageable – losing a hand size isn't the end of the world. Need 40,000 chips. Got $39.\n\nMy hand: Ace of Spades, 9 of Spades, 6 of Spades (with $3 held), two 10 of Diamonds, and the all-important 4 of Diamonds (Steel).  Also have a Stone Card in hand.\n\nMy Jokers are: DNA (foil), Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker. DNA copies the leftmost joker, and Brainstorm copies DNA. Steel Joker gives that sweet x2.2 Mult, Ride the Bus gives Mult based on non-face cards, and Blue Joker is a straight chip boost (+148, which also scales with remaining cards: +2 for each remaining card in the deck). The Tower is in my consumables, which can enhance a card to a Stone Card.\n\nThe key here is DNA/Brainstorm and the Steel Card synergy. I want to duplicate that Steel 4 of Diamonds.  Ride the Bus is another key.  My current High Card level is 12, giving me 115 chips and 12 mult. That's a good foundation.\n\nI've got to play exactly one card to trigger DNA/Brainstorm.  The 4 of Diamonds (position 6) is the play. It's not a face card, so Ride the Bus won't be ruined. This should be pretty straightforward. The Steel Joker is going to love those copies.\n\nLet's break down the score: I play the 4 of Diamonds. I expect DNA and Brainstorm to create two additional Steel 4s. The Blue Joker, DNA, and High Card will add a ton of chips. I know this should be around the ~28,000 range.\n\nI just need to figure out how to arrange and play the cards, specifically how the held Steel Card affects the calculation. The Steel Joker gives x2.2 mult. Playing the 4 will make x1.5 \"held in hand\" go away, but it's okay because of DNA and Brainstorm. The Steel Joker scales this turn, as well as the next.\n\nI've got the math down. 317 chips with 90 mult. Nope, the Ride the Bus is going to give me +30 Mult, so the math is: 317 * (12 + 29 (Ride the Bus) + 1 (Ride the Bus on the 4 of Diamonds) ) * 2.2 = ~29,000. Not enough to win, but I'll set up DNA.\n\nShould I use The Tower? No, not yet. I have no face cards, and I need to save it for when I have face cards to protect Ride the Bus.\n\nThe cards in the hand also have the potential to make Tarot cards when discarded! I'll come back to this. DNA first.\n\nDeck check! 74 cards, my High Card is Level 12, and I have 19 tens. This is perfect for DNA. No reasons to rearrange: DNA, Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker.\n\nLet's do this. I'm playing the Steel 4 of Diamonds (position 6) as a High Card.\nEstimated: 28,500.\n\nLet's execute!\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [6]"}
