{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Standard Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 23. The goal is clear: snag the best card from this Standard Pack to boost the deck and score. I've got $33 in the bank, and my inventory is looking solid: DNA (duplication!), Brainstorm (copying DNA), Ride the Bus (+33 Mult if no face cards), Steel Joker (scaling Mult), Blue Joker (chip boost based on remaining deck cards), and a couple of consumables, The Tower (Stone) and Justice (Glass).\n\nMy current strategy is built around a High Card, aiming to duplicate non-face cards – especially those lovely Steel cards – using DNA and Brainstorm to juice up that Steel Joker. Right now, it gives me X3.2 Mult.\n\nLet's look at the options. We've got a 7 of Clubs (meh), a 10 of Diamonds (Steel), and a King of Diamonds (Lucky, Red Seal).\n\nThe 7 of Clubs is uninspiring. It marginally boosts the Blue Joker, but that's about it. The King of Diamonds is tempting with that Red Seal retrigger and potential for big multipliers, but it's a face card, so that would kill my \"Ride the Bus\" streak, and I don't love relying on RNG.\n\nHowever, the 10 of Diamonds is where it's at. This is a Steel card, so it's a perfect fit. I currently have enough steel cards in the deck to trigger a mult of X3.2. Adding this will increase it to X3.4. And it offers a 1.5x Mult in hand! If I get this in my first hand, DNA and Brainstorm can make two more per round. That is significant scaling for the Steel Joker. Plus, it's not a face card, so I can keep that \"Ride the Bus\" multiplier rolling.\n\nSo, the optimal choice is the Steel 10 of Diamonds. That's the one. Let's make it happen. I'll \"select\" position 2. I have to put this in the correct schema, though...Action: \"select\", Positions: \\[2]. `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [2], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`. Perfect. Let's grab this card!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
