{"reasoning":"**Ante 8, Shop Time: Prioritizing the Final Push**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 8, Round 25, Shop phase. Got $20 in the bank. My hand is a High Card build. My Joker setup is looking solid: DNA (foil, adding card copies, critical for Steel scaling), Brainstorm (essential to copy DNA/Steel), Ride the Bus (+35 Mult), Steel Joker (x3.8 Mult - the engine!), and Blue Joker (+190 Chips). I've also got The Tower consumable and a bunch of vouchers.\n\nBoss coming up is The Crimson Heart, which is bad news because it disables a random joker each hand. My target for the Big Blind is 75k, and the Boss Blind is 100k. I cleared the Small Blind easily with 91k. I need to be able to hit 100k even with a Joker disabled. If Steel Joker is disabled, I'm toast (losing a massive multiplier source). Need to adjust my strategy.\n\nI'm looking at the shop: Baron ($6), Juggler ($3), Jumbo Arcana Pack ($4), and Arcana Pack ($3). Director's Cut ($10) to reroll the boss is an option.\n\nBaron could be good because I have 5 Kings in my deck, and it gives me x1.5 Multi per King. But I need to weigh the value of that compared to Blue Joker's flat chips or Ride the Bus's constant mult. I'm focusing on the Steel Joker and DNA synergy. My initial thought is that Baron isn't quite worth it.\n\nJuggler is okay, but I don't think it's worth it for a Joker slot at this point.\n\nJumbo Arcana Pack and Arcana Pack are interesting because they *could* provide Steel cards (big win for scaling), or other useful effects to help me get to the target. I've also got the Telescope which should give me Pluto if I get the right pack.\n\nRerolling the boss is tempting, but that eats into my funds. I've only got $20. I could reroll ($10), and then I'd have $10 left. That's not ideal. But maybe I need to do it to increase my odds of winning.\n\nI'm worried about \"The Crimson Heart.\" If Steel Joker gets disabled, my score plummets. I need to make sure I can still reach 100k even with one Joker gone. I ran the numbers. Nope. With Steel Joker disabled, I *fail* to hit the required chip target.\n\nSo, I MUST reroll the boss, or improve my build to get consistent scoring. My goal is to get more Steel cards or Pluto via Celestial packs. Since I'm on High Card, I want to use the Telescope to find Pluto.\n\nI need to buy the Jumbo Arcana pack to find more Steel cards.\n\nMoney check: $20. I can reroll the boss for $10 and I can afford the Jumbo Arcana ($4). That will give me $6 left over. I can buy both Jumbo Arcana ($4) and Arcana ($3) packs, and have enough to reroll the boss and have $3 left. That seems pretty safe to me.\n\nI'm re-thinking Baron again. My deck does have 5 Kings... If I sell Blue Joker (+190) for Baron, I could get an xMult for every King in hand. With 5 Kings, I could get a nice boost if I have 1 or 2 in hand. But, Blue Joker is consistent. For my High Card build, I'm better off keeping the chip source.\n\nOkay, let's see, what about my Joker order? DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, Blue Joker. Brainstorm copies DNA at the start of the *next* round. Then it will copy Steel Joker. Wait, if I shift Brainstorm so it copies Steel Joker, my score will jump!\n\nChips: ~400.\nMult: 51 * 3.8 * 3.8 = 736.\nScore: 400 * 736 = 294,400.\nI'm easily clearing the boss!\n\nI need to secure the shop *first* before I make any moves. Buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack is a good move to get potential Steel cards.\n\nThe prompt is making me self-check again: I only return a single object, and the schema is a JSON object.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n\n1.  Buy Jumbo Arcana Pack ($4).\n2.  Reroll the Boss.\n\nThis is the correct action to improve\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
