{"reasoning":"**Pack Analysis and Strategy for Ante 8**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante 8, Mega Standard Pack, two selections to make. My inventory gives me some solid options: a Foil DNA Joker (perfect for deck manipulation), Brainstorm (Holo), Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, and Blue Joker. The Tower consumable is also ready to go. Currently have $34.\n\nMy High Card strategy is Level 16 with 16x multiplier – this is the cornerstone of my current build. Time to scale this further.\n\nThe choices in the Mega Standard Pack are: a Gold 2 of Spades (good for money, but not as good for scaling in Ante 8), a Blue Seal 4 of Diamonds (creates the planet of the final hand if held), a Mult enhancement 3 of Hearts (decent but ultimately weak), another Blue Seal, a 9 of Hearts, and, best of all, a Blue Seal Stone Card.\n\nRide the Bus provides mult for hands without face cards, so anything that fits that criteria is perfect. The Steel Joker isn't immediately useful (no Steel cards present, though I can transform later), and the Blue Joker chips are dependent on deck size. DNA can copy the first card I play, so is a game changer.\n\nGiven my High Card focus and the value of leveling that further, the Stone Card with the Blue Seal is the clear first pick. The +50 chips on the Stone Card itself is a bonus, and it won't break \"Ride the Bus.\" That Blue Seal generates \"Pluto\", which I'm relying on for my High Card progression.\n\nThe 9 of Hearts with a Blue Seal is also a decent choice, though not as strong as the Stone Card. The 4 of Diamonds (Blue Seal) isn't as good as the 9 of Hearts. The Gold 2 of Spades provides a bit more cash. The 3 of Hearts is additive multiplier, which is weak compared to level scaling or X-mult.\n\nThe pack requires two selections. I'll take the Stone Card (Position 5) first. For the second selection, I want another Blue Seal card to maximize the chance of drawing one at the end of a round. 9 of Hearts (Choice 4) is better than 4 of Diamonds (Choice 2) for the +9 chips > +4 chips. However, I should check whether there is value to copying it. DNA copies all properties of the card.\n\nWait, I can only pick one card at a time. Okay, Step 1: Select Choice 5 (Stone Card [Blue Seal]).\n\nThe Stone Card is excellent: Blue Seal *and* +50 chips base, no face card, and is the correct hand type for my game plan. Let's make sure I enter this command correctly: `select 5`.\n\nReasoning recap: Blue Seal generates Pluto, which is key. The Stone Card is superior due to +50 chips. It's a High Card play, so I will play this on first hand to make best use of DNA.\n\nFinal Action: `select 5`.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
