{"reasoning":"**High Card Optimization in the Celestial Arena**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. Ante 6/8, and I'm transitioning from the shop phase into the Planet Pack phase. Just splurged on that Jumbo Celestial Pack, and my bankroll is sitting at $47. The goal, as always, is to sculpt a beastly High Card build, focusing on scaling Steel Joker and deftly dodging those pesky face cards to dominate Ride the Bus. My most frequent hand by far has been High Card, played 28 times, so I've got a strong foundation. The Telescope voucher is doing its work to ensure I'm getting planets that directly support my high card strategy, this round the Telescope is working to get a Pluto in the pack.\n\nLooking at the pack choices, here's my assessment:\n\n1.  **Pluto:** This is the obvious first choice. It will level up my High Card hand. It's the lynchpin, and given my level 10 high card, it's the clear path forward.\n2.  Mars: While Four of a Kind is nice, it doesn't align with this build.\n3.  Venus: Three of a Kind is useless here.\n4.  Mercury: The pair does not match my build.\n5.  Jupiter: Flush is a hard pass.\n\nGiven my strategic aim, the Telescope is doing the work to put Pluto in the pack, so I'm moving forward with that choice.\n\nTherefore, the action is to \"select\" option 1, which should be Pluto. No need to worry about any estimated chips in this phase, it's all about hand development.\n\nTime to execute. `select 1`!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
