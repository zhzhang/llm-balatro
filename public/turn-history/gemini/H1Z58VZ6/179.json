{"reasoning":"**Analysis of Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. We're in Ante 5/8, Round 17. The game state is PLANET\\_PACK, and I've got $57 in the bank. My Joker lineup is looking pretty solid: Ride the Bus (+25 Mult), Brainstorm (copying Ride the Bus, so another +25), Blue Joker (+156 Chips), DNA (Foil, +50 Chips), and Steel Joker (X2 Mult). My current hand is a Level 8 High Card, with 75 Base Chips and 8 Base Mult. The Telescope Voucher guarantees Pluto in the Celestial Packs, which is crucial, especially considering my strategy of sticking to a High Card build.\n\nLooking at the selections, I've got Pluto, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Neptune. Pluto is the obvious choice. The voucher locks it in, and leveling up Pluto will boost my High Card to level 9, adding +10 chips and +1 mult. I'm intentionally ignoring the other options as they focus on Straight, Flush, Four of a Kind, and Straight Flush, which aren't part of my intended strategy.\n\nCurrently, my High Card is at 75 Chips and 8 Mult. After upgrading Pluto, this will be 85 Chips and 9 Mult. Now, considering the Joker effects: Ride the Bus and Brainstorm combined add +50 Mult, the Blue Joker provides +156 Chips, and the DNA card adds +50 Chips. Steel Joker will double the total Mult.\n\nLet's do the math. The final Mult will be (9 + 25 + 25) * 2 = 59 * 2 = 118 Mult. The final Chips will be 85 (base) + 156 (Blue) + 50 (DNA) + approx 10 card value = 301 Chips. This yields an expected score of 301 * 118 = 35,518.\n\nI need 11,000 for The Needle. The estimated score is well above this requirement.\n\nSo, the action is `select`, and the position is `[1]` – that's Pluto. The `select` command is the correct one for choosing a planet card, and the position is 1-indexed. The schema should be: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1], \"intended_hand_type\": \"high card\", \"estimated_chips\": 35518}`. That should do it!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
