{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Ante 8, Round 26. Shop phase. I've got $34. Let's see... Jokers are set: DNA (Foil), Brainstorm (Holo), Ride the Bus (+36 Mult, no face cards needed), Steel Joker (X4.2, meaning 16 Steel cards), and Blue Joker (+198 Chips). I have The Tower consumable in inventory, and my High Card hand is at level 16. Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Paint Brush, Clearance Sale, Blank, Petroglyph, Telescope, Planet Merchant.\n\nThe shop itself has a Splash Joker ($2), The Devil consumable ($2), and a Standard Pack ($3). I need to maximize the scoring for my High Card. Steel cards are key to boosting Steel Joker, and Pluto planets help level up the High Card. I already have two copies per round with the DNA and Brainstorm setup.\n\nThe plan is to leverage the Steel Joker's scaling. The Standard Pack is cheap, and it could provide a Steel card, a card that can *become* Steel, or even a card to transform with The Tower. The Devil is decent for money but doesn't directly contribute to the scoring strategy. Rerolling could be interesting for Tarot cards (Chariot for Steel cards) or Planet cards (especially Pluto with the Telescope).\n\nWith $34, I'm thinking of buying the Standard Pack first. It's the lowest-risk move, and if I don't get anything useful, I'll consider rerolling. I've calculated I have 16 Steel cards based on the Steel Joker's multiplier.\n\nThe boss of this Ante is potentially Crimson Heart, or some other boss, but it seems there might be an issue. If I have Hieroglyph and Petroglyph, I'm deep into the run.\n\nSo, here's the action plan: I want to `buy_booster 1`, the Standard Pack. Buying \"The Devil\" is an option but doesn't directly support the Steel strategy. Rerolling is good if nothing comes out of the first purchase. I'll make sure to get the booster first.\n\nLooks like the formatting is right for the command, it's just a simple action. It's not the end of the world if I don't use The Devil, since I am prioritizing Steel cards. I am checking the current game state to make sure I am on track from the previous run.\n\nOkay, let's just proceed with the pack. The Steel Joker is going to go hard, so let's get that pack.\nI'm going to `action: \"buy_booster\", positions: [1]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
