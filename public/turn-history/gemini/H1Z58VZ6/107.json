{"reasoning":"**Focusing on the High Card Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase, aiming to beat this game on Ante 8. I'm currently on Ante 4, round 11, and the High Card strategy is still my go-to. It's Level 5 and I've played it 14 times, so the Telescope Voucher is key here. That guarantees a Planet card for High Card, which, since it's my most played hand, means Pluto.\n\nLooking at my Jokers, I've got DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. They're a solid group.\n\nNow, here are the choices in front of me: Pluto, Jupiter, and Mercury. Given my focus on High Card, Pluto is the obvious play here. It boosts High Card by +1 Mult and +10 chips. Leveling up High Card is crucial, and going from Level 5 to 6 is the immediate goal.\n\nThe command is `select <pack_card_position>`. Since Pluto is in the first position, the action is `select 1`. Let's confirm: the action is \"select\", positions are [1], I'm not playing a hand, and I'm not scoring. Everything is valid, the schema is correct, and it's parseable. Time to execute.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
