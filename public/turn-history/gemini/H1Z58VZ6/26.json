{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 3, Round 3, and I'm in the SHOP phase. I've got $7 to work with. My inventory is looking pretty decent with a few solid Jokers: Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Red Card (which I'm aiming to build up), Blue Joker, and Scholar. I'm maxed out on Jokers at 5, and I have zero consumables. I have the Telescope voucher, which is nice for Celestial pack consistency.\n\nLooking at the shop, The Magician is free, a Standard Pack is also free, and Hieroglyph is a tempting $10 buy. My primary goal right now is score/economy, focusing on building up that Red Card.\n\nThe key play is clearly to leverage the free Standard Pack to immediately boost Red Card's multiplier. Since skipping the Standard Pack gives a +3 Mult for Red Card. So, my immediate plan is: buy the standard pack, skip it next round, and buy the magician, though I could have skipped the Magician to reroll (not recommended here).\n\nI'll execute this action right away since it's free. My action is therefore, `buy_booster 1`, which is the Standard Pack.\n\n**Decision: Buy Standard Pack (Booster).**\n\nOkay, I'm buying the Standard Pack.\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
