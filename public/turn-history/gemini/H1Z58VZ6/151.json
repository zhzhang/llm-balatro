{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop Before the Boss**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5, Round 14, big blind cleared, and heading into the shop. I have a healthy $42, which is good. I've got a decent Joker setup: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm (a copy of Ride the Bus), Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and DNA. I'm rocking two consumables: The Empress and The Moon. Voucher-wise, I'm holding Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. My High Card hand is at level 6 – that’s my main play, and it's been working.\n\nThe shop is showing Photograph, Rocket, an Arcana Pack, and a Jumbo Celestial Pack. Photograph has X2 mult on the first face card, which is bad with Ride the Bus. Rocket is an economy Joker, but I don't really need it right now with $42. I'm full on Jokers, so I'd need to sell something.\n\nThe Arm, the boss, decreases the level of the played hand, so I *need* to level up High Card. I have Telescope, which means the Jumbo Celestial Pack *will* contain Pluto, which is a High Card planet. This is a guaranteed level-up for my main strategy. Leveling High Card increases base chips and mult, which is crucial as Ante increases.\n\nI'm thinking about the Rocket; it's scaling economy, but not right now. I already have +42 mult from Ride the Bus and Brainstorm, plus +10 mult from Mail-In Rebate. I have chip Jokers (Blue Joker, DNA). Rocket may be a long-term play, but I need a immediate power boost to mitigate the effect of The Arm on my primary hand.\n\nSo, I have 5/5 Joker slots. I'm going to skip Rocket, at least for now. My plan:\n\n1.  **Buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack and use the planet immediately.** Telescope guarantees Pluto, leveling up my High Card.\n2.  Check the Arcana Pack if I have some money left over.\n3.  Reroll or Proceed.\n\nOkay, checking the Jumbo Celestial Pack first is the right move. The booster action is `buy_booster`.\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}` - the pack.\n\nWait, I should check the Arcana pack too. But the priority is the level up. No, wait, if the booster has a use-immediately card (which a celestial one will!), no action needed before buying.\n\nCurrent Money: $42. Jumbo Celestial Pack is $4 (Clearance Sale!).\n\nIt's the Celestial pack first.\n\nThe Celestial pack will probably have a card that needs to be played. The rules say \"Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards to be used immediately.\" No need to create inventory space. Same goes for the Arcana pack.\n\nSo, decision: Buy Jumbo Celestial Pack.\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\nWait, double-checking, I should make sure I don't miss any other obvious plays. But $42 is enough to ensure I don't run out.\n\nThe boss: \"The Arm\" (decreases hand level). Leveling High Card is really important!\n\nAction: `buy_booster` with position 2 (Jumbo Celestial Pack).\n\nDouble-checking the schema, I need action: `buy_booster`, with positions `[2]`.\n\nLet's verify the order of shop items. It's: Shop Cards: 1: Photograph, 2: Rocket. Shop Boosters: 1: Arcana Pack, 2: Jumbo Celestial Pack. Yep, position 2 is correct.\n\nI'm set: `buy_booster` with position 2.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
