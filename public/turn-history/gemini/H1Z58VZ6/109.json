{"reasoning":"**Strategic Card Selection: Prioritizing \"Ride the Bus\" and DNA Synergy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4, Round 11. I've got $38 and a pretty interesting set of Jokers: DNA, Brainstorm (copying DNA), Blue Joker (+132 Chips), Mail-In Rebate (+10 Mult), and the crucial \"Ride the Bus\" (+15 Mult). \"Ride the Bus\" is the cornerstone – it scales up with consecutive non-face card hands. DNA adds copies to the deck on the first hand (doubled by Brainstorm, *nice*), and I'm sticking with my High Card strategy (Level 6). So, let's break down the choices in front of me.\n\nChoice 1: Queen of Hearts (+30 chips). Nope. Face card. Playing this will reset \"Ride the Bus,\" a deal-breaker.\n\nChoice 2: Stone Card (+50 chips). Okay, this is looking promising. No rank, meaning it won't trigger the \"Ride the Bus\" reset. It's a flat chip boost for my High Card play. Plus, it can be played as a High Card. It won't work in certain hand types (Straights, Flushes), but those are irrelevant to my High Card build. DNA can duplicate it, which is the key consideration for this round.\n\nChoice 3: 10 of Clubs (Wild). This is tempting. A non-face card, so safe for \"Ride the Bus.\" And DNA can duplicate it.\n\nNow, let's think bigger picture. \"Ride the Bus\" is my multiplier. I want to keep it running. The Queen is out. Stone Card gives a flat 50 Chips per play. The 10 of Clubs is just a standard card. The Stone Card is the most efficient choice in terms of its value as a card, because it's not a face card and can therefore be played safely with \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nI'm leaning towards the Stone Card. If I take the Stone Card, I can use DNA to make more Stone Cards.\n\nMy High Card Level 6 base is 55 chips, the Blue Joker provides 132 chips, and Ride the Bus is already up to +15.\n\nSo, with the Stone Card, my potential looks like this: (55 + 132 + 50) * (31) = 237 * 31 = 7,347 chips.\nWith the 10 of Clubs: (55 + 132 + 10) * (31) = 197 * 31 = 6,107 chips.\n\nThe Stone Card is the clear winner for my High Card build. It's a non-face card, boosts my chip count, *and* I can duplicate it with DNA.\n\n**Action: Select Choice 2 (Stone Card)**. The Queen resets \"Ride the Bus\", so it's a non-starter. The 10 is safe but less impactful.\n\nCurrent Joker order: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus. The setup is perfect for the first hand of the round, Brainstorm copies DNA. I will rearrange Jokers later in the round.\n\n**Final Confirmation:**\n\n1.  Queen\n2.  **Stone**\n3.  10 of Clubs\n\n**Select 2!** That Stone Card is looking beautiful right now. Let's get that multiplier growing!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
