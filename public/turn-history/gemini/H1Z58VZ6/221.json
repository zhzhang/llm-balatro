{"reasoning":"**Focusing on the High Card Strategy**\n\nOkay, here we are: Ante 6, Round 19, Shop Phase. My immediate goal is clear: beat this Ante 6, as I've already handled the small blind. The game step is PLANET_PACK, so I just bought a Jumbo Celestial Pack. I have a decent Joker setup with Steel Joker (X2.2), Brainstorm (copying Steel), Ride the Bus (+27 Mult), DNA (+50 Chips, foil), and Blue Joker (+158 Chips). Nothing to consume, and $48 in the bank.\n\nCrucially, my High Card is level 9, which is my focus with the Telescope Voucher active, which is relevant for the Celestial Packs containing a planet for my most played hand. I've played High Card 26 times so far.\n\nNow the pack choices: Pluto, Earth, Saturn, Neptune, and Jupiter. The strategy is all about High Card. Pluto levels up High Card. The others level up hands I *rarely* play: Full House, Straight, Straight Flush, Flush. Seems pretty straightforward: the obvious best play is to level up my High Card from level 9 to 10. That's a solid increase in both base chips and base multiplier for my primary scoring hand.\n\nSo, I need to use the `select` command to pick Pluto. Pluto is in the first position in the booster pack choices. I don't need any particular cards in my hand to select a planet card. Time to build the command. `select 1`.\n\nDouble-checking my thinking: Action \"select\" is for booster packs, position is [1]. That looks right. There's no compelling reason to sell anything or rearrange Jokers. Pluto is definitely the best choice to support my main strategy.\n\nSo the final command is: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1], \"intended_hand_type\": \"high card\", \"estimated_chips\": null}`. Double-checked that definition: `select <pack_card_position>` is correct. Sending it.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
