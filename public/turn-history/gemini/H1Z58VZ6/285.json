{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: Ante 8, Round 25 - The Art of Scaling**\n\nOkay, here we are, facing the Small Blind with a clear objective: hit 50,000 chips. Let's see what we're working with. I've got a solid set of Jokers: DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, and Blue Joker. The hand itself is…interesting. A mix of Steel cards, a face card, wilds, and a Stone card.\n\nThe key here is scaling, especially the Steel Joker. It's currently at X3.4 Mult, and that's going to be crucial. I have a Steel card (5 of Hearts) that's looking like the play. If I use it, here's what happens: DNA will copy it (twice because of Brainstorm), permanently boosting my deck with Steel cards. That's a long-term play, ensuring that Steel Joker gets stronger and stronger for future rounds.\n\nLet's do some quick calculations. Playing the Steel card as a High Card should net me a base of 155 chips, then plus the card value (5) plus DNA's bonus chips (+50) plus Blue Joker (+168). That's a total of 378 chips. And my mult is going to be 16 (base) + 34 (Ride the Bus). But Steel Joker is key here: my total mult is (16 + 34) * 3.4 = 170. This results in a total of 378 * 170 = 64,260. Nice! This exceeds the target of 50,000. It doesn't seem quite as high as the 90k from last round. Perhaps I was holding other Steel cards? Playing the 8 of Spades and *keeping* the 5 of Hearts in hand would result in a score of around 104k. However, the long term scaling via DNA is more important for the upcoming Boss Blind.\n\nA quick check confirms that the 5 of Hearts is *not* a face card, so Ride the Bus won't reset. Also, DNA specifically *copies* the Steel effect, which is important. This feels like the right move, even though I'll be losing the Steel card's X1.5 Mult this hand. I'm focusing on future value and scaling.\n\nI'm playing the 5 of Hearts.\n\nJust to be sure, the Stone card in the hand is tempting. I could play that for higher immediate chips, but I need to focus on Steel cards for my future scaling.\n\nThe Jokers are in the correct order for the DNA/Brainstorm combo.\n\nOne final calculation: Ride the Bus is going to add +34 *before* or *after* scoring for this hand. So the current Mult is going to be *after* playing, not before.\n\nI've got the data I need, now it is time to output.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"play\",\n  \"positions\": [4],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": \"high card\",\n  \"estimated_chips\": 64260\n}\n```\n\n\n\n","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4]"}
