{"reasoning":"**Decision Time: High Card & Steel Joker Build**\n\nOkay, let's see where we're at. Ante 6/8, and I've got $16 in the bank. My hand is rocking a pretty solid setup: two Steel Jokers, a Brainstorm for copying, Ride the Bus adding a good chunk of points, DNA for that foil boost, and a Blue Joker for some serious chip generation. High Card strategy is at Level 9, which is good, but I need to keep pushing it. I just grabbed Paint Brush, which gives me that extra hand size.\n\nI've got a few options in the shop: Stone Joker, Green Joker, and an Arcana Pack. Stone and Green are irrelevant to this build; I'm focusing on strengthening High Card, with my Steel Jokers. I need to find cards that help amplify my current strategy.\n\nArcana Packs are key right now. I'm looking for Chariot, which would enhance the Steel Jokers, Pluto to level up High Card, and potentially Death, Hanged Man, or Strength for some deck manipulation.\n\nGiven all this, the move is clear: I'm buying the Arcana Pack. Let's execute that. `buy_booster 1`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
