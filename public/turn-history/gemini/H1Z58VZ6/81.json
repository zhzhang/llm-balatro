{"reasoning":"**Current Decision Point: SHOP Phase**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 4, Round 9. I've got $21 to play with. My Joker setup is pretty solid: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate (Holo), and Ride the Bus (Holo).  I also have a Death consumable, and Vouchers: Hieroglyph, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. My most played hand is High Card – I've used it ten times.  The Telescope Voucher is clutch because it guarantees me a Pluto card (the planet upgrade for High Card) in Celestial Packs.\n\nLooking at the Shop, I've got a few options: To Do List ($4), Saturn ($2), a Standard Pack ($3), and a Jumbo Celestial Pack ($4). I can't reroll. The To Do List is tempting for the Foil bonus, but I already have Blue Joker providing a good chip boost, and my joker slots are full. I'd have to sell something for that. Saturn upgrades Straight – not my focus. The Standard Pack might give me a good card to DNA, but the Jumbo Celestial Pack is the clear priority because of that Telescope synergy. It *guarantees* a Pluto card which will drastically improve my High Card scaling. It's an automatic buy.\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack is the most efficient upgrade. I'm going to spend the $4 on it. It will put me at $17. The pack says it contains 5 planet cards and I get to choose one.\n\nMy JSON output needs to be perfect for this game and I will execute the following action: `buy_booster 2`.\n\nMy JSON schema requires an action, position, and, optionally, other items. I'm keeping my Joker order as is for now.\n\nI'm ready to pull the trigger.\n\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [2]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
