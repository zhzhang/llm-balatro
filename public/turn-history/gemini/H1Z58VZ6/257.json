{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: SHOP Phase**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. We're in the SHOP phase of round 22, and the Ante is 7/8. My primary goal is to maximize the High Card strategy. I have $40 to work with, a few Jokers (DNA, Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker) with Brainstorm currently copying DNA, and two consumables: The Tower and Mercury. My High Card hand is at level 14, and Pair is at level 2.\n\nI just got Mercury from using the High Priestess Tarot card.  Mercury levels up my Pair hand. I could sell it, but it's generally better to use it for free stats. The Tower needs a card in hand to work, so I can't use it right now in the SHOP phase.\n\nThe shop offers Runner (straight scaling) and Earth (Full House level). Neither of these fit my High Card strategy, so they're not useful purchases right now.\n\nMy options are clear: use Mercury to level up my Pair hand, and then maybe reroll the shop, or just proceed to the next phase. Rerolling costs $5, which I can afford. However, there's no immediate need to reroll. I could consider rearranging Jokers, but the current order (Brainstorm copying DNA) is ideal for the start of the next round.  My priority right now is getting as many cards as I can.\n\nSince I have Mercury, I'll use it.  I'm going to `use_consumable` with position 2 to level up the Pair hand.\n\nI'm thinking ahead to the next phase, but for this specific action, using Mercury is the best choice. Let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider.\n\nI need to create a JSON output. It must be a valid structure: `{\"action\": \"use_consumable\", \"positions\": [2], \"intended_hand_type\": null, \"estimated_chips\": null}`.\n\nOkay, let's re-examine that plan. It seems like the obvious choice is to use Mercury. The Tower is out because it needs a card. The current shop items are not desirable, and rerolling is optional.  I need to use `use_consumable` on position `2`.\n\nMy final decision is to use Mercury, and it gives the following JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"action\":\"use_consumable\",\"positions\":[2],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
