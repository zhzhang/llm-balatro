{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decision: Jumbo Arcana Pack Acquisition**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante is 5/8, Round 13. I'm in the Shop phase, sitting on $38. Big Blind is next, so I need to optimize this shop. My current Joker setup is solid: Blue Joker duplication with Brainstorm, DNA for card duplication, Mail-In Rebate for economy, and Ride the Bus for scaling. I'm at 5/5 Jokers, so no new ones unless I sell. I also have The Empress and The Moon consumables.\n\nI have some vouchers available: Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nLooking at the shop, Showman is interesting for duplicating Jokers, but I don't have space. Wily Joker gives chips for 3-of-a-kind, not useful for my High Card strategy. Jumbo Arcana Pack and Jumbo Standard Pack are both $4 each, a good price due to Clearance Sale.\n\nMy current money is $38. I want to stay above $25 to maximize interest, so I need to spend wisely. Spending $4 gets me to $34, which is fine.\n\nThe DNA Joker is primed and ready, but my focus is to duplicate high-value cards, like Steel or Stone cards.\n\nGiven my setup and the current state of the game, the Jumbo Arcana Pack is the best bet here. Tarot cards provide strong scaling and deck manipulation, and I can use the cards immediately.\n\nSo, I'm going with the Jumbo Arcana Pack. \n\nBefore I do, I'll quickly double-check everything: $38, a $4 pack leaves me with $34. It's a good move.\n\nOkay, let's solidify the plan and make the purchase: `buy_booster 1`. Then, the goal for this buy is: Improve the deck or gain economy.\n\nOh, and the Mail-In Rebate is at Rank 7. I'll need to look for Sevens to discard next round. Ride the Bus is already at +19 Mult, so I need to avoid Face Cards to increase the multiplier as much as possible.\n\nAction: Buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack - `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
