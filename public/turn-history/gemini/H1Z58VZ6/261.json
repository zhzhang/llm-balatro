{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 7, Round 22. My primary objective is to get to the next blind, the Big Blind. I have $27. My current Joker setup is solid: DNA (foil, copying single-card hands), Brainstorm (copies DNA), Steel Joker (multiplier based on Steel cards), Ride the Bus (multiplier for non-face hands), and Blue Joker (chip generation based on deck size). I'm at the max of 5 Jokers. My consumable slots are also full, with The Tower and Justice applied.\n\nLooking at the shop, the Mystic Summit card is available, offering +15 multiplier when zero discards are made, but I already have Ride the Bus giving me +32 for non-face hands. It's not worth selling a joker for. Rerolling is too expensive at $7, as it'll put me below the $25 interest threshold, and the odds of getting a significant upgrade (like a relevant planet) in a single reroll are too low to justify the cost. Given my strong current scoring with the DNA/Steel Joker/Ride the Bus combination, it's best to keep scaling. I can't buy or use consumables.\n\nSince the shop doesn't offer any compelling improvements and rerolling is economically inefficient, I should proceed to the next round. The game step is currently SHOP, and my available command is `round_select`. *Wait*, this means the logical next step is Blind Select.\n\nSo, I'm confirming that `round_select` is the correct action and I should click it.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
