{"reasoning":"**Current Turn Analysis: High Card Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the Shop phase, Ante 5 of 8, Round 16, and I've got $49. My current Jokers are solid: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm (copying Ride the Bus - nice!), Blue Joker for chips, DNA, and Steel Joker for mult. I have 'The Moon', but it's not relevant at the moment. I also have a bunch of vouchers: Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Petroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. Hand levels are looking good, High Card is Level 7.\n\nI've got a couple of cards that I won't be using: Scary Face and Shortcut. The important thing is the single Celestial Pack I see for sale in position 1, cost $3. The Telescope voucher is key here - it guarantees I'll get Pluto in the Celestial Pack. I used a Jumbo Celestial Pack previously to get to Level 7. Now I want to get the next levels. Clearance Sale means this Celestial Pack is cheap.\n\nThe logical move is to buy the Celestial Pack at position 1, which will cost $3. That leaves me with $46.\n\nMy plan: I'm going to send the command to buy the Celestial Pack in position 1: `buy_booster 1`.\n\nThe JSON for this should be:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nI'm double-checking because I know I need to be precise. It meets the schema requirements: \"action\", \"positions\", \"intended\\_hand\\_type\", and \"estimated\\_chips\". No need to sell or reroll. The Moon isn't needed right now. Everything is efficient here, this is the right move. I need to level up High Card.\n```\n```\nSo, with that in mind, send `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
