{"reasoning":"**My Turn, My Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. Ante 4/8, Big Blind's breathing down my neck. I need 2657 chips to clear this blind; I can do this. I have three hands, three discards, and a strong set of Jokers to work with: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. My hand looks solid too, with a Steel King, a +4 Mult card, and a Wild card that generates a Tarot. And, crucially, I have a Death consumable, and space for a Tarot, so let's use that.\n\nThe current strategy is straightforward: discard the 10 of Diamonds from position 8 to get a Tarot card, then use \"Death\" to make the Queen (pos 6) the Steel King (pos 5), then play a high card to trigger all the multipliers.\n\nPreviously, I used \"The Hierophant\" to improve cards; the hand is slightly different now. It is time to make the most of what is on offer. The 10 of Diamonds in position 8 is the key. Discarding is my highest priority. This is the move.\n\nBefore I commit, let's look at the numbers. Discarding will give a Tarot. My total score will be calculated from the remaining cards.\n\n*   I'll score enough to clear the blind. I have a chance to double my Steel King with \"Death\".\n\nOkay. The play is clear: I discard the 10 of Diamonds (pos 8). *Discard* is the way. This is the best move. Now, it's about discarding the 10 of Diamonds from pos 8, since doing so gets a free Tarot.\n\nI have decided. The action is `discard`, positions is `[8]`.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [8]"}
