{"reasoning":"**Navigating the Shop with Empty Pockets**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 2/8, Round 4, and I'm completely broke. Zero dollars to my name. Let's see... my current Joker lineup is pretty solid: Mail-In Rebate (holo, +10 Mult), Ride the Bus (+3 Mult), Blue Joker (+104 Chips), Scholar (Aces: +20 Chips, +4 Mult), and DNA (Copy 1st hand single card). The Magician is my only consumable, and I've got Telescope and Hieroglyph vouchers.\n\nI've got nothing to buy. The Lusty Joker is tempting, but at $5, it's a pipe dream. The Buffoon Pack is also out of reach. Rerolling the shop is pointless without funds. Using The Magician is a non-starter; I'm in the Shop phase, so there are no cards in my hand to target.\n\nSelling the consumable for $1 would be a desperate move. It won't get me anything in the shop. Selling a Joker is out of the question; this build is synergistic and scaling well. I'm going to keep them.\n\nLet's quickly check the Joker order. Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, Scholar, and DNA. The order of the +Mult and +Chips jokers doesn't matter mathematically (without any xMult effects) since they are additive, but I keep DNA to the far right, and usually the order is chips, then mult, but it's fine.\n\nSince I'm financially bankrupt, the best move is to proceed to the next round. I'm going to have to make do with what I have and hope for some luck in the next blind. No point selling anything; I already used my money to buy the Hieroglyph earlier. The shop items are unaffordable. Time to move on and see what the next round brings.\n\nAction: `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
