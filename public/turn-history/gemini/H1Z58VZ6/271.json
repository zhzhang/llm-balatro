{"reasoning":"**Analysis of the Blind Select Phase**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 23. Currently in the BLIND\\_SELECT phase. The Blind is \"The Eye,\" demanding 70,000 chips, with the dreaded \"No repeat hand types this round\" clause. My inventory is as follows: Jokers (DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, Blue Joker), Consumables (The Tower, Justice), and a measly $33. My primary strategy is High Card, currently at Level 15 (145 chips, 15 Mult). Recent High Card scores have been hovering in the 50k-70k range.\n\nMy initial assessment is that I should *easily* be able to beat the Boss. The Eye is only an issue if I *can't* beat it in one shot, which seems unlikely. The DNA Joker, which triggers on the *first* hand of the round, combined with Brainstorm (which copies DNA), means I get a bonus +100 chips on my first hand. I'm rocking Ride the Bus (+33 Mult), Steel Joker (X3.4 Mult), and Blue Joker (+180 chips), providing a multiplier and chip boost.\n\nSo, let's roughly estimate a High Card score: Base chips 145 + Blue Joker 180 + DNA foil 50 + card = 385 chips. Then, base Mult 15 + Ride the Bus 33 = 48 Mult. Then multiply it by 3.4 for the Steel Joker for a base score of 62,844. I've been getting similar scores in the past. But, with a Steel card in hand, which is likely, this score jumps to 94,266, easily beating the target.\n\nI need to decide if I want to reroll the Boss. I have $33, but rerolling costs $10, which I probably need less than the current boss. With my current setup, I should have no trouble hitting 70k. Even if my first High Card doesn't quite clear it, I can follow with a Pair or Three of a Kind to ensure I make it. Even if I fail, I have a back-up plan.\n\nLet's quickly run the numbers again. Using a 1-card hand (High Card) to trigger DNA and Brainstorm, I can easily one-shot this. This is looking *very* achievable, I think I will just do the standard `play_round` move.\n\nI should also note that I have a couple of consumables, The Tower and Justice, but they're not useful in the Blind Select phase. The `use_consumable` command is available, but I don't have a hand to target. So, these are of no concern.\n\nThe key to victory here is that I must win in one hand. This is the only way to avoid the \"No repeat hand types\" restriction. If I fail, I'm forced to use Pair (40 chips, 4 Mult) or Three of a Kind (70 chips, 7 Mult), with a much lower score. I need to win in one hand, which is why I'm focusing on High Card.\n\nDo I need to rearrange my Jokers? No. DNA at position 1, Brainstorm at position 2 is the correct order. Brainstorm copies the leftmost joker, and DNA needs to be at the beginning for its trigger.\n\n**Final Decision:** I am going to enter the round with the command `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
