{"reasoning":"**My Analysis for the Next Step**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 6, Round 19, $40 in the bank. I've got a solid High Card build going, focused on scaling with Steel Joker, DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker. My main goal is to duplicate Steel cards using DNA and Brainstorm. High Card is Level 10, giving a good base. Telescope means I'm guaranteed Pluto cards from Celestial Packs.\n\nI'm focused on hitting a minimum of ~45000 in the Big Blind. My previous hand, though, scored closer to 23k. I can hit ~24.5k with one High Card, but I will need to play multiple hands or ensure I have Steel cards in hand to scale properly. I have Grabber + Hieroglyph, which give me 4 hands.\n\nI could reroll for Celestial Packs or useful Tarot/Spectral cards, but the reroll cost is $6, and I want to stick to my strategy. I've already optimized the Joker order with DNA and Brainstorm first, thanks to my previous `rearrange_jokers` action. So I'm ready to move forward.\n\nI have $40, so rerolling would be okay, but I can go to the round and get max interest. Previous reasoning was to `round_select` and save money for later, which is now the current state after having taken the `rearrange_jokers` action. I think proceeding to the next round is the best choice here, following my previous turn's logic.\n\nI've checked the shop – Riff-raff and Hallucination aren't useful. The Vouchers and Booster are not helpful either.\n\nSo, I'm going to `round_select`. This seems like the most straightforward and logical move after the Joker rearrangement. I'm aiming for \"high card\", as usual, and estimate my score to be around ~55000, which I think is a good estimation based on my Joker calculations. I need Steel cards in hand for this strategy, and hopefully can copy them with Brainstorm and DNA to scale. I have 4 hands, so I should be okay.\n\nI'm confident I can make it through the round and will choose `round_select`.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
