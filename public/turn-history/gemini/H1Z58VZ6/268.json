{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Ante 7 Boss Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7, aiming to beat the upcoming boss blind. I've got $36. My current Jokers are solid: DNA (Foil, +50 chips), Brainstorm (copying DNA), Ride the Bus (+33 Mult, non-face scaling), Steel Joker (X3.2 Mult), and Blue Joker (+178 Chips, deck size scaling). I'm sitting on The Tower (Stone Card) and Justice (Glass Card) with a full inventory. High Card is my main hand strategy, currently Level 15 (145 chips, 15 mult). Vouchers are less relevant in this decision.\n\nLooking at the shop, there's a Credit Card for a dollar (not needed), a Ceremonial Dagger for $4 (tempting, but risky – it would mean selling a crucial joker or losing a consumable slot. My current Jokers are too synergistic to sacrifice, so I'll pass.) and a Standard Pack for $3. A $5 Reroll is also available, but for now it's not needed.\n\nThe key here is deck synergy and scaling. DNA and Brainstorm allow me to duplicate cards, especially high-value non-face cards (like Foil 10s or Steel cards). Steel Joker scales directly with the number of Steel cards in my deck. Ride the Bus wants me to keep faces in my hand. Blue Joker wants me to keep a full deck.\n\nThe Standard Pack is cheap because of Clearance Sale and could contain a Steel card, Gold card, or another useful card. *That's the play.* It's the cheapest way to potentially boost Steel Joker. I've already bought the Celestial Pack and got Pluto. I want to buy a Standard Pack.\n\nBuying the pack costs $3, leaving me with $33, well above the $25 interest threshold. I'm not using the shop for a consumable, and leaving the shop would be foolish. I don't need the Dagger. I've got a plan, and the pack aligns with it.\n\nSo, the action is `buy_booster` with position 1 (Standard Pack).\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
