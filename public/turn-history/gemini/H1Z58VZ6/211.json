{"reasoning":"**Strategic Round Execution - Ante 6/8**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in Ante 6, with 20,000 chips needed, and I've got a solid setup. The main goals are to maximize chip output for the round win, while focusing on long-term scaling with the right Jokers. DNA, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and the Gold cards are the key here.\n\nFirst, let's assess the state.  I have 4 hands remaining and 2 discards. Key Jokers are Ride the Bus (+26 Mult), Steel Joker (X2.2 Mult), Brainstorm (copying leftmost Joker), DNA (+50 Chips if played as the first card), and Blue Joker (+130 Chips).  The consumables are also in good shape: I sold the Judgement Tarot, and have The Star available.\n\nThe optimal play involves sequencing.  I need to get that sweet Tarot card from discarding the 9 of Spades (Position 1, creates a Tarot when discarded). I have 1/2 Tarot consumable slots filled (The Star is in that slot), and I know there is room for the Tarot card.\n\nI can make the round even bigger by rearranging the jokers. This is the optimal configuration:\n\n1.  Steel Joker (for maximum Mult)\n2.  Brainstorm (copying Steel Joker = 2.2 * 2.2 = x4.84 Mult)\n3.  Ride the Bus (for scaling)\n4.  DNA (Chips)\n5.  Blue Joker (Chips)\n\nThe command to achieve this with the current joker order is `rearrange_jokers 2 3 1 4 5`.  But since that will take an action, I want to see if discarding first is better.\n\nI have 9S, 3S, 7H, 5H, 9C, AceD, AceD, 7D, and 2D. 7H has a mult, and the rest are Gold cards, AceD. These need to be kept.\n\nI have decided that the best move here is to discard the 9S, 3S, 9C and 7D to get the Tarot.  I will have two discards left. Discarding the 9S card is a must, to get the free Tarot. So I'll go with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"discard\",\n  \"positions\": [1, 2, 5, 8]\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures I trigger the discard effect for the 9S, and the two Jokers will combine well to beat the 20,000 chip target, with a total of 51,342. This is the correct action and I should stick to it.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,8]"}
