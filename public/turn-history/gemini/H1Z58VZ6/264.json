{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization for Maximum Score**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan: Ante 7/8, Round 23, with a goal of 52,500 chips (Big Blind). I've got a solid hand, but the Joker positioning isn't optimized for maximum scaling and multiplicative effects. My current Joker lineup includes DNA (copying), Steel Joker (X-mult), Ride the Bus (+Mult per consecutive non-face hand), Brainstorm (copying another Joker), and Blue Joker (+ chips per card). I have a foil 10 of hearts. I have $27.\n\nThe previous player action was slightly off. The crucial issue here is the order of my Jokers. \"Ride the Bus\" is currently *after* \"Steel Joker\", which means the additive multiplier from \"Ride the Bus\" is being applied *after* the multiplicative effect of the \"Steel Joker\".  This significantly reduces my potential score.  My primary focus, in this turn, needs to be correcting this and optimizing.\n\nThe ideal Joker setup is to have \"Ride the Bus\" apply its additive mult *before* the \"Steel Joker's\" multiplicative mult. I can also leverage DNA's ability to duplicate cards. The best strategy is to keep Brainstorm on DNA for now, to ensure the strongest initial card scaling. I can always change this later.\n\nLet's break down the optimal order to maximize the score:\n\n1.  **DNA:** This will add an additional card to the deck. DNA is leftmost.\n2.  **Brainstorm:** I want this to copy DNA.\n3.  **Ride the Bus:** This gives a massive additive multiplier that's essential for score scaling.\n4.  **Steel Joker:** Provides a multiplicative mult, that increases the base score.\n5.  **Blue Joker:** A nice chip bonus.\n\nI need to make sure to rearrange the Jokers. To fix this, I need to use the `rearrange_jokers` command with the correct permutation of the indices to change the order. The current order is : DNA, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, Brainstorm, Blue Joker. The index order is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The ideal order is: DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, Blue Joker, that is, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5. So, the command is `rearrange_jokers 1 4 3 2 5`.\n\nI need to check the math. With the new order, playing a single 10 of Hearts (Foil) will trigger DNA and Brainstorm (creating two copies), base chips would be boosted by 401 and the multiplier by 220.8. This will give me a score of 88,540, which easily exceeds the target of 52,500.\n\nI should make the `rearrange_jokers` command first to fix the Joker setup and then play a single card on the next turn.\n\nAction: `rearrange_jokers 1 4 3 2 5`\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [1,4,3,2,5]"}
