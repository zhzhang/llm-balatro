{"reasoning":"**Celestial Pack Acquisition - Prioritizing Pluto**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. We're in Ante 6, Round 20, Shop phase, with $47 to play with. My strategy is still High Card, leveraging Pluto to level it up, and boosting the Steel Joker with DNA and Brainstorm to copy Steel cards. Ride the Bus is in play, so no face cards. Blue Joker is providing chips, but High Card levels are doing that too, so not a huge loss there.\n\nMy current Jokers are DNA (foil, copying single cards), Brainstorm (copies DNA), Steel Joker (multiplies based on Steel cards), Ride the Bus (multiplies based on no scoring face cards), and Blue Joker (chips based on cards in deck). The Tower is my Stone Card enhancement, and I'm holding a few good Vouchers like the Telescope (Pluto guarantee in Planet packs) and Clearance Sale (cheaper stuff).\n\nThe shop has Burglar ($4), Business Card ($3), and, crucially, a Celestial Pack ($3). We already bought and used the Jumbo Pack. According to my plan from turns 234/235, I intended to buy the *regular* Celestial Pack now. It's the only booster pack left. The shop position is now showing Celestial Pack in position 1.\n\nI *need* to get that Celestial Pack for another shot at Pluto. My focus is still High Card, so I'm not deviating. \n\nThere's also Burglar, which is interesting, but buying it involves selling a Joker. While it's tempting for the extra hands, especially with DNA and Brainstorm, losing discards is annoying, though manageable with High Card. The previous turns focused on the packs.\n\nSo, the action is simple: `buy_booster 1`. The shop is showing the Celestial Pack in position 1, just as planned. Time to get that pack and hope for Pluto! Let's execute that command.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
