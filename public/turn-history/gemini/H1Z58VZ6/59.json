{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Play: Grabbing the Celestial Advantage**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're in Ante 3/8, Round 7, and I've got $16. Small blind is down, and I've got a solid Joker lineup: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker (+112 Chips), Mail-In Rebate (Jack, +10 Mult), and Ride the Bus (+7 Mult). I'm rocking Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale vouchers, which is pretty sweet. My Hand Levels are decent, High Card is Level 1, Three of a Kind is Level 3. I'm running a High Card/DNA build for now, focusing on copying and thinning the deck and scaling Ride the Bus.\n\nThe shop's options are: Odd Todd and Sly Joker, both chip-boost Jokers, but Blue Joker already gives me a massive chip bonus. So, no replacements there. Then there are the Celestial and Standard packs.\n\nBecause of the Telescope voucher, I *know* the Jumbo Celestial Pack is going to contain the Planet card for the most-played hand, which is High Card (6 times). That means the pack will have Pluto! High Card is only Level 1 right now, so leveling it up is a top priority.\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack is only $4, thanks to Clearance Sale, and I've got the Telescope to guarantee Pluto is in the pack. I'll have $12 left. I'm going for the Planet card, especially with Telescope. The standard pack might give a good card to copy, but Pluto is more valuable than that right now.\n\nSo, the plan is crystal clear:\n\n1.  **Buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack.**\n\nAfter that, I'll see if the standard pack is worth it after the Celestial Pack.\n\nThe final action is: `buy_booster 1` (Jumbo Celestial Pack).\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
