It's Ante 1, Round 1 after the Big Blind. I'm sitting with $5 and this Holographic Mail-In Rebate \\u2013 a fantastic +10 Mult! That's a huge boost, especially early on. My immediate goal is to survive this Boss Blind and start building some interest, setting up for a solid long-term strategy. I have a few shop options: Smiley Face, Buffoon Pack, Celestial Pack, and I can't afford the Tarot Merchant or reroll.\\n\\nThe Mail-In Rebate is key. It's going to make clearing these early blinds a breeze. The Boss Blind usually requires around 600-900 chips. Even a simple High Card with the +10 Mult will generate more than enough. A Pair will demolish it. So, my primary thought is, how do I best set myself up for the next few rounds and the early economy?\\n\\nI'm debating between these options. Buying Smiley Face for $4 gives me +5 Mult on face cards. That would give face cards +15 Mult! But I'd be left with only $1, meaning no interest next round. The Buffoon Pack offers a Joker, which could be a huge game-changer, but it's risky. I could get two duds. The Celestial Pack isn't as appealing early on, as hand levels aren't as impactful as raw Mult/Chips from Jokers. Saving my $5 gets me a guaranteed $1 interest at the end of the next round.\\n\\nGiven that I have the Holographic Joker, survival is almost guaranteed, so the most optimal long-term strategy seems to be saving for interest. The Smiley Face is tempting, but not essential. I need to focus on building that economy. I'm already in a strong position with the Holographic Joker.\\n\\nI'm thinking, is there anything else? Oh yeah! The Mail-In Rebate gives me money for discarding Kings. That's a good thing to keep in mind. I now realize the most economical play is to end the shop, as I have $5 and can trigger interest.\\n\\nBut, should I buy Smiley Face? With the Holographic Joker, +10 Mult is already sufficient for this early stage. I need to prioritize building that economy.\\n\\nThe Big Blind was 450 chips. The Boss Blind will be higher, but likely less than 1000 in Ante 1. Since I can survive either with +10 Mult, the economy is more important. Smiley Face and the Buffoon Pack are not \\\"must-buys\\\" at this point.\\n\\nThe prompt requires an action: `round_select`.\\n\\nWait, let's revisit this. $5 to save or $1 to spend.\\n\\nIf I save: $5. End of round: $5 + reward + hands + $1 interest. Total roughly ~$11.\\nIf I buy Smiley Face: $5 - $4 = $1. End of round: $1 + reward ($3 or $4) + hands. Total roughly ~$6.\\n\\nThe economy is better if I save. The Holographic Joker guarantees survival.\\n\\nThe decision is clear: `round_select` to advance.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: round_select\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 11]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: BLIND_SELECT\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Mail-In Rebate.

Five bucks in the bank, and a cool 600 chips to hit. The Goad is in effect, which means spades are debuffed, but I'm not too concerned. I've got my Mail-In Rebate Joker (Holographic, nice!), which should be providing a solid +10 Multiplier.\\n\\nLet's see\\u2026 The Joker's rank is King, which should be the case for this round based on its description \\\"rank changes every round\\\". I am wondering if the game updates the rank immediately when it is purchased, or at the start of a round, and if so, when it will be updated to a different rank, but for now it's a King and I'll keep that in mind.\\n\\nWith that Holographic Mult, even a weak hand should be enough to hit the target. Even a High Card with a non-spade would bring in 165 chips. A Pair would be more than enough with 360. 600 chips? Piece of cake.\\n\\nI've got no consumables to worry about, and only one Joker, so the only real action here is to just `play_round`. Easy win, let's get this done.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: play_round\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 12]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Mail-In Rebate.

I have $5, and the Joker \\\"Mail-In Rebate\\\" is in play \\u2013 a Holo that provides a +10 Mult boost and, crucially, earns me $5 for each discarded King. Right now, its rank is King. The target is 600 chips, and I have four hands and four discards remaining.\\n\\nMy hand consists of:\\n\\n1.  5 of Spades (Debuffed)\\n2.  Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\\n3.  10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\\n4.  2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\\n5.  Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\\n6.  9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\\n7.  Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\\n8.  King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\\n\\nI've got three Aces, which gives me a Three of a Kind. That would give me a massive 819 chips with the Joker's multiplier, easily surpassing the 600 target. I'm also considering a Pair of Aces or even a High Card Ace if the Three of a Kind falls through.\\n\\nThe \\\"Mail-In Rebate\\\" Joker is key here. It provides a rank of King, and I have *one* King in my hand - the King of Diamonds. If I discard the King, I gain $5. My initial thoughts were to try and discard the King to get the $5 for the rebate. That's immediately +10 at the end of the round. Discarding the king is the stronger move for the economy, so the economic gain is more.\\n\\nOkay, let's look at the remaining deck. There are 3 Kings left. There is 1 Ace left in the deck. It's safe to say I can play the 3 Aces and win! I have a high probability to win with a Three of a Kind.\\n\\nGiven that I have the option to generate immediate economic benefit through the \\\"Mail-In Rebate\\\" Joker by discarding the King, it's a no-brainer to *prioritize* discarding the King of Diamonds (index 8) to get the $5. I can then use the extra money to get more interest at the end of the round and it's a stronger move, even if it means sacrificing those high-chip cards for now. Discarding the 5 of Spades (index 1) and 2 of Hearts (index 4) would be ideal to maximize the probability of drawing more Kings.\\n\\nYes! Discarding the King guarantees the $5 and a higher probability to draw a King again.\\n\\nSo, the action is to `discard` the cards at positions `[1, 4, 8]` - the 5 of Spades, 2 of Hearts, and King of Diamonds. This will trigger the Joker and set me up for future hand strength.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand: discard 1 4 8\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Mail-In Rebate.

  "reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision: Round 2 - The Goad**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 1/8, Round 2, facing \"The Goad\" (Spades debuffed). I need 600 chips to clear this blind, and I have a starting $10 after discarding a King for Mail-In Rebate's $5 rebate. The Joker I have is \"Mail-In Rebate\" (Holographic, +10 Multiplier, $5 per King discarded), and its current rank is King. I have 4 hands remaining and 3 discards left.\n\nMy hand consists of a Queen of Spades (debuffed), 9 of Spades (debuffed), an Ace of Hearts (+11 chips), a 10 of Hearts (+10 chips), an Ace of Clubs (+11 chips), a 9 of Clubs (+9 chips), a 2 of Clubs (+2 chips), and an Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips). I can immediately identify a Three of a Kind with the Aces (indices 3, 5, 8).\n\nThe objective is 600 chips. Playing a Three of a Kind at Level 1 (30 base chips, 3 base multiplier).  This hand, with the Aces, scores 30 (base) + 11 + 11 + 11 = 63 chips.  With the Holographic Mail-In Rebate Joker, the multiplier is 3 + 10 = 13.  So, the estimated total is 63 * 13 = 819 chips. 819 > 600. Winning this round is a certainty.\n\nNow, the question is: maximize the play. I have 3 discards left.  Mail-In Rebate incentivizes Kings; discarding one King (earned 5). But with the $10, my current amount gives $2 interest.  If I reach $15, that becomes $3. Getting more money is appealing, but is it worth the risk? There are 3 Kings left in the deck. With 3 discards, the probability of hitting at least one King is approximately 33%. My current hand already has a win.\n\nGiven this is the turn, the most efficient action is to play a guaranteed win for the immediate next move to the shop for deck improvements. Playing now gives $10 + $5 (win) + $4 (hands) = $19 + $3 interest from $19 = $22, which is good enough. If I spend discards fishing for a King, I might get another $5 (Mail-In Rebate), increasing the amount, but there is a risk of not finding it.\n\nI confirm I can reach 819 chips: [30 (Three of a Kind)] + 33 (Aces) for 63 chips, and the Joker (Mail-In Rebate) for 13 multiplier, meaning 63 * 13 = 819. Playing the debuffed Spades cards (Q and 9) won't contribute, and the 10 of Hearts won't affect the hand type.\n\nThe description says \"Mail-In Rebate\" rank changes every *round*. Given this and previous observation, it is King.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate action is to:\n\nAction: \"play\"\nPositions: [3, 5, 8]\nIntended Hand: \"three of a kind\"\nEstimated Chips: 819\n\n\n"
