{"reasoning":"**My Current Game State Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's take stock. I'm at Ante 3, Round 4, just finished the Small Blind, and in the Shop phase. I've got $14 to play with. My Joker setup is looking pretty good: Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, Scholar, and DNA. I'm holding The Magician consumable and the Telescope voucher.\n\nThe plan is to scale and get chips to beat Ante 8. DNA + Scholar is a powerful combination, especially if I can duplicate Aces. Telescope will trigger with a Celestial Pack due to High Card and Three of a Kind currently having the same number of plays.\n\nI've got a couple of choices here. I could buy the Lusty Joker, but I don't really need it, or the Buffoon Pack. Right now the Celestial Pack at position 2 is the most appealing to use the Telescope voucher. Hieroglyph would take me back to Ante 2, which is useful, but it costs $10 and reduces the number of hands I can play.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my thinking: Celestial Pack is a must. It's only $4. It gives me a shot at Pluto (High Card) or Venus (Three of a Kind). Both are valuable in my setup. I can afford Hieroglyph ($10). That would put my balance at $0. This resets interest, but it effectively buys me more time (three rounds) to scale DNA and Ride the Bus, find more aces, and potentially find more scaling. With my current set up, I believe this is worth it.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with the Celestial Pack first. I've confirmed that the inventory for consumables is not full. And I have enough money. The only action available in the shop is to buy the booster.\n\nFinal action: `buy_booster 2`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
