{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Poker Hand and Optimizing for Victory**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Small blind, need 11,000 chips, currently at 6,562, and only three hands left.  The goal is straightforward: maximize the score this round and ideally set up for the next. The DNA card is foil, adding 50 chips, but Brainstorm is currently copying that uselessly. Blue Joker is a straight 118 chip boost, Mail-In Rebate gives +10 mult and cash for Ace discards, and Ride the Bus provides +18 mult which resets on a face card. I have “The Empress” consumable.\n\nMy hand is decent: a mix of multis, the King of Clubs (a face card!), Steel, and Stone. The immediate priority is to get Brainstorm working and get rid of that King. Since I don't want to reset \"Ride the Bus\", I *must* play it carefully. My first instinct is to rearrange the jokers to optimize their abilities, especially Brainstorm copying Blue Joker.\n\nLet's do the initial calculation: High Card gives around 55 base chips and 6 mult, plus 50 from the Stone, and 50 from the Foil DNA. And then 236 from the copied Blue Joker. That's a total of 391 chips. Then, 10 mult from Mail-In Rebate and 18 from Ride the Bus for 34 mult. My Steel card gives another 51 mult. That's almost 20,000 chips. And, that doesn’t take into account my Tarot generators.\n\nThe goal is 4,438 using remaining hands without resetting \"Ride the Bus\".\n\nOkay, now let's think. The Empress! I can use the Empress to enhance two cards. However, I have discard cards that will generate tarot cards which are also enhancements. So, I shouldn’t use The Empress.\n\nSo, let's just win the hand and then set the stage. The \"standard\" move here is Joker rearrangement. This round, discarding the King of Clubs before playing is a high priority.\n\nThe plan: First, I’m rearranging the Jokers. No point in delaying that. Next, I'll discard two cards: the King of Clubs to avoid the \"Ride the Bus\" reset and the 9 of Spades to get a Tarot card, and then play my strongest high card - the Stone card - for a massive score this round. And...wait, the prompt wants just one action: `rearrange_jokers 3 2 1 4 5`.\n\nSo the action is: `rearrange_jokers 3 2 1 4 5`\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [3,2,1,4,5]"}
