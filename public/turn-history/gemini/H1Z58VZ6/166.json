{"reasoning":"**Current Round Strategy: Maximize Scaling and Value**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. We're in Ante 5, Round 15. The current blind is small, at 11,000 chips. The \"Boss Tag\" is tempting, but there's a boss called \"The Needle\" with a requirement of 11,000 chips, which is unusually low for this late into the game, but that's what the state tells me. With my current build, I can easily surpass this, so skipping is pointless. I can use the boss tag if the requirement gets too high.\n\nMy hand setup is solid. I have \"Ride the Bus\" and \"Brainstorm\" copying for +23 Mult each, \"Blue Joker\" for a chip boost, \"DNA\" to duplicate cards (ideally Steel), and \"Steel Joker\" for a passive X2 Mult and X1.5 multiplier while it's in my hand. That's a good combo for single-card plays.\n\nCurrently, playing a single High Card is Level 6, and is worth 55 chips, and 6 mult. I'll need to use DNA to grab more steel cards.\n\nMy core strategy is clear: I want to scale \"Ride the Bus\" by playing non-face cards, and boost my Steel cards via DNA. Each round is a chance to do that, and gain money, for shop opportunities.\n\nMy current chips potential is around 257 Chips * 52 Mult * 2 * 1.5 = ~40,000. Easily exceeding the 11,000 chip requirement.\n\nI've got $39, and the interest is capped at $5 ($25 balance). The small blind gives $3 as a reward.\n\nI should play the round to scale \"Ride the Bus\" (which is going to get stronger with non-face hands), use \"DNA\" (to create more steel cards), and continue building my money. I can beat the boss easily.\n\nConsumables won't do me much good right now since I can't target cards, and I am not in a round.\n\nThe Joker arrangement is optimal with \"Steel Joker\" at the end for maximum effect. I had to double-check \"Steel Joker\". It usually provides a passive X0.2 mult per Steel card, but it does say X1.5 while it's held in hand. Regardless, that's still a multiplier, and optimal at the end.\n\nTherefore, the action is `play_round`.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
