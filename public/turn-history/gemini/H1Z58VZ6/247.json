{"reasoning":"**Strategic Reroll in Ante 7**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7, Round 21, with $40 in the bank. The next blind is coming up, and my immediate goal is to hit the chip threshold and scale for Ante 8. My core strategy is High Card (currently level 13) amplified by the DNA + Brainstorm combo to spam Steel cards, which in turn scale my Steel Joker (currently at X2.8 mult), plus Ride the Bus for additive mult (+31) and Blue Joker for chips (+170).\n\nRight now, my setup is: DNA (foil, leftmost), Brainstorm, Steel Joker, Ride the Bus, and Blue Joker. The Moon and Devious Joker are useless for this strategy. I've got no boosters or vouchers left, except Telescope that really makes Celestial packs (Pluto) useful. I just bought Blank, so I am out of vouchers.\n\nI have $40, which keeps me at max interest of $5. The reroll cost is $5. The question is, should I reroll? I'm looking for Standard Packs (Steel cards), Tarot packs (Steel enhancement), Celestial packs (Pluto for High Card), or better Jokers. Rerolling is cheap, and I'm currently at $40, so it's a very safe move.\n\nIs there a need to rearrange Jokers right now? No, Brainstorm is perfectly positioned to copy DNA in the first hand. After that, I can move it to copy Steel Joker or Blue Joker as needed *during* the round, so DNA/Brainstorm prep is correct in the shop.\n\nThe current shop items are not helpful, and I am not able to afford anything that helps me currently. Rerolling drops me to $35, but I'll still get max interest. So that's still fine.\n\nAt this stage, finding more Steel cards or High Card levels is vital to scale for Ante 8. The Tower tarot card? It's tempting for a Stone card, but Stone doesn't synergize as well as Steel, and I will save the Tower or sell it if I need space for a better tarot. Round Select? I could just proceed, but searching for scaling is usually better in Ante 7.\n\n$40 is a healthy amount, and one reroll at $5 is very safe.\n\nThe prompt says to analyze and take an appropriate action. If I reroll, I could find a Celestial Pack (High Card) or a Standard Pack (Steel card). Actually, let's refocus on the strategy. High Card level 13 is good, but more is better. Steel cards are the main scaling.\n\nIf I don't reroll, I save money for future shops. I am using my Telescope voucher to increase value of Celestial packs, which are the main pack I am trying to get. However, with the DNA + Brainstorm engine, the chances of getting good cards on the next ante are high.\n\nLet's look at the options.\n\n*   `reroll_shop` is $5.\n*   The interest cap is $25, giving me $5, and the money at $35 still provides that max interest.\n*   **Decision:** Reroll.\n\n*   `action`: \"reroll\\_shop\"\n*   Wait, is there any other better move?\n*   `round_select` is also viable, but searching for scaling is usually better in Ante 7.\n*   Is `sell_consumable` or `use_consumable` needed? No.\n*   I will proceed with `reroll_shop`.\n\nI should make sure that I am looking for the best play, I have the Telescope voucher, which means Celestial Packs are very valuable. So rerolling to find one is high value.\n\n**Action: `reroll_shop`.**\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
