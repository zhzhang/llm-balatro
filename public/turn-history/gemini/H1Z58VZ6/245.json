{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Round 21 Decision**\n\nOkay, so we're at Ante 7/8, Round 21. Current game state: Jumbo Standard Pack, $47 in the bank. Got a decent Joker setup: DNA (foil), Brainstorm, Steel Joker (X2.6), Ride the Bus (+31), and Blue Joker (+168). Inventory's got The Tower (1/2 slots), ready to go when I need it. My build strategy is High Card (Level 13) with a focus on a DNA/Brainstorm loop for card duplication. The Steel Joker is my powerhouse here, scaling off Steel cards in the deck, currently sitting at X2.6. And of course, Ride the Bus is going to be helpful as I need to get as much mult as possible from non-face cards.\n\nNow, looking at the choices:\n\n*   Choice 1 & 2: 7 of Clubs (Base)\n*   Choice 3: 10 of Diamonds (Base)\n*   Choice 4: 5 of Clubs (Steel Card enhancement)\n*   Choice 5: King of Clubs (Lucky Card enhancement)\n\nThe goal here is simple: maximize score potential for this Ante. Keeping in mind the DNA/Brainstorm synergy, I need cards that I can duplicate for value. The Steel Joker, as I said, gets a significant mult boost from Steel cards in the deck, and is the key to my build. Ride the Bus is reliant on non-face cards being played to get mult, I always want this to score as it's such a strong mult effect.\n\nSo, let's break down the choices in more detail:\n\n*   Choice 4, the Steel 5 of Clubs, is looking like the clear winner. Immediately, it boosts the Steel Joker mult by X0.2 (X2.6 -> X2.8). Even better, this can be duplicated by DNA/Brainstorm next round, adding *two* more Steel cards per round. Plus, the 5 of Clubs, being a non-face card, won't reset Ride the Bus if it scores.\n*   Choice 5, the Lucky King of Clubs is less appealing. It's a face card, so it will reset the Ride the Bus mult if played and scored. And Lucky effects are always RNG-based, so I can't rely on it. It also doesn't fit the Steel Joker strategy, which is the cornerstone of my current build.\n\nTherefore, it's a no-brainer. I'm selecting the Steel 5 of Clubs. The action is `select 4`. No positional arguments needed, as it's a standard pack.\n\nNo reason to skip, no reason to sell a joker. I have full joker slots and am not buying a joker. There's no reason to use The Tower right now.\n\nAction: `select`\nPosition: `[4]`\nThe obvious choice is the Steel 5 of Clubs. Time to optimize!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
