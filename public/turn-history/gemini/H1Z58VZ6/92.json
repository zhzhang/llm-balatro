{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy for Ante 10**\n\nOkay, here's the game state: Ante 10, Shop phase, $24 in the bank. I've got a decent Joker setup: DNA for card copying, Brainstorm to double the DNA, Blue Joker for a hefty chip boost, Mail-In Rebate for flat mult and cash from 3s, and Ride the Bus for non-face card mult. High Card is the primary hand I'm using, level 5.\n\nI'm eyeing the shop. I see `Walkie Talkie`, which looks intriguing, but I need to make sure this is actually a good purchase. The `Walkie Talkie` would provide 10 chips and +4 Mult for each 10 or 4 played. I have several 10s and 4s. However, `Blue Joker` provides a flat 128 chips; `Walkie Talkie` isn't going to get close to that, so that's not getting sold. It looks like `Ride the Bus` and `Mail-In Rebate` are also better for a single card play.\n\nBut, the `Arcana Pack` is worth a look. I'm going to take a shot, for $3, because Clearance Sale will make it that cheap, and I can open it to see if I can improve the deck. Maybe I'll get some tarot cards to manipulate the deck.\n\nI'm going to purchase the `Arcana Pack` now, it's the best option here. After the purchase, I'll have $21. My interest will still be $4, so I'm not losing anything. I will buy now.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
