{"reasoning":"**Current Optimization Thoughts**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in Ante 2, Round 2. I've got $20 and a *Mail-In Rebate (Holo)* joker that’s giving me +10 Mult, plus $5 for discarded 3s. That's a good start. I also have some other options: *Square Joker* for chip scaling if I play exactly 4 cards, and *Ride the Bus* for more mult if I can avoid face cards. I've also got some shop boosters: a *Mega Standard Pack* and a *Celestial Pack*. The *Telescope* voucher, which shows me the most played hand, is available.\n\nLet's break this down. The *Telescope* is $10. It’s a significant long-term investment. Buying it now will make the *Celestial Pack*s much more valuable, because my most played hand is Three of a Kind. The *Celestial Pack* is only $4. The *Mega Standard Pack* is $8.\n\nI'm thinking I should buy the *Telescope* first because it gives a big permanent buff. That means the *Celestial Packs* will include Mars. Since I already have a scaling +10 Mult joker, a scaling mult joker is my next priority, so *Ride the Bus* might be strong. I can buy multiple things. I have $20, so I can afford some of this now. I will have $0 if I buy everything.\n\nThe interest cap is $5, so I can get $4 interest.\n\nMy plan is: Buy the *Telescope* first, and then the *Celestial Pack*. Should I get *Ride the Bus* for more mult, or save my money and take the interest? I'm already pretty strong, so I'm not desperate to get *Ride the Bus*. I'll buy *Telescope* and *Celestial Pack* first. I have to choose *one* action at a time, so I'll buy the *Telescope*.\n\nAction: `buy_voucher 1` (Telescope)\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
