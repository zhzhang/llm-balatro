{"reasoning":"**Shop Phase Optimization: High Card Focus**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 6, Round 19, Shop phase. I've got $45, and my current build is looking pretty solid. My focus is still on leveraging High Card, which is currently at level 10, producing 95 chips and 10 multiplier.\n\nLet's break down my Joker situation: I have Steel Joker (x2.2), Brainstorm which is currently copying Steel, Ride the Bus (+27 Mult), DNA (Foil, +50 chips), and Blue Joker (+160 chips). My hand is at 5/5, so I am set. I don't need any consumables at this point. I have a great collection of Vouchers that will help me scale this engine, and the shop currently holds a Green Joker and an Acrobat.\n\n*   *Green Joker*: This isn't that good for this strategy, at +1 Mult per hand, but -1 per discard. Since I already have Ride the Bus, it isn't worth the slot.\n*   *Acrobat*: It provides x3 Mult on the *final hand* of the round. While a decent Joker, this isn't optimal when my strategy is to 1-shot rounds.\n\nSo, the cost to reroll the shop is $5, and the best play here is to gamble on finding either a Tarot, Celestial, or Spectral pack. These packs are the standard high-level play when I have excess cash and a solid engine. I had just bought and used a Pluto pack and a Standard pack (picking 7 of Spades with Blue Seal). This means the 7 of Spades (Blue Seal) will create a Pluto card every round I play it as the last hand, which is great for High Card scaling.\n\nWith my current engine, I'm estimating about 54,619 chips per High Card, which should be sufficient for the round. The big blind is 45,000, and I should be able to 1-shot it.\n\nTherefore, I will **reroll_shop**.\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
