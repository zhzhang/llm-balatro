{"reasoning":"**Alright, let's break this down. The current situation demands strategic thinking. I'm in the Big Blind with a hefty 7500 chips needed to survive. I've got a decent hand, some powerful Jokers, and a few consumables, including *Death* and *Temperance*. The goal is clear: hit that chip target within the next three hands, all while building a strong foundation for future rounds.**\n\nFirst, *Temperance* is screaming to be used for an immediate $12 boost, so let's get that money flowing. I'm prioritizing getting those additional Steel Kings. *Death* seems like the key, but I need to use it intelligently to clone the King of Hearts. It needs to copy the card on the left to the card on the right, which means I have to rearrange the cards in my hand *before* I use the consumable. I'll need to move the Queen of Hearts (pos 4) to the left of the King of Hearts (pos 3).\n\nSo, the game plan is:\n\n1.  Use *Temperance* for the quick cash.\n2.  Rearrange the hand so the Queen is on the left of the King.\n3.  Then, use *Death* to clone the King.\n4.  Finally, play the hand.\n\nBut, hold on. I'm getting ahead of myself, I can win this hand if I want to and just focus on accumulating chips, but if I want to max out, I have to take into consideration the best future moves.\n\nFor now, I'm just going to focus on using *Temperance* to get the cash. And then I can proceed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"use_consumable\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
