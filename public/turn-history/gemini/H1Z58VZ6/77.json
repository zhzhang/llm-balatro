{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis - Round 8**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Ante is 3/8, we're in the BLIND_SELECT phase. The current blind is **The Wheel** - confirmed, it's the one where 1 in 7 cards get drawn face down. We need 4000 chips to clear this.\n\nMy Joker setup is pretty sweet: DNA (1), Brainstorm (2) copying DNA, Blue Joker (3), Mail-In Rebate (4) for +10 mult, and Ride the Bus (5) for +9 mult. We also have a Death consumable, but I don't see any need to use it. Money is a paltry $19, but that's not our focus now. Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale - nice, future potential. Hand level is High Card Level 4, at 35 chips and 4 mult.\n\nThe Boss Blind is inescapable, so we just have to play to win. The `play_round` command is our only option, which is exactly what we need to see. No need to sell anything either. My Joker positions are perfectly optimized for that DNA/Brainstorm combo, so DNA gets the card from the played hand, then Brainstorm copies it twice. So, that's three copies of a card in total.\n\nBase mult is around 23 excluding card values, plus Blue Joker gives us +118 chips. We need to hit 4000 chips, so it's all about maximizing our High Card play to get there.\n\nThe action is `play_round`, which is our only option. Our hand type is set to High Card, and the chip count is to be determined. So, I need to see what we can do with this hand, hopefully, it's enough to hit 4000! Let's get this done.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
