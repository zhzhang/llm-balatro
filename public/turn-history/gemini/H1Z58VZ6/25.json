{"reasoning":"**Strategic Optimization: Skipping the Celestial Pack**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm inside the Jumbo Celestial Pack (`PLANET_PACK`) with a clear objective: maximize my score and money to conquer Ante 3 and beyond. I've got a decent hand, with $7 in the bank. My Joker lineup is pretty solid, but I see an opportunity to make it even stronger. Right now, I'm holding Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Red Card, Blue Joker, and Scholar. I am at maximum Joker capacity.\n\nMy primary strategy revolves around Three of a Kind, as evidenced by my Hand Level progression and the Telescope voucher. I've got a Jumbo Celestial pack to consider, with Venus (Three of a Kind, +2 Mult, +20 Chips), Earth, Neptune, Saturn, and Mercury available.\n\nHowever, remembering my previous reasoning and looking at the Red Card, I realize I need to *skip* the pack to trigger the crucial +3 Mult bonus on that Joker. I'm choosing to activate that joker. The Red Card is currently at 0 Mult, but it's crucial I don't overlook it, because it is the strongest option currently. The Venus card offers a good buff to my Three of a Kind, but ultimately, the global +3 Mult from the Red Card is more impactful in the long run.\n\nThe core of my plan is to skip the booster pack to trigger Red Card. Since this is an explicit choice I planned out, that means the best thing to do is to go through with that. Now I will formulate the command.\n\nI need to confirm the schema for this action is still correct. It is `{\"action\": \"skip_booster\"}`. This is a valid JSON object, adheres to all the requirements. So, my final action: `skip_booster`.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
