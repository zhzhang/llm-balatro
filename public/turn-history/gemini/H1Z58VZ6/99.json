{"reasoning":"**My immediate objective is clear: to efficiently progress through this round and secure the necessary chips, while maximizing my resources.**  I'm in Round 11, with a Big Blind of 7500 and a current chip count of 4843.  I need to gain 2657 chips over the next three hands, and I have four discards available.\n\nMy hand analysis reveals a strong opportunity: I have three 10 of Diamonds, which are wild cards that create Tarot cards when discarded. I currently have no consumables but can hold two. My strategy is to discard two of these 10s to fill my consumable slots with Tarot cards, which might provide valuable advantages.  I have two discard slots, so I'll discard positions 2 and 3, which hold 10s.\n\nI have a few critical jokers to consider, as well.  The \"Ride the Bus\" joker is especially enticing, with +14 Mult, gaining +1 mult per non-face card hand, so I can try to maximize this multiplier. The \"Blue Joker\" provides +112 chips, and the \"Mail-In Rebate\" joker gives +10 mult and is Holo. I also have the \"Steel\" modifier on my King.\n\nMy initial calculation suggests I can easily generate the necessary chips with a High Card hand. However, I want to keep all options open for a potentially higher score by using Tarots.\n\nWhile considering joker arrangements, the task is to identify the next *action*, and discarding is the most immediately beneficial. Rearranging Jokers can be done later, and generating Tarots is a priority.\n\nBased on previous turns, the current hand is a result of consumables being used previously. So my hand is, King (Steel), 10 (Wild/Tarot), 10 (Wild/Tarot), Ace, Queen, 7 (Mult), 8, 4, 10 (Wild/Tarot).\n\nTherefore, my clear action is to **discard** cards in positions **2** and **3**.  This action sets me up with two consumable Tarot cards, which I can use to improve the round further. Discarding any more cards is not necessary to win.\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3]"}
