{"reasoning":"**Shop Analysis and Decision-Making**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 4/8, Round 9, and I'm in the SHOP phase. I've got $17. My High Card strategy is solid with a level 5 High Card and a great Joker setup: DNA, Brainstorm (2), Blue Joker (3) for chips, and Mail-In Rebate + Ride the Bus for Mult. I'm using DNA and Brainstorm to duplicate cards which is key.\n\nMy initial thoughts are: *To Do List* (+50 chips) isn't worth it; Blue Joker already crushes that. *Saturn* for Straights is useless here. The *Standard Pack* is tempting, especially since it's only $3 thanks to Clearance Sale. It could contain a valuable card (Enhancement/Edition) that I could duplicate with DNA. I could also keep the money. However, I’ve used most of the great items this shop had to offer.\n\nI've already snagged the Grabber and used the Jumbo Celestial Pack. So the Standard Pack seems like the only remaining thing to consider. Reroll is at $5. I could move on to the next round, get more money and use DNA. I will re-examine the shop.\n\nDNA at position 1 and Brainstorm at position 2 is key for maximum card duplication. I need to make sure I am in that order. I have to confirm that Brainstorm is compatible with DNA, which it is.\n\nWith $17, I could buy the Standard Pack for $3, leaving me with $14 ($2 interest). Is that Standard Pack worth a $1 difference in interest? Probably. It might contain a Steel, Gold, or Glass card and is worth it in Balatro.\n\nThen, there is the *To Do List* which provides +50 chips. It is not worth replacing Mail-In Rebate and losing +10 mult for +50 chips.\n\nThe *Standard Pack* seems like the best move. I need to check the JSON format:\n`{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`\n\nBefore I finalize that, I'll go back and check Turn 82. The AI purchased the Jumbo Celestial Pack in the previous turn. In Turn 83, it selected Pluto.\n\nSo, this turn, I am weighing: *To Do List*, *Saturn*, *Standard Pack* for $17. The *Standard Pack* is the best option.\n\n**My Decision:** I'm going to buy the Standard Pack.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
