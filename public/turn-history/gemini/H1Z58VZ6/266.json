{"reasoning":"**Shopping Phase Analysis: Celestial Pack Prioritized**\n\nOkay, so it's Ante 7, Round 23, and I'm prepping for that boss blind. I've got $39, which is a decent starting point. The goal is to maximize my points for the upcoming blind, and I've got a solid foundation with my current Jokers: DNA (Foil), Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, and Blue Joker. I'm also holding The Tower and Justice consumables, which I should keep in mind for future rounds.\n\nMy primary strategy is High Card, currently at level 14, and I'm leaning heavily on that. With the Telescope voucher, a Celestial Pack is almost guaranteed to give me a Planet card, specifically Pluto (High Card) and I know it's a good investment. The Clearance Sale voucher is keeping the cost down to just $3. I can easily afford it.\n\nThe Credit Card is not needed because I have enough money, and the Ceremonial Dagger is not needed either because I don't want to destroy my valuable Jokers.\n\nThe Standard Pack is also cheap ($3). It might offer a Steel card which scales Steel Joker. My Steel Joker is currently at X3.2 Mult. It increases by X0.2 for each Steel card in the deck. This means there are (3.2 - 1.0) / 0.2 = 11 Steel cards currently in the deck. The DNA/Brainstorm combo is already adding cards to the deck.\n\nI'm confident in my Joker order: DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, and Blue Joker. Brainstorm copying DNA is good for early deckbuilding, and Ride the Bus before Steel Joker optimizes the mult scaling.\n\nThe immediate priority, though, is leveling up that High Card. The Celestial Pack is the clear choice here. I have $39, so after the purchase, I'll still have plenty for rerolls or other shop actions, and I'll still get max interest.\n\nTherefore, the action will be to buy the Celestial Pack: `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
