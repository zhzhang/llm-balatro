{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. Ante 5, Round 12. I've got $28, enough for a single reroll. My jokers are DNA, Brainstorm (copying DNA), Blue Joker (+144 Chips), Mail-In Rebate (+10 Mult, Holo), and Ride the Bus (+17 Mult). Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. The strategy is High Card (Level 6).\n\nLooking at the shop, the `Runner` card (+15 Chips for Straights) is useless given my strategy. `Credit Card` is also a no-go; I have enough cash, and I need to stay above the $25 interest threshold to maximize passive income.\n\nA reroll costs $6, which would leave me with $22, dipping below that interest mark. Right now, I'm earning $5 interest (20% of $25), which I don't want to lose.\n\nI've already bought the booster pack this shop cycle. The current shop cards are unhelpful. My High Card scoring is decent, but not a powerhouse.\n\nSo, is there anything else I can do? Rearrange jokers? Brainstorm is correctly positioned to copy DNA at the start of the round; I'll move it to copy Blue Joker or Ride the Bus during the hand play to get extra score.\n\nThe `Telescope` Voucher *could* get me a Planet pack, which would be high value. However, the interest loss outweighs the potential gain, given the shop's current offers.\n\nTherefore, the best action here is `round_select` to maintain that sweet interest income. I'm going to lock in that move.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
