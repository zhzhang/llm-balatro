{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Phase Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 6, round 15, and I've got $50 to spend in the shop. My High Card strategy is at level 5, thanks to \"The Arm\" dropping it twice, which means I need to optimize what I can buy. I've got a strong Joker lineup: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and DNA. Two consumables, The Empress and The Moon, are taking up space. Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Director's Cut, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. The goal is to maximize my score, typically between 30,000-40,000 to win, given that I'm playing High Card. My current Hand Level of 5 needs an immediate boost.\n\n*   **The Breakdown:** My Jokers provide a substantial multiplier (Ride the Bus + Brainstorm: +46, Mail-In Rebate +10, total +56) and chips (Blue Joker +152, DNA +50, total +202). A standard non-face High Card now scores approximately 15,000. It's time to build a strategy.\n*   **The Options:** I'm considering:\n    *   *Strength Tarot ($2):* Useful but not crucial.\n    *   *Walkie Talkie Joker ($3):* Could replace weaker cards, especially with 15 Tens.\n    *   *Celestial Pack ($3):* MUST buy. The description confirms it will contain Pluto, which will restore my High Card level. This is non-negotiable.\n    *   *Buffoon Pack ($3):* A potential Joker upgrade, but my current lineup is synergistic, as DNA benefits the Blue Joker.\n    *   *Petroglyph Voucher ($7):* This is the real gem: -1 Ante, which would buy me time to scale. My current deck has been hurt by two drops from \"The Arm\".\n\n*   **The Decision:** First priority, I will buy the Celestial Pack to recover levels and build my high card. I can then use the contents immediately. Since it costs $3 and I have $50, I'm okay. After that, I will immediately buy the Petroglyph to drop the ante to 5 and give myself time.\n*   **The Action:** I must use the valid JSON schema for the buy booster: `{\"action\": \"buy_booster\", \"positions\": [1]}`. Let's do it!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
