{"reasoning":"**Making the Optimal Play: Selecting Pluto**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 7/8, Round 23, I'm in a PLANET_PACK. Got $36, and some solid Jokers: DNA (foil), Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Steel Joker, and Blue Joker. Telescope and Clearance Sale vouchers are active. My strategy is all about that High Card, which I've played 32 times and is now Level 14. This Celestial Pack offers me Pluto (High Card level-up), Venus (Three of a Kind level-up), and Saturn (Straight level-up).\n\nGiven my Joker setup, Pluto is the clear choice. The Telescope voucher guarantees its presence, so I'm leveling up my primary scoring hand. Pluto will boost High Card to Level 15, adding +10 Chips and +1 Mult. I have a very strong hand, and this will continue to build on that.\n\nNow, the JSON command. It has to be perfect, no comments, and strictly follow the schema. It's a \"select\" action, and I'm selecting the first option, Pluto. The `positions` will be `[1]`. The other fields, `intended_hand_type` and `estimated_chips`, are irrelevant in this phase, so I'll set them to `null` to comply with the schema's specifications.\n\nLet's do a final check: Action: \"select\", Positions: \\[1], intended_hand_type: null, estimated_chips: null.\n\nThe resulting JSON will be: `{\"action\":\"select\",\"positions\":[1],\"intended_hand_type\":null,\"estimated_chips\":null}`. That should be a valid action for the game.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
