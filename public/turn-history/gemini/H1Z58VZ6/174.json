{"reasoning":"**Current Decision: Planet Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the planet pack selection stage. The goal, as always, is to maximize my high card value. I've got a solid high card level 7 already, with a decent base chip and multiplier. The Jokers I'm holding are key: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm (a copy of Ride the Bus!), a Blue Joker for chips, DNA (foil!) for more chips, and Steel Joker for a multiplier boost. Not a bad hand at all. I've also got $46 to spend.\n\nThe choices are clear-cut: Pluto for high card, Mars for Four of a Kind, or Neptune for Straight Flush. Easy. The voucher, the Telescope, practically screams Pluto anyway, because I always use high card.\n\nPluto is the obvious play here. It directly levels up my intended high card strategy. Mars and Neptune are distractions, irrelevant for this strategy.\n\nSo, I'm going to *select* Pluto. That's position 1. No target cards are needed here, as it's just a planet card.\n\nNow I need to construct the JSON. The prompt wants \"select <pack\\_card\\_position>\". Okay, Pluto is at position 1. The schema wants \"action\", \"positions\", \"intended\\_hand\\_type\", and \"estimated\\_chips.\"\n\nWait, should I specify `intended_hand_type` as null or high card? It's kind of both. Since I'm selecting the planet card, not playing a hand, `null` is the safer option. I'll stick with that for now, and check the past output for consistency. Yep, the previous turn used `null`.\n\nLet's build the JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"select\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\nOkay, the JSON is valid, double-quoted, no comments, no control tokens, single object. This is going to be a straightforward turn. No need to overthink it. Pluto it is, and the JSON is ready. Time to level up that High Card!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
