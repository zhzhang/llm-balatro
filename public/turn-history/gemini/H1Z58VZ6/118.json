{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Decisions**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop, Ante 5, Round 12. I've got $43, and my primary objective is to maximize my scoring potential for this ante and the ones to come. My current build is a High Card strategy, currently level 6. I'm using the Blue Joker for chips and Ride the Bus/Mail-In Rebate for Mult. DNA and Brainstorm are for deck manipulation and card copying, which is a powerful combo.\n\nLet's break down the options. I see Crazy Joker, Clever Joker, Jumbo Standard Pack, and Mega Standard Pack, along with the option to Reroll. Given my strategy, both Jokers are useless, so they are out of the question.\n\nI have no vouchers left, as I had previously spent my points on the Director's Cut voucher.\n\nI'm sitting at $43. The ideal scenario is to stay above $25 to maximize interest ($5). I could spend up to $18 and still hit that cap next round, since I will be earning money from the blind.\n\nSince I have the Telescope voucher, a Celestial Pack will always have the Pluto card, which is critical for High Card scaling. So, that's top priority in the long game. However, I have to think about this specific round and the current deck. Standard Packs *could* give me cards for DNA to copy, especially Aces for Mail-In Rebate.\n\nBut here's the interesting part. The Blue Joker gives me +2 Chips *per card in the deck*. Currently it's giving +138 chips. 138/2 = 69, which is interesting since the deck size is 50 in the round context. Adding more cards *actually helps* the Blue Joker's chip bonus! It's a sweet synergy.\n\nSo, the play here is clear. Step 1: I'm buying the Mega Standard Pack for $6. I know it only gives 2 cards, but I need Aces for Mail-In Rebate, and any card with a good seal (Red/Purple) to use with DNA.\n\nMy current money: $43 - $6 = $37. Still comfortably above the interest cap.\n\nWhy not reroll first? Because the packs are already here, and they offer high value for my DNA/Blue Joker synergy!\nSo I will select to buy the Mega Standard Pack to improve the deck and also find cards to copy with DNA, since it synergizes with the Blue Joker by increasing deck size.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
