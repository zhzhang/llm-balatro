{"reasoning":"**My Turn to Discard**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 3/8, Round 8, and I'm in the SELECTING\\_HAND stage. The Big Blind is looming, requiring 3000 chips, and I'm currently at zero. I have $14 and three hands remaining. I've got two discards left, which is crucial. My goal? Snag that elusive Purple Seal 10 of Diamonds. I've got a couple of powerful Jokers: DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate and Ride the Bus.\n\nMy hand right now is: Ace of Spades, 5 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 4 of Diamonds, 4 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds. No dice on the 10 of Diamonds, unfortunately. No Jacks either, so no immediate Mail-In Rebate value. And since I haven't played a hand yet this round, Ride the Bus is irrelevant for now. The deck has a healthy 39 cards remaining, meaning the 10 of Diamonds should be lurking in there.\n\nThe game plan is simple: maximize my chances of finding the 10 of Diamonds. I've got two discards and three hands. Since DNA copies the first played card, I need to make that card the 10 of Diamonds to be copied by Brainstorm. I'm going to discard the five cards that are *not* the 10 of Diamonds. With 8 cards, I need to discard the irrelevant cards, which are: Ace of Spades, 5 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs, and 5 of Clubs. That leaves me with the 4 of Diamonds x2 and 2 of Diamonds.\n\nThere's no point in keeping the 4s as my focus is that 10 of Diamonds. It's time to discard. My intention is to set up a situation where my first hand contains only the 10 of Diamonds, so I must discard the aforementioned 5 cards.\n\nNow, before I commit, let's verify everything. Ride the Bus doesn't matter yet. I haven't played any hands in this round. DNA will trigger on the *first played* hand if it only contains 1 card. The target card is probably in the deck. I'm discarding 1-5, which are AS, 5H, 4H, 10C, and 5C. I'm double checking my previous analysis, because I need to get this right. Everything looks good.\n\nTherefore, the action is \"discard\", and the positions are \\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"discard\", \"positions\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
