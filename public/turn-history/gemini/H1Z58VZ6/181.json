{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Card Pack**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 5, Round 17. Shop phase, standard pack. I've got $53. My Jokers are: Ride the Bus (avoiding face cards for mult), Brainstorm (copying Ride the Bus, so even more incentive to avoid face cards), Blue Joker (+ chips based on deck size), DNA (foil that duplicates a single-card play), and Steel Joker (X2 mult, grows based on Steel cards). I also have The Moon consumable, which I may use later to get some Clubs. My hand is High Card, which is already at Level 9 and scores well, but is still vulnerable to The Needle boss.\n\nI've got five cards to choose from: 7 of Clubs, 10 of Spades, Jack of Hearts (Red Seal, Retrigger 1 time), Jack of Spades, and 4 of Clubs. Since Ride the Bus is the cornerstone of this build, the face cards (Jack of Hearts, Jack of Spades) are immediate no-gos. I want to prioritize non-face cards, and Steel cards for Steel Joker.\n\nOkay, so I have the 7 of Clubs, the 10 of Spades, and the 4 of Clubs. None of these have any inherent advantage in terms of scoring, but as the 10 of Spades has a higher chip value, there is some advantage there. Since the Needle boss needs 11k, a 10 can help, but I'm currently far above 11k.\n\nNow, wait a second. I'm already easily winning this, so I can think long-term here, and I don't see any Steel cards in the choices, so I need to keep looking. Plus, I have DNA; I can duplicate a card if I find something better, but I'm not seeing anything immediately valuable. There's a Red Card in the shop, but it triggers on *skipping* packs, but since I haven't *bought* it yet, skipping wouldn't do anything for it. I should choose a card.\n\nBacking up for a moment to re-evaluate the previous turn's intent... I was intending to look for Steel cards or cards to copy. These are not Steel cards. So, if I pick a card, what does that do? It adds a card to my deck, which *increases* the Blue Joker's bonus, which is a good thing.\n\nTherefore, the choice is between 7, 10, or 4 of clubs. None break Ride the Bus, so I can pick any of them. But, since the 10 of Spades has the highest chip value, I choose that.\n\n**The Decision**\n\nThe Jack of Hearts is a Red Seal, it's powerful, but it would break Ride the Bus. I still want a safe choice. Plus, the previous turn, the shop options were Red Card and High Priestess, which I still haven't bought. I can go back to the shop after the selection, so I will select the 10 of Spades. If I skip, I gain nothing. If I pick a card, I get +1 card in deck, which is +2 chips for Blue Joker.\n\nNo real reason to take the 4 or the 7. Let's go with the 10 of Spades. I re-check the \"select\" schema and ensure I'm only sending the pack position.\n\nSo, final check:\n\n*   Joker 1: Ride the Bus (Avoid face cards)\n*   Joker 2: Brainstorm (Copying Ride the Bus)\n*   Joker 3: Blue Joker (More cards = more chips)\n*   Joker 4: DNA (Copy card)\n*   Joker 5: Steel Joker (X mult)\n\nSelecting 10 of Spades (Pos 2):\n\n*   Non-face card.\n*   +2 chips for Blue Joker.\n*   No negative impact.\n\nAction: \"select\", Positions: \\[2].\n\nOkay, I'm confident. Let's make the selection!\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
