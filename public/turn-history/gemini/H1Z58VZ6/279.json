{"reasoning":"**Strategic Endgame Assessment: Ante 8, Round 24**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the endgame, Ante 8, with $37. My High Card strategy is holding steady, focusing on non-face cards for maximum \"Ride the Bus\" multiplier. Currently, I have a solid joker setup: DNA, Brainstorm (copying DNA), Ride the Bus (+34 Mult), Steel Joker (X3.4), and Blue Joker (+186 Chips). \"The Tower\" consumable is ready to go, just in case I am forced to play a face card. Also, \"Planet Merchant\" voucher is available.\n\nLooking at the shop, both Midas Mask and Shoot the Moon are immediate no-gos – they actively work against my no-face-card strategy. I'm also thinking \"Planet Merchant\" could be very useful, and it's relatively cheap at $7, especially considering I also have \"Telescope\". It will increase the frequency of Planet cards which always contain Pluto (High Card).\n\nMy immediate goal is to beat the final Boss of this Ante, so I must maximize my scoring potential this round. That means I need to make the most of my jokers.\n\nBrainstorm is currently copying DNA. While this is helpful for deck-building, in this critical moment, I need maximum multipliers. I can use the DNA/Brainstorm combo to copy either Ride the Bus or Steel Joker, and I also need to make sure I find useful cards in the shop.\n\nSo, let's look at the plan. I've got $37 and I should buy \"Planet Merchant\". Since I'm also at the end of Ante 8, it makes the most sense to buy the voucher for $7 and then I'll have $30 left over. Then, I should reroll the shop to find better jokers or useful cards.\n\nI *should* buy \"Planet Merchant\". It's the only logical move right now. It's cheap and increases the chance of seeing Pluto cards. Afterwards, I will reroll to improve the selection.\n\nTherefore, the action is: `buy_voucher 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
