{"reasoning":"**Analysis of Shop and Decision to Advance**\n\nOkay, here we are, Ante 5, Round 14. Time to assess the shop. I've got $35, which is decent, and a pretty solid Joker setup. Ride the Bus and Brainstorm are my primary multipliers, and Mail-In Rebate is giving me money, so this is solid. The Blue Joker gives a good chip boost, and DNA provides another chip boost and hand copying. My consumables are just taking up space right now. I've got a selection of Vouchers, but none are immediately game-changing. I am very confident with my hand.\n\nThe shop offers a Photograph, but that's anti-synergistic with Ride the Bus, so I can cross that off immediately. Rocket is interesting, scaling economy, but I'm already generating decent income, with the interest rate being capped at $5 given my current money. The Empress and The Moon are using up space, but they aren't worth the money.\n\nLet's look at the numbers: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm and Mail-In Rebate give a whopping +52 Multi. Blue Joker and DNA give +200 chips. Even with a base High Card at Level 7, I'm easily looking at around 15,635 chips per hand. The Boss Blind, \"The Arm\", needs 30,000. So I can beat this blind no problem. The hand will be reduced each level, but even if it dropped to level 5, I'd still have plenty of scoring potential.\n\nSo, the shop itself... Photograph is a no-go. Rocket is okay, but I'd have to sell DNA or a joker. I've finished using the Tarot pack. The shop isn't offering anything essential. I could reroll, but I'm content with my current setup. \n\nThe most logical move is `round_select` to move on. No specific positions needed. I'm ready to take on the Boss.\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
