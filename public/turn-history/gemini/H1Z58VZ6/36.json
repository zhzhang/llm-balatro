{"reasoning":"**Strategic Celestial Pack Selection**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in a `PLANET_PACK` step after buying a Celestial Pack, and the Telescope voucher is active. I see that High Card and Three of a Kind are tied for the most played hands so far, with two plays each. My booster pack options are Venus (Three of a Kind), Jupiter (Flush), and Mercury (Pair).\n\nLooking at my Jokers, I've got Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, Scholar, and DNA. Ride the Bus is screaming to be used, rewarding hands without face cards, and High Card and Three of a Kind are both easy to play without face cards. The Scholar is the obvious play here, as DNA will help me with Aces. Venus is the perfect card for this situation, and leveling up Three of a Kind to give it more mult and chips is a smart move right now. Pluto (High Card) isn't being offered here anyway. I'm going to ignore Jupiter (Flush) and Mercury (Pair) since they don't really synergize as well with the DNA/Scholar strategy.\n\nSo, the play is clear. I'm selecting Venus, which is in position 1, to boost Three of a Kind. That means the intended hand type is \"three of a kind.\" I don't need to specify estimated chips.\n\nThe action is \"select\", and the positions are just [1]. Done.\n\nDecision: `{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [1], \"intended_hand_type\": \"three of a kind\"}`\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
