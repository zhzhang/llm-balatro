{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Ante 4, Round 9. I've got $14 to work with. My inventory is looking pretty decent with a nice set of Jokers: DNA (Rare, key to my whole strategy), Brainstorm (Rare, the perfect copycat for DNA), Blue Joker for chips, Mail-In Rebate for money, and Ride the Bus for Multiplier. I've also got a Death consumable and some useful Vouchers: Hieroglyph, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale.\n\nMy core strategy revolves around High Card, currently at Level 5. My main engine relies on DNA and Brainstorm: play a single card, double it immediately.\n\nNow, the pack options:\n\n1.  Jack of Hearts (+10 chips, a face card). The face card will reset Ride the Bus.\n2.  2 of Spades (+2 chips, a low card).\n3.  7 of Hearts (+7 chips, +4 Mult, Mult Enhancement).\n\nThe first two cards are irrelevant. It's the 7 of Hearts with the Mult Enhancement that really shines. *This* is the objective best choice here. It's not a face card (so Ride the Bus is safe), and it gives me a multiplier boost right off the bat. The real kicker is the Mult Enhancement. Duplicating this card with DNA and Brainstorm is going to be incredibly powerful. A High Card with multiple +4 Mult cards? That's going to build up some serious scoring potential.\n\nSo, the optimal play is definitely to select the 7 of Hearts. No doubt. The final action will be to select this card, and it has no target.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"select\", \"positions\": [3]}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
