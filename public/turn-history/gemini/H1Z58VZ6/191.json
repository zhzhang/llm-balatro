{"reasoning":"**Prioritizing the Needle: A Shop Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: Ante 5, and I'm staring down \"The Needle,\" the dreaded Boss Blind. Single hand only – gotta make it count. My immediate goal is to maximize my High Card score and surpass the expected 50k-60k threshold for this stage. I've got a decent Joker setup: DNA, Brainstorm, Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, and the all-important Steel Joker.  I've got $26 in my pocket, which gives me some flexibility in the shop.\n\nThe shop itself presents a Vagabond and a Juggler. Both are pretty useless here. Vagabond is for low-money builds, and Juggler is hand size, but I'm full. No need. I need raw scoring power, fast. \n\nThe strategy is clear. I want to build around Steel Joker and have Brainstorm copy it. The plan is to get an X4 multiplier – a doubled Steel Joker multiplied by the original – and push for a huge score, likely around 90k. So, I must ensure that Steel Joker is in the leftmost position, which Brainstorm copies. This means I've got to swap the Jokers around for the boss. \n\nNow, I'm at the shop, but the previous turn's (191) intent was to reroll one more time, then rearrange the Jokers. So the next step is a reroll. \n\nOkay, now for the crucial decision. I've got $26 and a reroll costs $9. I'll have $17 left. Given the plan, I should go for it. A reroll might bring me something incredible, like a Pluto card (Celestial Pack) which gets multiplied by the Telescope Voucher. A great bonus.\n\nReroll first, then decide whether to buy something, then rearrange, then proceed to the next round. So, let's execute the reroll!\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
