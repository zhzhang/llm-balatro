{"reasoning":"**My Strategic Analysis: Ante 4 Shop - Prioritizing the Spectral Pack**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm in Ante 4, Round 10. I've got $27, and I'm looking to optimize my setup for the Big Blind and Boss Blind. My current Joker lineup is pretty solid: `DNA`, `Brainstorm`, `Blue Joker` (a hefty +128 chips!), `Mail-In Rebate` (a Holo +10 mult and economy card), and `Ride the Bus` (a scaling +13 mult). I also have two consumables: `Death` and `The Chariot`.\n\nIn the shop, I'm seeing: `To Do List`, `Walkie Talkie`, a `Spectral Pack`, and an `Arcana Pack`. I've also got some useful Vouchers – `Hieroglyph`, `Grabber`, `Telescope`, and `Clearance Sale`. My objective is to strengthen my hand for the coming blinds.\n\nMy initial thought is the `Walkie Talkie`, which gives +10 chips and +4 mult for each 10 or 4 played. This would be fantastic given my focus on 10s (Purple Seal Wild Cards). The `Blue Joker` is a big chunk of chips, but I know that long term, multipliers are more important. However, the `Walkie Talkie` would mean selling a Joker, probably `Blue Joker` eventually or the `Mail-In Rebate`.\n\nHowever, before I make any decisions about swapping out Jokers, I know the meta and should open the booster packs first. Spectral packs are rare and often game-changing. With `Clearance Sale`, both the `Spectral Pack` and `Arcana Pack` are only $3. Given my powerful engine with `DNA` and `Brainstorm`, I think a \"Immolate,\" \"Ankh,\" or \"Wraith\" Joker from the Spectral pack could significantly alter the game. I think my current boosters are the way to go.\n\nSo, the first thing I'll do is buy the `Spectral Pack`. I double-checked the command syntax to be sure. It's `buy_booster`, and the position is 1 in the shop booster slot.\n\nTherefore, my final JSON command will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
