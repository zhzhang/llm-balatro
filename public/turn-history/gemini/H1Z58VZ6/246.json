{"reasoning":"**Shop Strategy: Ante 7, Round 21 - Building the Engine**\n\nOkay, so we're in SHOP phase, Ante 7, Round 21. Got $47, five Jokers, a consumable, and a few vouchers. The immediate goal is to keep scaling my High Card strategy, focusing on building out the Steel Joker. DNA and Brainstorm are the key engine here; they create extra Steel cards. Let's see... I've got a foil DNA (+50 chips on the first card, copies), Brainstorm (copies the leftmost Joker, DNA), Steel Joker (X2.8 Mult per Steel card), Ride the Bus (+31 Mult), and Blue Joker (+170 Chips).\n\nThe shop's offering *The Moon* (Clubs Tarot), which doesn't fit the build. *Devious Joker* for Straights is also useless here. Then there is the *Blank* Voucher, which costs $7 and, 10 purchases gets me the Antimatter voucher. That's a solid long-term play, and it's the right move to make at this point. I have to stay focused on scaling up, so I should ignore these other two cards. Reroll is $5. Money is more important than a reroll.\n\nI'm thinking about Joker positioning. Brainstorm should be positioned to copy DNA to create more steel cards, but *when* scoring, I need to copy the *best* Joker. DNA's a good source of chips, but Steel Joker is my primary multiplier and Ride the Bus provides solid Mult. I still need to get enough Steel cards in my deck to utilize this build properly, so Brainstorm will copy the first card I put out. It's the right choice.\n\nThe *Tower* consumable enhances to *Stone*. It doesn't help Steel Joker, so I'll save it for a later use or if I need to remove a card.\n\nNow, that *Blank* Voucher is the play here. Investing in that to get the Antimatter Joker slot is a solid long-term play. It's a standard Balatro move, and I'll use it.\n\nGiven I have $47, I'll buy *Blank* now. Then, I can consider a reroll. I have $40 after buying the *Blank*, so I will not reroll. $35 is well above the interest cap. The next most effective move is *Blank*.\n\nSo, the action is to buy Voucher #1: Blank. Buying Blank moves toward the *Antimatter* Voucher and gives me a longer-term edge.\n\nOkay, let's execute that plan.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
