{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Current State and Formulating a Strategy**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Ante 5/8, $61 in the bank, and the goal is to absolutely obliterate The Needle boss with a single, high-scoring hand. Considering the current hand, a High Card strategy at Level 8, I'm already comfortably exceeding the required 11,000 chips – last hand was over 30,000.  The Joker lineup is solid: Ride the Bus, Brainstorm (copying Ride the Bus), Blue Joker, DNA (a foil!), and the Steel Joker. I've also got The Moon consumable in the inventory (which isn't useful for this run).  My Vouchers are also strong.\n\nNow, looking at the shop, the first immediate choice is between a Red Card, The High Priestess, and the two booster packs.  I've got a Telescope voucher, which guarantees a planet for my most played hand in Celestial packs (High Card).  The initial plan is clear: **buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack first**.  It's a no-brainer with Telescope, potentially boosting High Card's base stats and leveling it up. It will add a Pluto card to boost High Card’s chips and mult.\n\nThe next thought is to snag The High Priestess, as it creates two random Planet cards. After that, I'll see if a Jumbo Standard Pack is worthwhile (for potential Steel cards to maximize the Steel Joker). Then, I’ll reroll the shop if needed.\n\nThe question of whether to buy and use the High Priestess immediately is on my mind. If I buy the Celestial Pack first, it uses the first consumable slot. The High Priestess goes into inventory for later use. I have to prioritize the Celestial Pack. It's a direct, guaranteed upgrade with Pluto, and I'll still have a slot for the High Priestess. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is the better and the correct play. Let's make that purchase. I am very confident of the outcome.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [1],\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
