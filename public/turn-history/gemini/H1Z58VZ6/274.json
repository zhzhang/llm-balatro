{"reasoning":"**Strategic Shop Analysis: Ante 8, Boss Defeated**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I've just wrapped up the boss in Round 24 and I'm in the shop for the final Ante, Ante 8. I've got $46 to work with, a solid Joker setup: DNA (Foil), Brainstorm, Ride the Bus (+34 Mult), Steel Joker (X3.4), and Blue Joker (+184 Chips). I also have The Tower consumable. My hand level for High Card is at 15 (145/15), which is my main scoring focus.\n\nNow, the shop options: Midas Mask ($5), Shoot the Moon (Foil, $5), a Standard Pack ($3), a Mega Celestial Pack ($6), and a Planet Merchant Voucher ($7).\n\nThe Jokers I'm running are: DNA copies cards, Brainstorm copies DNA, Ride the Bus gives Mult (and resets on face cards, which I'm avoiding, so the resets aren't an issue), Steel Joker gives X3.4 Mult based on Steel cards (I think I need 17 for that), and Blue Joker gives Chips.\n\nMidas Mask is useless to me right now, given my build. Shoot the Moon is okay, and I could sell a Joker for it, but I don't think it's worth it. A standard pack *might* give me more Steel cards to buff the Steel Joker, and it's cheap. The Celestial Pack is the real prize here because I can select two Planets, and since High Card is my most played hand, the Telescope voucher guarantees a Pluto card. Finally, the Planet Merchant voucher will help me get more Plutos, but perhaps not in time for this round.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to max this round. High Card is at Level 15, and the voucher gives us the Pluto card. A Mega Celestial Pack is a direct, cheap ($6), upgrade to the scoring engine. Also, the Planet Merchant Voucher is good long-term. Finally, the standard pack might give more steel cards.\n\nMy immediate focus is on the Mega Celestial Pack. I need to get this, no question. The Telescope voucher guarantees Pluto and I get to pick two Planets. This is a no-brainer.\n\nI'm double-checking the figures: I have $46, the pack costs $6. The Telescope voucher guarantees Pluto.\n\nOkay, let's execute. I need to buy the Mega Celestial Pack.\n\nTherefore, my action is: `buy_booster 2`\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
