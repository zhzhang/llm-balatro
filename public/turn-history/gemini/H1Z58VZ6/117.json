{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Ante and Planning the Shop Phase**\n\nAlright, Ante 5, Round 12. This is where things get interesting. Last time, it was Boss Blind - I beat it, and now I'm here. Shop phase. I've got $50, which is the interest cap, so that's good. My Jokers are DNA, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate (now Holo Ace!), and Ride the Bus. My Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Grabber, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. The shop offers Crazy Joker, Clever Joker, Jumbo and Mega Standard Packs, and Director's Cut.\n\nDNA is the star here; I can use it to build a strong deck by copying specific cards like 10s or Aces, especially since my Mail-In Rebate is now an Ace. Brainstorm can copy DNA, but in a round, it will copy either Blue Joker or Ride the Bus. Blue Joker is a reliable source of chips, Ride the Bus gives consistent Mult, and Mail-In Rebate is a money generator. Crazy Joker and Clever Joker are useless for a High Card build. Director's Cut could be a good failsafe, rerolling a problematic Boss Blind. The Standard Packs are tempting, but adding cards can be a double-edged sword unless I get something I really need.\n\nI'm at the interest cap, so that's great. Clearance Sale makes things cheaper, and the Telescope is active, meaning Celestial Packs will offer Pluto cards (Planets) for my most played hand: High Card. I should be looking for Celestial Packs.\n\nThe shop, however, is not offering Celestial Packs, unfortunately. Standard packs might have useful cards, but they also risk cluttering the deck. Director's Cut is a good insurance plan if I get a bad Boss Blind, but right now I need to improve my deck or find better Jokers or Planets. I'll open Standard Packs to see if there are any good cards to copy with DNA, particularly Aces.\n\nDo I buy Director's Cut? It is cheap insurance, or should I buy Standard Packs? Reroll? I want to find Celestial Packs (Pluto) to level up High Card further. With $50, buying Director's Cut ($7) leaves $43. The Standard Packs would cost $10 total, leaving $33. Reroll would cost $5, leaving $28.\n\nRight, the shop isn't ideal for High Card. I need to find those Pluto cards. It's a priority to find Celestial Packs. But let's buy Director's Cut first, for the voucher benefit.\n\nWait, I have the option of deck improvement or better Jokers. However, I have a pretty strong High Card setup with Chips from Blue Joker, Mult from Ride the Bus, and Money from Mail-In Rebate, as well as the ability to copy with Brainstorm. Buying the Standard Packs -- Jumbo ($4) and Mega ($6) -- might be better than rerolling immediately.\n\nThe Voucher is safer.\n\nHowever, let's consider the Standard Packs. DNA is the key. If I find a Red or Purple Seal card, that's huge.\n\nLet me check the shop again: Crazy Joker, Clever Joker, Jumbo Standard, and Mega Standard.\n\nBuying Mega Standard first might be best, but let's go with the Voucher: Director's Cut first.\n\nLet me check my money. $50. Director's Cut is $7. It's safe to buy the voucher for now, and I'll still get max interest. The Jokers are bad. The packs are \"Standard\" -- this build prefers fewer, better cards, or specific ranks.\n\nBuying the Voucher.\n\nAny better options? No.\n\nAction: `buy_voucher`, positions: \\[1].\n\nLet's double check. Director's Cut is a permanent voucher benefit. Jumbo and Mega Standard Packs are the shop boosters. Okay, buying the voucher.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
