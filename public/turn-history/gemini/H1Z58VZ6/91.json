{"reasoning":"**Current Assessment of Spectral Pack Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm in the SPECTRAL_PACK phase. I'm on round 10, ante 4/8, and sitting on $24, which is decent for interest. My Joker setup is pretty solid: DNA, Brainstorm (copying DNA, crucial synergy), a Blue Joker for chips, Mail-In Rebate (Holo and +10 Mult, great for economy), and Ride the Bus (+13 Mult, decent scaling). I also have two consumables, Death and The Chariot, but they're not relevant here.\n\nThe pack gives me two choices: Wraith (random Rare Joker, sets money to $0) or Hex (Polychrome random Joker, destroy all others). There's also the option to skip.\n\nHex is an immediate \"no.\" Losing DNA and Brainstorm, which are *critical* for this build, for a *chance* at a Polychrome Joker is a terrible trade. A complete disaster.\n\nWraith is tempting, as Rare Jokers can be game-changing (Blueprint, Baron, etc.) I would have to sell a Joker to make room, as I have a full Joker board. I'd also lose all my money, a significant hit at $24. I'd be trading money and a Joker for a *random* Rare. The command list lets me `sell_joker`\n\nI have to assess the value of selling a Joker versus keeping it. Selling the Blue Joker is very tempting, but the chips are crucial in the early game. Selling Ride the Bus would significantly reduce scaling. But there's also the chance of a horrible rare, like The Trio or something else not conducive to the deck.\n\nDNA and Brainstorm are my engines right now. I'm in a very strong position. Risking $24 and a Joker slot for a random Rare is probably a negative expected value play.\n\nSkipping the pack feels like the most sensible play. I'd lose $3, but I maintain the $24 (and thus interest income) and my powerful DNA/Brainstorm synergy.\n\nI can't use consumables to make room; I'm at the max already.\n\nLet's rethink Wraith. Let's imagine I sell the Blue Joker, then use Wraith. I'd have DNA, Brainstorm, Mail-In Rebate, Ride the Bus, and a random Rare. Is that really better than keeping $24 and the chips? Probably not. The interest alone is likely better than the risk of getting a \"bad\" Rare.\n\nHex is definitely out.\n\nThe right action here is `skip_booster`. Both options are very expensive given my strong current setup.\n\nI am checking the available commands; `skip_booster` is listed. I'm going to skip this. I will keep the $24 and my existing Joker synergy, and keep playing.\n\n\n","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
