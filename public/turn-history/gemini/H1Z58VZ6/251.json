{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop and Planning the Next Move**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Round 22, Ante 7/8. I've got $46 to work with, and my hand is a High Card build. I've got a solid setup with DNA, Brainstorm, Steel Joker (x3.2), Ride the Bus (+32), and Blue Joker (+174). My High Card is at level 13, and I've got a Tower consumable. I also have some powerful vouchers: Hieroglyph, Blank, Director's Cut, Grabber, Paint Brush, Petroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. The last hand got me 51,410 chips – easily surpassing the Small Blind of 35,000. The Big Blind is now 52,500.\n\nLooking at the shop, I see a Runner and Earth card, but they're not useful for my High Card strategy, so I'll ignore those. I have two booster options: an Arcana Pack and a Celestial Pack, both priced at $3. The Telescope voucher is active, which guarantees a Pluto card (High Card) in every Celestial Pack, given that High Card is my most played hand. The Clearance Sale further reduces the Celestial Pack to $3. This is a very efficient play. I can also get the Arcana Pack, with the possibility of useful Tarot cards like The Chariot (Steel), Death, Temperance, The Hermit, or The Fool.\n\nMy Steel Joker is currently at x3.2, and DNA and Brainstorm are correctly positioned to double the deck-building effect on the first hand.\n\nMy plan is straightforward:\n\n1.  **First, buy and use the Celestial Pack.** The Telescope guarantees a Pluto card, which will level up my High Card. This is the most consistent scaling for my build.\n2.  **Second, buy the Arcana Pack.** I'm hoping for The Chariot or cards that can manipulate the deck, although I'm less sure of the value here.\n\nI have enough money ($46) to buy both booster packs, and I have Telescope active to guarantee the most important card (Pluto) for my build.\n\nNow, to generate the appropriate JSON. The schema requires `action` and `positions`. I need to buy the Celestial Pack first.\n\nBased on the schema, I want to execute the action `buy_booster` with position `2` which is the Celestial Pack. Then I will execute `buy_booster` with position `1`, the Arcana Pack.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation again I am ready.\n\nI will start by purchasing the Celestial Pack.\n\n**JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"buy_booster\",\n  \"positions\": [2]\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
