{"reasoning":"**My Turn in the Shop**\n\nOkay, Ante 8, Round 24. Shop phase. I've got $40, and I need to make some strategic decisions. Let's see, my hand currently consists of:\n\n*   DNA (Rare, Foil): Love this one. Adds a copy of the first card played in the hand.\n*   Brainstorm (Rare): Duplicates my leftmost joker, currently DNA. Nice synergy.\n*   Ride the Bus (Common): This is the key. No face cards. That's the core of my current High Card engine.\n*   Steel Joker (Uncommon): This is where things get interesting. It's got a base multiplier based on the number of Steel cards in my deck, and a *secondary* multiplier while it's in hand. This Steel Joker text seems specific, maybe a unique edition? It's currently at X3.4 multiplier, which means I have 17 Steel cards in the deck. It's a solid multiplier card.\n*   Blue Joker (Common): Adds chips based on the total number of cards in my deck. It's at +184 chips, which implies I have 92 cards in the deck.\n\nI've got one Stone card, The Tower, and a bunch of Vouchers: Hieroglyph, Blank, Director's Cut, Grabber, Paint Brush, Petroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. Hand levels are currently High Card Lvl 16 (155/16).\n\nNow, the shop:\n\n*   `Midas Mask` is useless to me. It's bad for my non-face card strategy.\n*   `Shoot the Moon` also a no-go for the same reason.\n*   `Standard Pack` for $3 is worth considering. I need to keep the deck going for Ride the Bus.\n*   `Planet Merchant Voucher` for $7. Increases Pluto frequency; could be good for future Ante runs.\n\nGiven my money, I'm thinking the `Planet Merchant` for future Pluto card collection could be useful (though it's Ante 8, so the window is closing). But let's be strategic and check that `Standard Pack` first. I really want to find more Steel cards to boost Steel Joker.\n\nSo, the plan: I have $40, and $3 is a good investment.\n\n*   I'll buy the `Standard Pack`. This fits my strategy, providing me with more cards for Blue Joker and potential Steel cards to boost Steel Joker. And, yes, it is affordable.\n*   Action: `buy_booster 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
