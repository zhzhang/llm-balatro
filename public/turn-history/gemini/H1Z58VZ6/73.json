{"reasoning":"**Planet Pack Strategy: Pluto Acquisition**\n\nAlright, I'm in the `PLANET_PACK` phase after opening that Celestial Pack. My goal, as always, is to absolutely maximize my score and crush Ante 8. The current strategy is a High Card build, which is a solid foundation, especially with the Jokers I've got. Let's see, I've got Telescope to guarantee the planet for my most played hand, Clearance Sale for discounts, DNA for a first-hand copy, Brainstorm to copy the leftmost Joker, the Blue Joker for chips, Mail-In Rebate for multi/money, and Ride the Bus for non-face card multipliers.\n\nMy most-played hand is High Card, which makes Pluto the obvious choice here. The Telescope is doing its job and has correctly placed Pluto, which is perfect. Picking Pluto will level up High Card to level 3, granting me an additional +1 Mult and +10 Chips.\n\nSo, the action is `select` and the position is 1, Pluto. No cards are needed for this selection. The command I'm sending is `select 1`. Let's get this done. Since I am building High Card, the `intended_hand_type` is obviously \"high card\". The `estimated_chips` is null because scoring doesn't happen during the shop/booster phase, but it will certainly affect future scoring! The JSON structure requires `action`, `positions`, `intended_hand_type`, and `estimated_chips` fields, and the `action` is \"select\", the `positions` is `[1]`, the `intended_hand_type` is \"high card\", and `estimated_chips` is `null`. All looks good. I am happy with this.\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
