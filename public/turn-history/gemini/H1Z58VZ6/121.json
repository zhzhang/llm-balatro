{"reasoning":"**Analyzing the Shop in Round 12**\n\nOkay, so I'm in Ante 5/8, Round 12 of this game. My current money sits at $37, and the goal is still to push through to the 8th boss round. I'm sticking with my High Card strategy, currently at Level 6. My Joker lineup is: DNA (copying the first hand if it's a single card, which is the whole strategy), Brainstorm (copying the leftmost Joker, currently DNA, which is perfect), Blue Joker (+142 chips from my current deck of cards), Mail-In Rebate (+10 mult, earning $5 for discarded Aces), and Ride the Bus (+17 mult, gaining +1 per hand without a face card). My Vouchers are Hieroglyph (-1 Ante cost), Director's Cut (reroll the boss), Grabber (+1 hand), Telescope (Celestial Packs always have most played planet), and Clearance Sale (25% off).\n\nIn the shop, the cards on offer are Crazy Joker (+12 Mult for Straights) and Clever Joker (+80 Chips for Two Pair). Neither is useful for High Card. My boosters are a Jumbo Standard Pack, which I'm very interested in (I've been loading up my deck). The reroll cost is $5.\n\nI've just added two new cards to the deck: a 9 of Spades and a 7 of Hearts, both Purple Seals. The Blue Joker's bonus went up from +138 to +142, which is consistent with the +2 chips per card effect. That means I've added two cards, which is what I saw. This brings me to the core question: what to buy and do in the shop? I want to hit that interest cap of $25.\n\nMy strategy revolves around leveling up High Card, mostly through Pluto cards and stacking Mult and Chips. Telescope makes Celestial Packs particularly appealing.\n\nI'm thinking about the Jumbo Standard Pack. I could use more Purple Seals, Blue Seals, or even Aces for Mail-In Rebate. And it also adds to the deck size, which is critical for that Blue Joker. Given my $37, I have more than enough money. I’m thinking I can afford the pack. The cost is only $4.\n\nThen, there's the possibility of rerolling the shop ($5), but I am not seeing that as particularly beneficial. I'm hoping for a celestial pack or maybe a more useful joker. The other options are to proceed to the next round. The Jumbo pack seems like the better option. I already bought the mega pack last round.\n\nNow, buying the Jumbo Standard Pack is a good idea. Adding cards is a good move for Blue Joker, and getting specific cards for DNA duplication is critical for success. With $37, I will still stay above $25 ($37 - $4 = $33). So, action: `buy_booster 1` (Jumbo Standard Pack). I'll execute that buy immediately. I should double-check my Joker placement; DNA and Brainstorm are in the optimal spots to copy. I think I'm set!\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
