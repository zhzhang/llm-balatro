{"reasoning":"**Endgame Shop Decision: Reroll for Maximum Power**\n\nOkay, Ante 8, Round 24. We're in the endgame now; gotta make every dollar count. I've got $30 and the reroll cost is $5. Jokers are pretty solid: DNA (Foil), Brainstorm (Copying DNA), Ride the Bus (+34 Mult), Steel Joker (X3.4), and Blue Joker (+186 Chips). I also have The Tower consumable, Planet Merchant voucher (just bought), and Telescope voucher (for guaranteed Pluto in Celestial Packs, which are currently unavailable). My hand is High Card at Level 16 – perfect for the current setup with no face cards.\n\nThe shop offers Midas Mask and Shoot the Moon – both are useless, maybe even detrimental, considering my \"Ride the Bus\" strategy. I've already bought the voucher. My plan is High Card, no face cards; maximizing the Steel card count with the DNA, Brainstorm, and Steel Joker is the priority. The Blue Joker is my chip generator and Ride the Bus is the additive multiplier.\n\nSo, the shop cards are no good, and there are no booster packs. My money is at $30, and the reroll cost is $5. My goal is to find more Steel cards, a Planet Pack (for Pluto), or maybe a better Joker, though the current setup is strong.\n\nI have two options here: reroll the shop or exit and proceed. With $30, multiple rerolls are possible. Currently, Brainstorm is copying DNA on the leftmost slot. This is fine for the *first* hand of each round, to generate two copies. During scoring hands, Brainstorm should be copying one of the multipliers (Ride the Bus or Steel Joker). However, since I'm in the Shop, I need to decide if I want to reroll or leave.\n\nThe shop cards are undesirable, and there are no packs. Rerolling could give me a Celestial Pack, which the Telescope voucher will guarantee Pluto. Otherwise, I might get a Tarot/Standard pack and more steel cards. Ante 8 is the endgame; maximizing power *right now* is the key.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable action is to `reroll_shop`. The cost is $5, leaving me with $25. I won't be `buy_card` as those cards are not helpful. I already bought the voucher. The Tower needs a card in the *current* hand to be useful. Reroll is best.\n\nSo, I will reroll to get a Planet Pack or a boost before the final boss.\n\nI will `reroll_shop`.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"reroll_shop\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
