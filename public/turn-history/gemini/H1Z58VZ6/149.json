{"reasoning":"**Analysis and Action: Securing the Win**\n\nOkay, so here's the situation: Big Blind of Ante 5/8, goal is 16,500 chips, I'm currently at 8,496, and I have three hands left.  I've got a decent hand - a couple of Aces, some 10s, 8s, and a 5. Plus a pile of Jokers. Let's see... DNA is useless for this turn, but Brainstorm is currently copying its now-useless ability. Ride the Bus is the key to maximizing my mult. I need to get Ride the Bus into the leftmost position so Brainstorm can copy its effect, +20 mult. Mail-In Rebate is adding +10 mult and the blue joker adds ~120 chips which helps a lot. I also want to keep the Gold Aces in my hand for that sweet $6 at the end of the round. So, the first step is definitely re-arranging the Jokers.\n\nOkay, so the Joker order *needs* to be Ride the Bus, Brainstorm, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, DNA. That will give Ride the Bus's +20 mult to Brainstorm.\n\nNow, let's look at the hand. I can play a high card, like a 10 (not a face card, to keep Ride the Bus active, and not the Gold Aces). My calculations show that a High Card (I'll play the 10) plus the Jokers will generate around 13,160 chips and that will easily push me over the 16,500 threshold. In fact, playing a Lucky Ace (even better because it has a 1-in-5 for +20 mult) works too, if I want to keep the gold aces in my hand. Ride the Bus will still go to +21 mult.\n\nMail-In Rebate's ability is to earn $5 for discarding 7s. But I don't need any 7s.\n\nI have The Empress consumable in my hand, but I can't think of anything better to do with it than save it for the next round. No need to overcomplicate things. Plus, saving the consumable for the shop is important.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy here is straightforward: Rearrange the Jokers and then play one of the high cards or a Lucky Ace to clear the blind. There's no need to take any risks or overthink things.\n\nNow, let's perform the rearrange and end this hand:\n`{\"action\": \"rearrange_jokers\", \"positions\": [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]}`\n\n\n","action":"\"rearrange_jokers\"\nPositions: [5,2,3,4,1]"}
