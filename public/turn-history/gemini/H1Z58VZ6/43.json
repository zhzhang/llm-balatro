{"reasoning":"**Strategic Analysis for Ante 2: A Calculated Pass**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I'm in the shop (step: SHOP) with a meager $2. The goal is to maximize my current hand and prepare for the next round. My Joker lineup is solid: Mail-In Rebate (holo, +10 Mult), Ride the Bus (+4 Mult), Blue Joker (+106 Chips), Scholar (Aces give +20 Chips, +4 Mult), and DNA (copy a card in the first hand). I also have The Magician consumable and the Hieroglyph voucher active (-1 Ante, -1 hand).\n\nI'm initially considering my shop options, but with only $2, I'm priced out of everything immediately. I can't afford the Buffoon Pack, Faceless Joker, or the Gift Card. Selling The Magician ($1) wouldn't help. Selling a Joker is the only possibility to buy something from the shop.\n\nI'm carefully weighing which Joker to sacrifice. Selling Mail-In Rebate for the Gift Card is out of the question since it's Holo. Selling DNA for a Gift Card is tempting, but DNA's deck-building power synergizes with Scholar's Ace focus. Losing DNA would be a critical blow to my long-term strategy, and the Gift Card's slow return isn't worth it at this stage. I've already used my Arcana pack.\n\nI've determined that the best course of action is to stick to the plan: Advance to the next round, leverage the existing Jokers, and work towards getting the Scholar and DNA engine going. I'll save The Magician for a future hand where it can amplify valuable cards (especially Aces).\n\nI also realized I need to check my remaining cash after the fact of selling The Magician ($1) and it will get me no closer to being able to afford anything. I've been selling the benefits of the interest from one round to the next, which is not optimal.\n\nI've reconsidered selling for Gift Card. I've made the decision to keep DNA.\n\nI need to confirm if there are any \"must-do\" actions.\n\nI can rearrange Jokers. Since all my Mult is additive, the order doesn't affect the final score. However, I want DNA to be first, Mail-In Rebate second, Ride the Bus third, Scholar fourth, and Blue Joker last for additive Mult.\n\nI'm ready to move to the round select screen. I need to note that I have a \"Hieroglyph\" active which is -1 to Ante and -1 to hand size.\n\nA quick review of the game's state reveals a critical detail: The current boss is \"The Window,\" which debuffs Diamond cards. I have Diamond cards in my hand (9 of Diamonds, 4 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds) from the previous blind and also Aces. My strategy is to avoid playing the Diamond Aces.\n\nI must keep The Magician for use during the round.\n\nUltimately, I have no money and need to advance to the next round, so I'm skipping this shop. I'll submit the `round_select` command.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\"\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
