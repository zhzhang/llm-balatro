{"reasoning":"**The Hieroglyph Gambit: A Play for the Long Game**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. I've got $10, a decent Joker setup – Mail-In Rebate (that sweet +10 Mult!), Ride the Bus for scaling Mult on non-face hands, Blue Joker generating chips, Scholar for Ace synergy, and DNA ready to clone Aces. The goal is Ante 8, and I'm itching to build something *big*.\n\nI'm staring down the Shop, specifically at the Hieroglyph voucher for $10. It reduces the Ante by one, and hand count by one. The key is to evaluate it as a tool for a specific build.\n\nPros: 3 extra rounds (for a total of 9 total Anthes) of shop visits for scaling DNA (cloning Aces), Ride the Bus (+Mult). Plus more money from shop refreshes.\n\nCons: Losing one hand per round. Could hurt scoring safety and money from remaining hands.\n\nI have zero dollars after purchase. This means one turn without interest. But, think of the long game. DNA and Ride the Bus are going to shine.\n\nOkay, let's assess the current Joker order. Right now, it's Mail-In Rebate (holo), Ride the Bus, Blue Joker, Scholar, DNA. This is right. Blue Joker's flat chip value doesn't care about xMult positioning.\n\nOkay, I'm sold. The Hieroglyph is the play. It's a risk, but the long-term potential is huge. Time to execute.\n\n`buy_voucher 1`.\n\n\n","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
