{"reasoning":"**My Calculated Play: Round 7 - The DNA Shuffle**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 3/8, Big Blind, $9 in the pot... I need 3000 chips to clear this. This round is critical for scaling up my Ride the Bus joker, which is currently at +7 multiplier, and also for leveraging that DNA/Brainstorm combo I've got going. \n\nI've got a solid joker setup: DNA on the left, which copies the first card played in a hand, and Brainstorm right next to it, which copies *that* first card. Plus, I have Blue Joker with a sweet +114 chip boost, and a Mail-In Rebate giving a static +10 multiplier. Ride the Bus is the key though: no face cards! I *have* to play cards, and ideally, all non-face cards, to get that multiplier growing.\n\nI'm staring down the barrel of a Boss Blind, where 1 in 7 cards will be face down. Annoying, but manageable with my planned High Card strategy. That strategy is boosted to lvl 2, meaning 15 chips and 2 mult. The Boss Tag I have is tempting as a reroll, but honestly, this boss is doable. The payout for winning is $4 and Interest, so $5 total.\n\nThe *real* opportunity here is to use my deck manipulation. I've got a 10 of Diamonds Purple Seal Wild card in the deck and I **need** to get it out. Playing a single card (10 of Diamonds) at the start of the round will *instantly* create two copies, thanks to DNA and Brainstorm! Perfect. This is a no-brainer.\n\nSkipping the round is just not an option. It kills the Ride the Bus scaling, prevents the deck manipulation, and also denies me access to the shop, which is never a good idea. Plus, a new reroll would not guarantee a better boss to face.\n\nThe task is asking for a JSON action object, and it's clear what I have to do. The available commands are there, but I need to `play_round`. So, that's what I'm doing.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
