{"reasoning":"**Current Game State Analysis and Decision**\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. It's Ante 3/8, Round 6, I'm in the Shop phase, and I'm flat broke – $0 to my name. My inventory is looking like this: I've got DNA and Brainstorm (a great combo, as Brainstorm copies DNA), a Blue Joker for some chips, Mail-In Rebate for multi, and Ride the Bus for multi. I also have a few vouchers, but they don't help me here. The shop is tempting with those packs, but it's all out of reach with my current funds.\n\nMy immediate goal is to hit the chips threshold for this round. I can't buy anything in the shop, I can't reroll, and I can't sell anything either. I already rearranged my jokers in the previous step, so the order is optimal for my current hand: DNA (1), Brainstorm (2), Blue Joker (3), Mail-In Rebate (4), and Ride the Bus (5). The shop offers no help, and I have no consumables to play.\n\nGiven that I have no cash, the shop is useless, and my jokers are set up as well as I can, the only logical step is to select the next round. My DNA/Brainstorm combo is going to be my workhorse, copying the first card I play. Then, I have the chip bonus from the Blue Joker to help me with my hand. I'll get 10 multi from Mail-In Rebate. I'll get a further 5 multi from Ride the Bus (if no face cards score).\n\nGiven the rules, addition happens before multiplication. Since the scoring order (3, 4, 5) doesn't strictly matter for the math because I have no times-multipliers, I'm set.\n\nSo, the action is crystal clear: I'm selecting the round to play. Here's the JSON representing this decision:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"round_select\",\n  \"positions\": null,\n  \"intended_hand_type\": null,\n  \"estimated_chips\": null\n}\n```\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
