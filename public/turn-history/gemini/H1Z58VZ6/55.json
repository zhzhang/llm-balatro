{"reasoning":"**The Critical Decision: Play the Blind**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. It's Round 6, Ante 3/8, and I'm staring down a Blind Select. My primary goal, as always, is to maximize my score and build a *dominant* deck. I've got a fantastic Joker setup: DNA at position 1, Brainstorm at position 2, Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus. My vouchers are Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. Currently, I have zero dollars.\n\nThe options are the Small Blind, Big Blind, and Boss Blind. The Small Blind (2000 chips) is the most strategic option. While the D6 Tag, which grants $0 rerolls, is intriguing, it's not a priority right now, given I have no money. More critically, the DNA + Brainstorm combo is *insane* for deck construction. I can create a permanent doubling effect by playing a single card, so skipping a round sacrifices crucial deck-building potential.\n\nThe immediate payout from the Small Blind is $3, and I can earn more with each hand. Crucially, the $2000 chip requirement is easily manageable, even with my current setup. The Blue Joker, Mail-In Rebate, and Ride the Bus will multiply the chips I already have, even with a low card. My previous High Card scores were a paltry 1,920 and 2,880. Even a low card will produce enough chips to meet the Small Blind. Skipping the round *completely* sacrifices those DNA triggers, which is far more valuable than a potential $0 reroll later.\n\nSo, the optimal move here is to *play the round*. That action immediately provides money, and crucially, gives two DNA and Brainstorm triggers.\n\nI've already confirmed my Joker positions are correct. The JSON will include `action: \"play_round\"`. There's no need to sell anything or use any consumables.\n\n\n","action":"\"play_round\""}
