{"reasoning":"**Ante 3, Round 7: Big Blind - Decision Time**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Ante 3, Big Blind in Round 7. I've got $9. The lineup is looking pretty solid, but let's make sure I'm maximizing efficiency. My Jokers are: DNA (1), Brainstorm (2), Blue Joker (3), Mail-In Rebate (4, holo, +10 mult), and Ride the Bus (5, +7 mult). Vouchers are Hieroglyph, Telescope, and Clearance Sale. Hand levels are High Card Lvl 2 (15x2) and Three of a Kind Lvl 3 (70x7).\n\nThe immediate goal is to crank up High Card plays and scale Ride the Bus. I'm leveraging DNA and Brainstorm for deck manipulation now that I've added that 10 of Diamonds Purple Seal to the mix.\n\nDNA (1) is in the first slot, which Brainstorm (2) is copying. So, my first play of a single card gives me two permanent copies in the deck – this is the key to scaling the deck. Blue Joker (3) is providing a healthy +114 chips. Mail-In Rebate (4) is a Holo and gives me +10 mult, and Ride the Bus (5) is giving me +7 mult. My total multiplier is already at a very healthy 19 (2 from High Card Lvl 2 + 10 from Rebate + 7 from Ride the Bus). Chip-wise, base with a level 2 High Card is 15 plus the card chips and the Blue Joker’s 114, so around 139 chips total. Total score should be around 2,641, which is comfortably above the threshold for the Big Blind in this Ante.\n\nNow, let’s look at the shop. Odd Todd ($3) gives +31 chips for odd cards. I'm already high on chips with Blue Joker, so not necessary. Sly Joker ($2) gives +50 chips for a pair, but I'm focusing on High Card. Not necessary. Reroll ($5) is an option, but I’m at $9. Saving for interest (the $10 threshold) is preferable. Even if I'm under $10, it's smarter to bank that interest.\n\nSo, Odd Todd and Sly Joker are both out. Reroll is out for now.\n\nThe plan: proceed to the Big Blind. I'm at $9. The interest threshold is $5. If I don't spend, I get $1 interest. If I reroll, I go to $4, lose interest. The shop cards aren't useful for this specific build (DNA/Brainstorm High Card). So, save money.\n\nHere's the planned sequence:\n1. Play the 10 of Diamonds (1 card).\n2. DNA creates a copy.\n3. Brainstorm creates another copy.\n4. Score the hand (High Card).\n5. Now I have three 10 of Diamonds (Purple Seal) in the deck.\n6. Discard the Purple Seals for Tarot cards in future turns.\n\nThis is a very solid plan and I'm ready to move forward. The `action`: \"round_select\".\n\nThe final answer:\n`{\"action\": \"round_select\"}`\n\n\n","action":"\"round_select\""}
