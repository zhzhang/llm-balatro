{"reasoning":"**Strategic Booster Pack Analysis - End Game, Ante 8**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: round 26, end game. We're in the standard pack phase with $31 to spend. My current jokers are pretty solid: DNA (Foil), Brainstorm (Holo), Ride the Bus (+36 Mult, no face cards), Steel Joker (X4.2 Mult), and Blue Joker (+198 Chips). My consumable is The Tower (Stone card enhancement).\n\nThe current strategy is High Card level 16, leveraging the DNA/Brainstorm copy strategy. Steel cards are priority because of the Steel Joker's scaling.\n\nLet's look at the pack choices. Option 1 is the 7 of Diamonds (Gold, Purple Seal - creates a Tarot card when discarded). Option 2 is a Stone card (+50 Chips). Option 3 is a basic 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips).\n\nThe 7 of Diamonds with that Purple Seal is *perfect*. The Gold enhancement is nice ($3 at end of round, so worth $3), but the Purple Seal is the real prize here. Tarot cards are crucial for fueling 'The Chariot', which means more Steel cards, directly feeding the Steel Joker. The consistency of Tarot card generation through discards is critical in Ante 8, where we need to find \"The Chariot\" to scale the Steel cards even more for the X4.2 multiplier.\n\nThe Stone Card is tempting for the +50 Chips, but in the long run the Purple Seal is much better at this stage of the game.\n\nThe 4 of Diamonds is basic, and useless.\n\nThe \"Ride the Bus\" joker doesn't care about face cards, and we are working with High Card, so we aren't breaking anything in the chain.\n\nTherefore, the obvious choice is the 7 of Diamonds with the Purple Seal. **I'm selecting option 1.**\n\n\n","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
