{"reasoning":"**My Shopping Spree: Maximizing High Card and Steel Joker Scaling**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for this shop phase. Ante 6/8, Round 20, and I'm laser-focused on maximizing my High Card build while scaling Steel Joker and avoiding face cards for Ride the Bus. I've got $51, and the current goal is to leverage DNA and Brainstorm to get Steel Joker rolling. I have DNA (1), Brainstorm (2), Steel Joker (3), Ride the Bus (4), and Blue Joker (5) in play.\n\nFirst, let's assess the shop. I see Burglar, Business Card, a Jumbo Celestial Pack, and a Celestial Pack. Thanks to my Telescope voucher, both packs *guarantee* a Pluto card, which is essential for High Card. I also have The Tower (1) and Mars (2) in my consumables.\n\nMars isn't doing much for me. It levels up Four of a Kind, which is useless here. The Tower is fantastic; I'll use it later on a card for its Stone enhancement, which is perfect for Ride the Bus. Burglar is tempting for extra hands but potentially disruptive because I have to sell a Joker (Blue, Ride, DNA). Business Card is irrelevant.\n\nHere's the sequence. I need to clear a consumable slot. I'm going to `use_consumable` Mars to get it out of the way. Then, and this is crucial, I will `buy_booster` the Jumbo Celestial Pack and the Celestial Pack to level up High Card. I need to buy both Celestial packs, since the telescope guarantees the Pluto card. They don't take up inventory space, since they are immediately used. Now, if a Spectral or Tarot card appears in the next shop, I'm ready. I have no concerns that the game won't let me buy a booster pack because the inventory is full.\n\nMy Joker layout is correct: DNA (1) and Brainstorm (2), with Brainstorm copying DNA, which is perfect.\n\nSo, the action is to `use_consumable` at position 2 (Mars).\n\n\n","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
