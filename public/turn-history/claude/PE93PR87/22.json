{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Boss Round)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $4\n- Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult (was X1, now upgraded from using the planet card)\n- Max Jokers: 6\n\n## Shop Options\n1. Luchador - $5 (Sell to disable current Boss Blind) - I can't afford this\n2. The Tower - $3 (Enhances 1 card into Stone Card: +50 chips, no rank or suit)\n3. Wasteful - $10 (Permanently +1 discard each round) - Can't afford this\n4. Reroll - $5 - Can't afford this\n\n## Hand Levels After Venus Planet Card\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5 (upgraded from 30/3)\n- Full House: Level 3, Base Chips 90, Base Mult 8\n- Two Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2\n\n## Analysis\n\nI have $4 and this is Round 3, which means I'm about to face the Boss Blind. I only have two options within my budget:\n1. Buy The Tower for $3 (leaves me with $1)\n2. Just advance to round_select\n\nThe Tower enhances 1 card into a Stone Card, which gives +50 chips but removes rank and suit. This means:\n- The card will contribute +50 chips when played\n- But it loses its rank and suit, so it can't contribute to making hands like pairs, straights, flushes, etc.\n\nGiven that I'm playing hands like Three of a Kind, Full House, and Two Pair, having a Stone Card could actually hurt my ability to make these hands. \n\nStone Cards work best when I need raw chip value without relying on hand composition, but with limited funds facing the Boss Blind, the extra +50 chips might be crucial if I'm close to the threshold. The real question is whether converting one card into a Stone Card disrupts my hand-making more than it helps. Since the Stone Card still counts as a card I can play, the other four cards in my hand can still form the necessary combinations—I'd just be sacrificing one card's rank and suit contribution.\n\nThe key constraint is that chip bonuses only apply if the card is part of the highest hand made. So if I play a Stone Card alongside four cards that form a pair, only those pair cards contribute their chips unless the Stone Card itself somehow counts toward the hand. The Stone Card description says \"+50 Chips no rank or suit,\" which suggests it always adds those chips when played, making it valuable even if it doesn't participate in hand formation. This changes the calculation—I need to determine if that guaranteed +50 is worth more than what I'd lose by removing a card's rank or suit from my hand-making potential.\n\nWith $4 remaining and a Boss Blind ahead, I'm weighing whether to enter with my current deck or invest in The Tower. The Stone Card enhancement would guarantee +50 chips on whichever card I apply it to, which could be decisive in a tight matchup. My economy is constrained, so this might be my best opportunity to strengthen my position before facing the boss.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
