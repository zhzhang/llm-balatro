{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (just selected Earth planet to level up Full House)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $4\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per played face card)\n- Full House is now Level 3: 90 base chips, 8 base mult (played 1 time)\n- Next up: Boss Blind requiring 600 chips, which discards 2 random cards per hand\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Raised Fist (Joker) - Adds double the rank of lowest ranked card held in hand to Mult - $5\n2. Reserved Parking (Joker) - Each face card held in hand has a 1 in 2 chance to give $1 - $6\n3. Jumbo Standard Pack (Booster) - Choose 1 of up to 5 Playing cards to add to your deck - $6\n4. Magic Trick (Voucher) - Playing cards can be purchased from the shop - $10\n5. Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Money Analysis:**\nI have $4, which is not enough to buy any of the available items:\n- Raised Fist costs $5 (I'm $1 short)\n- Reserved Parking costs $6 (I'm $2 short)\n- Jumbo Standard Pack costs $6 (I'm $2 short)\n- Magic Trick costs $10 (I'm $6 short)\n- Reroll costs $5 (I'm $1 short)\n\n**My Full House Scoring:**\nWith Full House at Level 3 (90 base chips, 8 base mult), if I can play a typical three 5s and two 6s:\n- Base chips: 90\n- Card chips: 5+5+5+6+6 = 27\n\n\n- Total chips: 117\n- Total mult: 8\n- Score: 117 × 8 = 936 chips\n\nThis comfortably beats the 600 chip requirement for the Boss Blind, even accounting for the 2 random discards per hand. I could sell Smiley Face for $2 to reach $6, which would allow me to purchase either Raised Fist ($5) or Jumbo Standard Pack/Reserved Parking ($6 each). The key decision is whether gaining a new joker or additional cards is worth losing my current +5 Mult per face card bonus.\n\nSmiley Face isn't contributing to my Full House strategy since I'm playing three 5s and two 6s—no face cards involved. Raised Fist would add double the lowest card's rank to Mult, so with a 5 as my minimum, I'd gain +10 Mult. This boost could meaningfully improve my score, though I'd be sacrificing a joker slot to do it.\n\nReserved Parking generates money through face cards, which doesn't help me meet the 600-chip threshold. Jumbo Standard Pack adds a card to my deck, but I already have sufficient cards to consistently form my Full House. Since my Level 3 Full House already produces 936 chips—well above what I need—and the boss only discards 2 cards per hand while I start with 8, I should maintain enough cards to execute my strategy reliably.\n\nThe optimal play is to skip purchases entirely. My current hand strength is sufficient, and preserving my joker and capital for future rounds offers more strategic value than spending on redundant upgrades now.","action":"\"round_select\""}
