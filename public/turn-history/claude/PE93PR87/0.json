{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 0 (just starting)\n- At BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Current Money: $4\n- No jokers, no consumables yet\n- This is the Small Blind requiring 300 chips\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Play the Small Blind** - Reward: $3\n   - Need 300 chips\n   - Standard starting deck should easily handle this\n   \n2. **Skip for D6 Tag** - Tag benefit: \"Rerolls in next shop start at $0\"\n   - This means I can reroll the shop for free\n   - I'd miss out on $3 reward but get free rerolls in shop\n   - This could be valuable for finding good jokers early\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Small Blind at 300 chips is very easy to beat with a standard deck. Even with just pairs and high cards, reaching 300 should be trivial.\n\nThe D6 Tag gives free rerolls in the next shop. This is moderately useful but not critical, especially this early when:\n- I only have $4, so I can't afford expensive jokers anyway\n- Free rerolls are nice but not game-changing at this stage\n- I'd be giving up $3 (the reward for beating Small Blind)\n\nIf I play and win the Small Blind:\n- I get $3 reward\n- Plus any leftover hand money and interest\n- I'll have ~$7+ going into the shop\n- This gives me more buying power for the first shop\n\nIf I skip:\n- I keep my $4\n- I get free rerolls but limited buying power\n- I'd still need to face the Big Blind next\n\n**The Polychrome Tag for skipping Big Blind is MUCH more valuable** - getting a free Polychrome joker is huge. But I should probably play the Small Blind first to get more money.\n\n**Decision:** Play the Small Blind. It's easy to beat, gives us $3, and sets us up better financially for the shop. The D6 Tag is nice but not worth sacrificing the easy $3 and the round completion.\n\n\nI'll proceed with playing this round to secure the $3 reward and build up my bankroll before hitting the shop.","action":"\"play_round\""}
