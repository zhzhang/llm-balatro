{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $3\n- Hierarchies: -1 Ante, -1 hand each round\n\n## Blind Options\n1. **Small Blind**: 2000 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Tag for skipping: Voucher Tag (adds one voucher to next shop)\n   \n2. **Big Blind**: 3000 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Tag for skipping: Juggle Tag (+3 hand size next round)\n   \n3. **Boss Blind**: 4000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss Effect: No repeat hand types this round\n   - Cannot be skipped\n\n## My Current Jokers\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.3 Mult (scales with Planet cards)\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n4. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if played hand contains Three of a Kind\n\n## Hand Levels\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 base chips, 7 base mult) - my main strategy\n- Full House: Level 4 (115 base chips, 10 base mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 base chips, 2 base mult)\n\n## Recent Performance\n- Last Three of a Kind scored 2,243.6 chips (Ante 2 Boss)\n- Two Pair scored 1,452 chips (Ante 2 Big Blind)\n- Full House scored 552 chips (Ante 1 Big Blind)\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe Small Blind needs 2000 chips. Let me calculate if I can beat it:\n\nWith Three of a Kind:\n\n\n- Base: 70 chips, 7 mult\n- Wily Joker: +100 chips\n- Half Joker: +20 mult (if 3 or fewer cards)\n- Constellation: X1.3 mult\n- Smiley Face: +5 mult per face card\n\nIf I play 3 cards (Three of a Kind):\n- Chips: 70 (base) + 100 (Wily) + card chips = 170+ chips\n- Mult: 7 (base) + 20 (Half Joker) = 27 mult\n- With Constellation: 27 * 1.3 = 35.1 mult\n\nThis gives me roughly 170 × 35 = 5,950 chips before face card bonuses, which easily clears 2000. Three of a Kind is my strongest hand and should handle the Small Blind comfortably.\n\nNow I'm weighing whether to skip and grab the Voucher Tag. The tag would give me an extra voucher in the next shop, but I'm sitting on just $3, which limits what I can actually purchase. Playing this hand nets me $3 plus potential interest, whereas skipping trades immediate cash for future shop access. Given my tight budget, the money from playing seems more practical right now.\n\nThe real question is what the boss blind demands—I need to assess whether my current setup can handle whatever comes next.","action":"\"play_round\""}
