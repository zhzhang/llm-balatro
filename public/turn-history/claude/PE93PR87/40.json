{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $4\n- Next blind: Boss Blind requiring 1600 chips, with 7 cards face down\n\n## Current Inventory\nJokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult, +1 joker slot\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n\nConsumables:\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank/suit)\n2. Venus - Levels up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\nMax Consumables: 2 (full)\n\nTags:\n1. Investment Tag - After defeating the Boss Blind, gain $25\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. The Hanged Man - Destroys up to 2 selected cards - $3\n2. Certificate - When round begins, add random playing card with random seal to hand - $6\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nI have $4, so I can:\n- Buy The Hanged Man ($3) - leaves me with $1\n- Buy Arcana Pack ($4) - leaves me with $0\n- Cannot afford Certificate ($6) or reroll ($5)\n\nLooking at my previous actions, I selected The Fool (which gave me Venus) and then tried to select Justice (position 2). But looking at the booster pack choices from Turn 40:\n1. Judgement\n2. Justice\n3. The Devil\n4. Strength\n\nSo I selected positions 2 and 4, which would be Justice and Strength. However, I'm back in the SHOP phase now, which suggests I've completed the booster pack selection.\n\n\nI notice Venus is my only new consumable, which means Justice wasn't added—likely because I was already at max capacity. The Boss Blind ahead still demands 1600 chips, so I need to consider whether to activate Venus now to boost Three of a Kind from Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult) to Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult), or preserve it for later use.\n\nI could spend my remaining $4 on an Arcana Pack for additional Tarot cards, but that would require discarding something first since I'm at max consumables. The Hanged Man ($3) would let me destroy up to 2 weak cards, while The Tower could enhance a card into Stone Card for a chip boost. Alternatively, I could skip purchases and move forward with what I have.\n\nGiven the Boss Blind setup with 7 face-down cards, I need to maximize my scoring. Leveling Three of a Kind with Venus is the strongest play—it guarantees a +40 chip and +4 mult increase, which scales across any hand composition and pushes Constellation to X1.2. After using Venus, I'd have a free consumable slot to grab the Arcana Pack if needed. With Three of a Kind at Level 4, I'd be looking at 90 base chips and 9 mult, which becomes significantly more powerful if I can play three face cards. d type and keeps The Tower available as a fallback to strengthen a critical card if the situation demands it.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
