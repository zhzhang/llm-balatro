{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully.\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $22\n- Just bought Wasteful voucher for $10 (had $32, now have $22)\n\n## Current Inventory\nJokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.2 Mult (gains X0.1 per Planet card used) - Negative edition (+1 Joker slot)\n3.

Wasteful - Permanently gain +1 discard each round (just bought)\n2. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round\n\nMax Jokers: 6 (base 5 + 1 from Constellation's Negative edition)\nMax Consumables: 2\n\n## Shop Options (Current)\nCards:\n1. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring, +50 chips, Foil edition - $5\n2. Lusty Joker - Played cards with Heart suit give +3 Mult when scored - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - $4\n2. Jumbo Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards - $6\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nI have $22 left to spend. I'm entering Ante 3, which will be significantly harder than Ante 2.\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - my most played hand (4 times)\n\n\n- Full House: Level 3 (90 chips, 8 mult) - played once\n- Most other hands are Level 1\n\nMy joker synergies:\n- Smiley Face works with face cards\n- Constellation scales with Planet cards (currently X1.2, would benefit from more Planet cards)\n- Half Joker rewards 3-card hands\n\nThe Splash Joker presents a tension with my current strategy—it encourages playing all cards in hand, which directly conflicts with Half Joker's bonus for minimal card plays. I need to decide whether to lean into one approach or find a way to balance both mechanics.\n\nLusty Joker doesn't align with my current deck composition since I haven't built around Hearts. Standard Pack offers a straightforward way to improve my hand composition at a reasonable cost. Jumbo Arcana Pack could provide valuable enhancements like additional Tower cards for deck manipulation. A Reroll might also be worth considering to refresh my shop options.\n\nMoving into Ante 3 requires significant scoring improvements. My priority should be leveling up my most-played hands—Three of a Kind and Full House—while securing better jokers for multiplicative scaling. Planet cards are particularly valuable since they both increase hand base stats and feed into my Constellation joker's scaling. The Jumbo Arcana Pack appeals to me because I can evaluate five Tarot options and immediately select the most useful one, potentially getting another Tower or similar enhancement. However, Planet cards might offer better long-term value by systematically strengthening my core hands.\n\nA reroll costs $5, leaving me $17 afterward. The chip requirements jump substantially in Ante 3—I'm estimating the Boss stage will demand around 4500-5500 chips. My current Three of a Kind setup (Level 3 with 70 chips and 7 mult) plus supporting cards only generates roughly 100 base chips, which falls far short of what I'll need.\n\nI should prioritize finding Planet cards to level up my hands and amplify Constellation's scaling effect. Since the shop lacks Planet packs right now, rerolling makes sense—it could surface a Celestial Pack or stronger jokers that would push my damage output higher.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
