{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 2/8 (down from 3/8 due to Hieroglyph voucher), Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n- Just bought Hieroglyph voucher for $10\n\n## Inventory\n- Jokers (3/6 slots):\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult (gains X0.1 per planet card), +1 joker slot\n  3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n- Consumables (1/2 slots):\n  1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round\n\n## Shop Offers\nCards:\n1. Spare Trousers - +2 Mult per Two Pair (currently +0) - $6 (can't afford)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n2. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards - $4\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n## Current Synergy\nMy Three of a Kind with face cards strategy is very strong:\n- Base: 50 chips, 5 mult\n- Three face cards: +30 chips (total 80 chips)\n- Smiley Face: +15 mult (3 face cards × +5)\n- Half Joker: +20 mult (if 3 cards)\n- Constellation: ×1.1 mult\n- Total: 80 × (5 + 15 + 20) × 1.1 = 80 × 44 = 3,520 chips\n\n\n- This scoring is already quite strong.\n\nWith $5 available, I could grab a Standard or Arcana Pack for $4 to add more tools to my deck, reroll the shop for $5 hoping to find planet cards to scale Constellation further, or simply advance to the next round. The core decision is whether improving my current setup through additional cards or searching for specific synergy pieces makes more sense given my already solid damage output.\n\nI have The Tower available to turn a card into a Stone Card for +50 chips, which pairs well with my Three of a Kind. Three open joker slots remain unfilled, and Constellation scales significantly with planet cards. Given these constraints and the strong foundation I've built, rerolling seems like the better play—I'm looking for planets to level up my hand types or jokers that fill gaps better than what's currently available. Spare Trousers doesn't seem worth keeping anyway.\n\nBut I'm hesitant because spending my full $5 on a reroll leaves me vulnerable if nothing good appears. The Arcana Pack at $4 would let me grab a tarot card immediately to enhance my deck right now, which feels safer. Still, my real bottleneck is finding better jokers and planets rather than consumables—a reroll targets exactly what I need most. I should just move on to the next round. My setup is already very strong with 3,500+ chip potential per hand. I don't need to spend more money right now, and I should save for better opportunities later.\n\nLet me go with **round_select** to move on.","action":"\"round_select\""}
