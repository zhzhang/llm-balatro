With Wily Joker now purchased, my Three of a Kind strategy is very strong. Let me think about what to do next:\n\n1. **Sly Joker ($3)**: Adds +50 chips for pairs. My history shows I've played Two Pair twice, but it's not my main strategy. This could be useful for fallback hands, but it's not as critical as improving my main Three of a Kind strategy.\n\n2. **Standard Pack ($4)**: Could add a useful card to my deck. \n\nThe Standard Pack might help me get better cards for forming Three of a Kind hands. The Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6) offers more Tarot options—potentially useful enhancements like additional Stone cards or other powerful effects. I could also reroll ($6) to find a Planet pack, which would level up my hands and boost Constellation's multiplier. Since I'm moving into Ante 3, I should prioritize strengthening my Three of a Kind core, which is now my primary scoring engine. I'm weighing my options carefully. The Jumbo Arcana Pack stands out as the strongest choice—Tarot cards offer substantial upgrades like The Tower for Stone cards (each worth +50 chips), The Strength to boost card ranks, or The Wheel of Fortune for powerful editions. Adding a few Stone cards to my hand would meaningfully increase my scoring. The Standard Pack and Reroll are safer but less impactful, while the Sly Joker feels redundant given my current setup.\n\nI'll go with the Jumbo Arcana Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
