{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (Big Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 1200\n- Current Money: $5\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n## My Hand\n1. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n3. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n4. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5. King of Clubs (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n6. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n8. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n\n## My Jokers\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n\n## Possible Plays\n\n### Option 1: Play the Pair of Kings (positions 2, 5)\n- Hand type: Pair\n- Base: 10 chips, 2 mult (Level 1)\n- Two Kings: +20 chips (total 30 chips)\n- Smiley Face: +10 mult (2 face cards × +5)\n- Half Joker: +20 mult (2 cards, which is ≤3)\n- Constellation: ×1.1 mult\n- Total mult: (2 + 10 + 20) × 1.1 = 32 × 1.1 = 35.2 mult\n- Total chips: 30 × 35.2 = 1,056 chips\n\nThis is close to 1200 but not quite enough.\n\n\nI could discard to hunt for a Three of a Kind, which would give me significantly more chips. With only 3 hands left, I need to be strategic—I have 2 Kings and there are 2 more in the deck. Alternatively, I have 5 clubs available (Ace, King, 10, 9, 4) which could form a flush.\n\nPlaying the flush would score 79 chips with a 9.9x multiplier from Smiley Face and Constellation, totaling 782 chips—still insufficient. Let me explore other discard options.\n\nI could discard the low cards (3♠, 6♥, 10♣, 9♣, 4♣) and keep the Kings and Ace, drawing 5 new cards to potentially strengthen the hand. But first, let me verify what a pair of Kings would actually yield. Playing just the two Kings gives me a base of 10 chips from the pair itself, plus 20 chips from the two cards (10 each). Smiley Face adds 10 mult from the two face cards, Half Joker contributes 20 mult, and with the base 2 mult, I'm at 32 total mult before Constellation multiplies it by 1.1 to reach 35.2. That gives 30 × 35.2 = 1,056 chips—still short of the 1,200 I need. I should focus on building toward a Three of a Kind instead, which would give me a better foundation to work with.\n\nIf I can assemble three face cards, the scoring jumps significantly: 50 base chips plus 30 from the three cards, Smiley Face jumps to 15 mult, Half Joker stays at 20 mult, and Constellation pushes the total mult to 44. That yields 80 × 44 = 3,520 chips, which easily surpasses my target. My best move is to discard strategically and hunt for a third King or another face card.\n\nI'll get rid of the low cards—1, 3, 6, 7, 8—while keeping the Ace since it has decent value.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,6,7,8]"}
