{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $1\n- Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n\n## Blind Select Options\n\n**Current Blind: Small Blind**\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Reward: $3\n- Tag for skipping: Garbage Tag (gives $1 per unused discard, would give $9)\n\n**Upcoming Blind: Big Blind**\n- Chips Needed: 1200\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Ethereal Tag (gives free Spectral Pack)\n\n**Upcoming Blind: Boss**\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Boss Description: \"Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\"\n- Reward: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe boss blind effect is concerning: \"Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed.\" This means any cards I use in the Small or Big blind will be debuffed in the Boss blind. Debuffed cards have their abilities and chip values disabled but still participate in forming hand types.\n\nLooking at my hand history:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, 50 chips, 5 mult (played twice)\n- Full House: Level 3, 90 chips, 8 mult (played once)\n- Two Pair: scored 600 chips once (likely with joker synergy)\n\nWith Smiley Face (+5 mult per face card) and Constellation (X1.1 mult), I can likely beat 800 chips for the Small Blind.\n\n**Option 1: Play the Small Blind**\n- Pros: Get $3 reward, plus potential interest and leftover hands\n\n\n- Cons: Cards I use will be debuffed in Boss blind\n\n**Option 2: Skip for Garbage Tag**\nThe Garbage Tag offers $9 immediately from unused discards—a significant boost when I only have $1. Skipping nets me $6 more than playing, bringing my total to $10, which opens up better shop purchases or voucher options. However, I'd proceed directly to the Big Blind without the Small Blind reward. The real issue is that playing both Small and Big blinds means most of my cards get debuffed before facing the Boss, severely limiting my options there.\n\nI need to clarify what \"cards played previously\" actually means—whether it's individual card instances or specific ranks/suits. If it refers to particular cards I've already used, then playing Small Blind could significantly compromise my Boss performance. Skipping Small Blind lets me preserve my full deck strength for the mandatory Boss encounter, though I'd still need to decide whether to play or skip Big Blind afterward.\n\nThe economic angle is compelling too. With $1 on hand and Garbage Tag providing $9, I'd reach $10 total—enough for meaningful shop decisions like rerolls or upgrades. That financial cushion might matter more than the immediate Small Blind payout of $3.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
