{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $0\n- Current Blind: Boss Blind requiring 1600 chips with 7 cards face down\n\n## Current Inventory\nJokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.2 Mult\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n\nConsumables:\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank/suit)\n\nTags:\n1. Investment Tag - After defeating Boss Blind, gain $25\n\n## Previous Context\nLooking at my previous actions, I:\n- Used Venus to level up Three of a Kind to Level 3\n- Bought an Arcana Pack\n- Used The Lovers to enhance the Queen of Diamonds into a Wild Card\n- Now I'm at the Blind Select screen\n\nThe Boss Blind has a special effect: \"7 cards get drawn face down\". This means 7 cards in my deck will be face down when drawn, so I won't be able to see what they are until I play them.\n\nFrom turn 43, I had the following hand:\n- 7 of Spades\n- King of Hearts\n- Jack of Hearts\n- 10 of Hearts\n- 7 of Hearts\n- 8 of Clubs\n- Queen of Diamonds (now Wild Card)\n- 8 of Diamonds\n\nWith the Queen as a Wild Card, I can form a Heart flush with King, Jack, 10, 7 of Hearts + Queen (acting as a Heart). This would give me a strong hand.\n\n## Available Commands\n- play_round - Play the current round\n- use_consumable\n- sell_consumable\n- rearrange_jokers\n- sell_joker\n\nSince I'm in BLIND_SELECT phase, I should use play_round to start the Boss Blind. The boss cannot be skipped, so I must play it.\n\n\nI should hold onto The Tower for now since I won't know which cards are most valuable until the round starts and I see what's been drawn. The joker arrangement could matter for scoring efficiency—Constellation multiplies the total mult, so positioning it after Smiley Face would maximize the effect, but I'll assess this once I see my actual hand composition during play. Since all my jokers are independent and activate left-to-right, I need to reconsider their order. With Smiley Face providing +15 mult, Half Joker adding +20 mult, and Constellation multiplying by x1.2, the math shows I should stack the additive effects first before applying the multiplier. That would yield 39 mult before Constellation's x1.2 boost, reaching 46.8 total. My current arrangement—Smiley Face, then Constellation, then Half Joker—only gets me to 22.8 mult before the final addition, which is significantly less efficient.\n\nHowever, I'm realizing Half Joker has a critical condition: it only triggers when the hand has 3 or fewer cards. If I'm playing a 5-card flush, it won't activate at all, so I need to rethink my approach entirely. For a 5-card Heart flush with face cards, I'd get the base 35 chips and 4 mult, plus Smiley Face's +15 mult and Constellation's x1.2 multiplier, but Half Joker becomes irrelevant.\n\nWith a 3-card hand like Three of a Kind, the joker order suddenly matters. I'd want to apply Smiley Face and Half Joker additively before multiplying by Constellation to maximize the effect.\n\nThe optimal arrangement would be positions 1 (Smiley), 3 (Half), 2 (Constellation), which lets both additive bonuses stack before the multiplication kicks in.\n\nI can't use The Tower on cards right now since I'm still in the selection phase—I need to actually be in the round with cards in hand to apply consumables. So I should just start playing.","action":"\"play_round\""}
