{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (Big Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 1200\n- Current Money: $5\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n## My Current Hand\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n3. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n4. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5. King of Clubs (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n6. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n8. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n\n## My Jokers\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n\n## Analysis of Hand Options\n\nI have an excellent hand now! Let me identify the possible plays:\n\n### Face Cards: Queen♠, King♥, King♣, Queen♦, Jack♦\n### Aces: Ace♣, Ace♦\n\n### Option 1: Two Pair (2 Kings + 2 Queens)\n- Play positions: 1, 2, 5, 7 (Queen♠, King♥, King♣, Queen♦)\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult (Level 1)\n- Cards: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 chips (total 60 chips)\n- Smiley Face: +20 mult (4 face cards × +5)\n\n\n- Half Joker doesn't activate since I'm playing 4 cards, not 3 or fewer. Constellation multiplies the total by 1.1, giving me (2 + 20) × 1.1 = 24.2 mult, which yields 60 × 24.2 = 1,452 chips ✓\n\n### Option 2: Two Pair (2 Aces + 2 Kings)\n- Play positions: 2, 4, 5, 6 (King♥, Ace♣, King♣, Ace♦)\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult (Level 1)\n- Cards: 10 + 11 + 10 + 11 = 42 chips (total 62 chips)\n- Smiley Face: +10 mult (2 face cards × +5)\n- Half Joker: +0 mult (4 cards > 3)\n- Constellation: ×1.1 mult\n- Total mult: (2 + 10) × 1.1 = 12 × 1.1 = 13.2 mult\n- Total chips: 62 × 13.2 = 818 chips ✗\n\n### Option 3: Two Pair (2 Aces + 2 Queens)\n- Play positions: 1, 4, 6, 7 (Queen♠, Ace♣, Ace♦, Queen\n\n♦)\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult (Level 1)\n- Cards: 10 + 11 + 11 + 10 = 42 chips (total 62 chips)\n- Smiley Face: +10 mult (2 face cards × +5)\n- Half Joker: +0 mult (4 cards > 3)\n- Constellation: ×1.1 mult\n- Total mult: (2 + 10) × 1.1 = 13.2 mult\n- Total chips: 62 × 13.2 = 818 chips ✗\n\n### Option 4: Three of a Kind (3 face cards - Queen, King, King OR Queen, Queen, Jack)\nI'm limited by my face card distribution—only 2 Queens, 2 Kings, and 1 Jack available. This constraint prevents me from forming a proper three of a kind with the cards I have.\n\n### Option 5: Full House\nA full house requires three of one rank and two of another. With my current hand (2 Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Aces, 1 Jack, 1 5), I lack the three-of-a-kind component needed to construct this hand.\n\nThe strongest play remains **Two Pair using 2 Kings + 2 Queens**, yielding 1,452 chips.\n\nThis exceeds the 1,200 chip threshold, so I'll go with positions 1, 2, 5, 7 (Queen♠, King♥, King♣, Queen♦).","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,7]"}
