{"reasoning":"I'm in a Tarot Pack selection phase. Let me analyze the options:\n\n1. **Judgement** - Creates a random Joker card (must have room)\n2. **Temperance** - Gives the total sell value of all current Jokers ($11)\n3. **The Fool** - Creates the last Tarot or Planet card used during this run (The Lovers)\n4. **Death** - Select 2 cards, convert the left card into the right card\n5. **The High Priestess** - Creates up to 2 random Planet cards (must have room)\n\n## Current Situation\n- I have 4/6 Joker slots filled\n- I have 1/2 Consumable slots filled (The Tower)\n- My main strategy is Three of a Kind\n- I have Constellation joker that scales with Planet cards (currently X1.2)\n- Three of a Kind is Level 3 (70 base chips, 7 base mult)\n\n## Analysis of Options\n\n**Judgement**: I have room for 2 more jokers, so this could work. However, it's random and I already have a solid Three of a Kind strategy. This is risky but could be powerful.\n\n**Temperance**: Gives me $11. Not immediately useful since I already spent most of my money and am about to enter the blind selection phase. This doesn't improve my deck or strategy.\n\n**The Fool**: Creates \"The Lovers\" which enhances a card into a Wild Card. The Lovers can be useful for completing hands, as Wild cards count as any suit. This could help me form flushes or other suit-dependent hands, but my strategy doesn't really rely on suits.\n\n**Death**: This is powerful for deck manipulation. I could convert a weaker card into a stronger one. Looking at my hand:\n- Two Queens (Hearts and Clubs)\n- Two 8s (Hearts and Diamonds)\n- Two 6s (Clubs and Diamonds)\n\n\n- One Ace of Hearts\n- One 4 of Clubs\n\nI could convert the 4 of Clubs into a Queen, 8, or 6 to create three of a kind, but Death is consumed immediately so I can't save it for later.\n\n**The High Priestess**: Creates up to 2 random Planet cards. This is extremely strong for my build since Planet cards level up hand types and each one gives Constellation an additional X0.1 Mult. This directly strengthens my Three of a Kind strategy and synergizes perfectly with my existing Constellation joker.\n\nThe High Priestess appears to be the strongest option. It generates Planet cards to boost my hands, pushing Constellation from X1.2 to X1.4 Mult, and I have room in my consumable slots—currently at 1/2 with The Tower taking one slot. Since The High Priestess creates \"up to 2\" Planet cards and I only have 1 available slot, it will likely create just 1 card to fit the space constraint.\n\nThough this is less impactful than initially thought, I still gain a Planet card to level up a hand and increase Constellation's multiplier by X0.1. Death could alternatively improve my deck by converting cards into triplets for more consistent Three of a Kind hands, but the immediate boost from The High Priestess seems more valuable right now.\n\nThe High Priestess offers compounding returns—leveling up a hand type like Three of a Kind or Full House while pushing Constellation toward X1.3 Mult creates better scaling than Death's one-time deck modification. I'll go with The High Priestess.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
