{"reasoning":"I'm in a TAROT_PACK state after buying a Mega Arcana Pack. I've already selected The Fool (position 2) which gave me Venus. Now I need to select one more card from the remaining options.\n\nCurrent remaining options:\n1. Judgement - Creates a random Joker card (must have room)\n2. Justice - Enhances 1 card into Glass Card (X2 Mult, 1 in 4 chance to destroy)\n3. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card ($3 if held in hand at end of round)\n4. Strength - Increases rank of up to 2 selected cards by 1\n\nMy consumables are now:\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n2. Venus - Levels up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\n\nI'm at max consumables (2/2), so if I want to take Justice, I'd need to use it immediately or I wouldn't be able to select it.\n\nLet me think about the upcoming Boss Blind:\n- Need 1600 chips\n- 7 cards will be face down (only 1 visible out of 8)\n- This makes strategic card selection very difficult\n\nCurrent hand:\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n4. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n6. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\nI have: 2 Queens, 1 King, 1 Ace, 2 Fours, 1 Nine, 1 Seven\n\nMy jokers:\n- Smiley Face: +5 Mult per face card scored\n\n\n- Constellation: X1.2 Mult (Venus will level it up from X1.1)\n- Half Joker: +20 Mult if 3 or fewer cards played\n\nLooking at my options, Judgement gives unpredictable value but I have room for another joker. Justice is extremely strong—applying Glass to a face card would double my entire multiplier when scored, though the destruction risk is concerning. The Devil and Strength offer more modest benefits compared to the multiplicative power of Glass.\n\nFor this Boss Blind where I can't see cards, Justice feels like the right call since X2 Mult is so potent regardless of which cards I actually play. The 1 in 4 destruction chance is worth the potential payoff, but I'm at max consumables so I'd need to use it right away.\n\nLooking at my options more carefully - Judgement is too unpredictable, The Devil doesn't help against the Boss, and Strength could bump my Fours to Fives but that's modest compared to doubling a face card's multiplier. Justice targeting one of my Queens or the King seems like the strongest play for this specific challenge.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,4]"}
