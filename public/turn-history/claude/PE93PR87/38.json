Strength - Increases rank of up to 2 selected cards by 1\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe upcoming Boss Blind is very challenging with 7 cards face down. I need to maximize my scoring potential.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Judgement** - Random joker. This could be good or bad. Given my situation, I need something more reliable.\n\n2. **The Fool** - This would give me Venus, which levels up Three of a Kind. Three of a Kind is at Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult). \n\nThe Fool would bump it to Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult), which is substantial since I've been relying on Three of a Kind regularly. But it's a planet card that activates immediately.\n\n3. **Justice** - Glass Card enhancement (X2 Mult) is extremely powerful. Applying it to a high card like a King or Ace doubles the multiplier when scored, though the 1 in 4 destruction risk is a drawback.\n\n4. **The Devil** - Gold Card provides $3 at end of round if held, which doesn't help with the immediate Boss fight.\n\n5. **Strength** - Rank increases for up to 2 cards could help boost scoring potential.\n\nFor this Boss Blind with face-down cards, I need to think strategically about what maximizes my scoring. The Fool (Venus) stands out because leveling Three of a Kind to 90/9 is a major upgrade, and even with blind plays I might still form trips. Justice (Glass Card) is also compelling since X2 mult on a high card is enormous, and even face-down, if I play it correctly it will trigger—though there's a 25% destruction risk that I'd have to accept for this critical fight.\n\nRunning the numbers: if I use The Fool and get Venus to level Three of a Kind, playing three face cards would give me 120 chips with 26.4 mult after Constellation, totaling over 3,000 chips.\n\nJustice offers a Glass Card with X2 mult that could multiply my score significantly after all additive bonuses. But I'm already holding The Tower, so picking Justice would max out my consumable slots. The Fool works immediately as a planet card to boost Three of a Kind, while Justice would stay in my hand—I need to decide if that flexibility is worth the inventory constraint.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
