{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Blind: Small (2000 chips needed)\n- Current Money: $3\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 3\n- Current chips: 0\n\n## Current Hand\n1. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n2. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n3. King of Clubs (+10 chips, X2 Mult, Glass Card) - face card\n4. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips) - face card\n6. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n## Jokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.3 Mult\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n4. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if played hand contains Three of a Kind\n\n## Analyzing the hand:\n- Pair of 10s (10 of Clubs position 4, 10 of Diamonds position 6)\n- Two face cards: King of Clubs (position 3) and Jack of Diamonds (position 5)\n- King of Clubs is a Glass Card (X2 Mult)\n- Four Diamonds: Jack, 10, 6, 4\n\nStill no Three of a Kind. Let me check my options:\n\n### Option 1: Play the pair of 10s with the King (3 cards)\nPlaying positions 3, 4, 6 (King of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds)\n- Hand type: Pair\n\n\n- Base: 10 chips, 2 mult\n- Card chips: 10 (King) + 10 (10C) + 10 (10D) = 30 chips\n- Total chips: 10 + 30 = 40 chips\n- Mult: 2 base\n  - +5 from Smiley Face (King is a face card)\n  - +20 from Half Joker (3 cards)\n  - = 27 mult\n  - Glass Card X2 Mult = 54 mult\n  - Constellation X1.3 = 70.2 mult\n- Final score: 40 × 70.2 = 2,808 chips\n\nNeed to verify the order of operations though. The Glass Card enhancement applies when the King scores during the card evaluation phase, so the X2 multiplier takes effect at that point. Base multiplier starts at 2, then Smiley Face adds 5 for the face card, Half Joker contributes 20 from the three cards played, reaching 27 before the Glass Card doubles it to 54, and Constellation multiplies the final multiplier by 1.3 to get 70.2.\n\nWith 40 chips from the three tens, that gives 2,808 chips total—still not enough. I should explore other options like continuing to discard and search for a Three of a Kind, since there are only 2 tens left in the remaining 35 cards.\n\nLet me recalculate the Glass Card and Smiley Face interactions more carefully. When the King of Clubs is scored, it triggers both the Glass Card's X2 multiplier and the Smiley Face's +5 multiplier simultaneously.\n\nScoring the three cards (King, 10, 10):\n- King of Clubs: 10 chips, then Glass Card doubles mult to 4, Smiley Face adds 5 for 9 total mult\n- The two 10s each add 10 chips\n- Half Joker contributes +20 mult after all cards score\n- Constellation applies X1.3 to the final multiplier\n\nThis gives 40 chips × 37.7 mult = 1,508 chips, which still falls short. Trying a different combination with the Jack might yield better results. 41.6 mult\n\nFinal: 65 × 41.6 = 2,704 chips\n\nThis clears the 2000 chip threshold. Let me verify the scoring sequence though—cards activate left to right, with each triggering its base chips, then enhancements and seals, then any \"on scored\" Jokers before moving to the next card. After all cards finish, independent Jokers like Half Joker and Constellation apply their effects. Rechecking with the King, Jack, and 10 in positions 3, 5, and 6: King adds 10 chips and gets doubled by Glass for 2 mult, then Smiley adds 5 for 7 total. Jack contributes another 10 chips and 5 mult from Smiley. The 10 adds 10 more chips. Half Joker then multiplies by 20, and Constellation multiplies the result by 1.3, giving 41.6 mult against 35 chips—only 1,456 total. I need to try using both 10s instead to get enough chips.\n\nWith both 10s and Jack, I'd have 45 chips but lose the Half Joker trigger since they're in positions 3-6. Even with Constellation's 1.3x multiplier on 12 mult, this only reaches 702 chips. I should discard and look for Three of a Kind, since Wily Joker's +100 chips bonus would give me the score I need.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
