{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (just beat Big Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $8\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per played face card)\n- Full House is now Level 2: 65 base chips, 6 base mult (played 1 time)\n- Three of a Kind is Level 1: 30 base chips, 3 base mult (played 2 times)\n\n**Upcoming:**\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, discards 2 random cards per hand\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Raised Fist (Joker) - Adds double the rank of lowest ranked card held in hand to Mult - $5\n2. Reserved Parking (Joker) - Each face card held in hand has a 1 in 2 chance to give $1 - $6\n3. Celestial Pack (Booster) - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately - $4\n4. Jumbo Standard Pack (Booster) - Choose 1 of up to 5 Playing cards to add to your deck - $6\n5. Magic Trick (Voucher) - Playing cards can be purchased from the shop - $10\n6. Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith $8, I need to prepare for the Boss Blind (600 chips needed, discards 2 random cards per hand).\n\nThe boss effect is nasty - it discards 2 random cards per hand, which means:\n- I'll lose 2 cards from my hand after each play\n- This makes it harder to form good hands\n- I need to be efficient with my hands\n\nCurrent strategy: I've been successfully using Full House (Level 2) which scored 552 chips, well above the 600 needed. However, with cards being discarded randomly by the boss, I need to ensure I can still form strong hands.\n\n\nLooking at what's available: Raised Fist adds mult based on my lowest card's rank, but that's unreliable when the boss is randomly discarding cards from my hand. Reserved Parking generates money through face cards, which doesn't directly help me hit 600 chips. Celestial Pack could boost my scoring with planet effects, and the Jumbo Pack would let me add more cards to my deck for better hand formation odds despite the discard pressure.\n\nThe Celestial Pack stands out most—leveling up Full House to Level 3 would significantly increase my base chips and mult output, giving me a real path to the score I need. I could also use the planet on Three of a Kind as a backup if Full House isn't viable.\n\nAfter purchasing it, I'll have $4 remaining, which isn't enough for another shop item, so I should move straight to facing the Boss Blind. The boss's card discard mechanic makes hand consistency tricky, but the permanent hand level boost from the Celestial Pack outweighs the temporary mult from something like Raised Fist.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
