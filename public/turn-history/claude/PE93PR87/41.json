Three of a Kind was at Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult). After using Venus which levels it up once, it should be at Level 3 with 70 chips and 7 mult. That checks out - it went from Level 2 to Level 3.\n\nBut wait, Venus description says \"( lvl.2 ) Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\". This is a planet card, and the lvl.2 means it's a level 2 planet card. \n\nSo it should level up Three of a Kind twice (once per level of the planet card). Looking at the progression:\n- Level 1: 30 chips, 3 mult\n- Level 2: 50 chips, 5 mult (+20 chips, +2 mult)\n- Level 3: 70 chips, 7 mult (+20 chips, +2 mult)\n- Level 4: 90 chips, 9 mult (+20 chips, +2 mult)\n\nSo Venus at level 2 should level up Three of a Kind twice, taking it from Level 2 to Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult). But I only see it at Level 3. This means Venus only leveled it up once, not twice. Either the planet card mechanic works differently than I thought, or there's something else going on here.\n\nActually, rereading Venus's description: \"( lvl.2 ) Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\" - this probably means using the level 2 planet card triggers one level-up with those specific stat gains, not two separate level-ups. Three of a Kind is now at Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult), and Constellation has reached X1.2 Mult. With $4 available, I can purchase The Hanged Man for $3, which destroys up to 2 cards.\n\nHowever, since the Boss Blind has 7 face-down cards, I won't see most of my deck anyway, making card removal less valuable. Alternatively, the Arcana Pack for $4 could grant a powerful Tarot card like Justice or Strength immediately. I could also save the money and enter the Boss Blind with $4 plus interest. The blind requires 1600 chips with 7 hidden cards - a tough challenge. Playing Three of a Kind with three face cards would give me 70 chips and 7 mult as the base, plus additional chips from the cards themselves. upgrades (Strength) or other beneficial effects. Since I already have The Tower for creating Stone Cards with +50 chips, the Arcana Pack would give me additional tools to strengthen my hand further. This seems like the optimal choice for tackling this challenging Boss Blind.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
