{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $15\n- Just bought Half Joker for $5\n\n## Inventory\n- Jokers (3/6 slots):\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult (gains X0.1 per planet card used) - has +1 joker slot\n  3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n- Consumables (1/2 slots):\n  1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n\n## Shop Offers\nCards:\n1. Spare Trousers - +2 Mult per Two Pair (currently +0) - $6\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n2. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n## Strategy Analysis\n\nMy current joker setup is excellent for Three of a Kind with face cards:\n- Base: 50 chips, 5 mult\n- Three face cards: +30 chips\n- Smiley Face: +15 mult (3 face cards × +5)\n- Half Joker: +20 mult (if 3 cards)\n- Constellation: ×1.1 mult\n- Total: 80 chips × (5 + 15 + 20) × 1.1 = 80 × 44 = 3,520 chips!\n\nThis is very strong. Now let me consider my options:\n\n**Hieroglyph ($10):**\n\n\nCutting one ante would reduce the total from 8 to 7, making the run significantly easier to complete. The tradeoff is losing a hand per round, dropping from 4 to 3, but my joker synergy is so potent that I might not need the extra flexibility. This could be the deciding factor for winning.\n\n**Spare Trousers ($6):**\nThis only triggers on Two Pair, which is a Level 1 hand that doesn't fit my Three of a Kind strategy. Building mult through repeated plays would be too slow given my current focus.\n\n**Standard Pack ($4):**\nAdding enhanced cards could help, though the immediate value isn't as clear as the voucher option.\n\n**Arcana Pack ($4):**\nTarot cards might enhance my deck, but it's uncertain what I'd actually get.\n\n**Reroll ($5):**\nCould reveal better jokers or planets for Constellation, but it's a gamble.\n\nWith $15 available, I'm weighing Hieroglyph against buying both packs or combining a pack with a reroll. Hieroglyph stands out as the strongest play—skipping an entire ante level is a massive structural advantage that outweighs the hand reduction, especially given how well my current joker synergies are performing.\n\nMy setup already generates 3,000+ chips from a single Three of a Kind with face cards, so losing one hand per round won't significantly impact my ability to clear blinds. I'm going with Hieroglyph.","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
