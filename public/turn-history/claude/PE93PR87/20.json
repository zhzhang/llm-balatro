{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $8\n- Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1 Mult currently, gains X0.1 per planet used, +1 joker slot (negative edition)\n- Max Jokers: 6 (because of Constellation's negative edition)\n\n## Shop Options\n1. Luchador - $5 (Sell to disable current Boss Blind)\n2. The Tower - $3 (Enhances 1 card into Stone Card: +50 chips)\n3. Celestial Pack - $4 (Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards)\n4. Wasteful - $10 (Permanently +1 discard each round)\n5. Reroll - $5\n\n## Strategy Analysis\n\nI have $8 available. My recent hands have been:\n- Two Pair - 600 chips\n- Full House - 552 chips  \n- Three of a Kind - 189/180 chips\n\nI'm entering Ante 2, which will have higher chip requirements. My current jokers are:\n1. Smiley Face - synergizes with face cards\n2. Constellation - scales with Planet cards, currently at X1 Mult\n\nKey considerations:\n- Constellation benefits from using Planet cards, so buying Celestial Pack ($4) would both level up a hand AND increase Constellation's multiplier\n- I have Full House at Level 3 already, which is strong\n- Two Pair and Three of a Kind are both Level 1\n\nThe most synergistic play would be to buy the Celestial Pack for $4. This would:\n1. Level up one of my frequently played hands (Two Pair, Three of a Kind, or Full House)\n2. Increase Constellation's multiplier from X1 to X1.1\n\n\n3. Still leave me with $4 to spend\n\nWith the remaining $4, I could grab The Tower for $3 to add +50 chips to a card, leaving $1 unspent. Other options include buying Luchador first for boss protection, then The Tower, or just holding the extra cash. Since Constellation directly scales with planets and my hands need strengthening for the higher ante, the Celestial Pack is the clear priority.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
