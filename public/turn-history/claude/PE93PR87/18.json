{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (just completed Ante 1)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $12\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per face card scored)\n\n## Shop Analysis\n**Cards:**\n1. Luchador - $5 (Sell to disable current Boss Blind)\n2. The Tower - $3 (Enhances 1 card into Stone Card: +50 chips, no rank/suit)\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Celestial Pack - $4 (Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards)\n2. Buffoon Pack - $4 (Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards)\n\n**Voucher:**\n1. Wasteful - $10 (Permanently +1 discard each round)\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $5\n\n## Strategy Analysis\n\nI'm now entering Ante 2, which means chip requirements will increase significantly. Let me consider my options:\n\n1. **Buy Luchador ($5)** - This can disable a future boss blind, which could be very valuable for difficult bosses. However, it takes up a joker slot.\n\n2. **Buy The Tower ($3)** - Stone cards give +50 chips with no rank/suit. This could be useful, but I need to think about which cards to enhance.\n\n3. **Buy Celestial Pack ($4)** - This gives me a Planet card to level up a hand type. Given that I've been playing Two Pair, Three of a Kind, and Full House, leveling one of these could be beneficial.\n\n4. **Buy Buffoon Pack ($4)** - Get another joker, which could synergize with my current strategy.\n\n5. **Buy Wasteful ($10)** - More discards is always good, but it costs almost all my money.\n\n\n6. **Reroll ($5)** - See what else is available.\n\nLooking at my recent hands, Two Pair scored 600 chips, Full House 552, and Three of a Kind around 180-189. My Smiley Face joker works well with face cards, and I've been leveraging that effectively. The Buffoon Pack seems most promising—another joker could substantially increase my scoring, leaving me $8 to grab The Tower or preserve funds for future rounds.\n\nI could alternatively level up Two Pair or Full House through a Celestial Pack, or combine The Tower with Buffoon Pack for $7 total, which would let me convert a card to Stone while adding a new joker. Wasteful would give more discards but costs $10, leaving minimal flexibility.\n\nSince I'm moving into Ante 2 and need stronger scaling, the Buffoon Pack is the priority—jokers generate consistent value across all hands and create better synergies than single-hand upgrades.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
