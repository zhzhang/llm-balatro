{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $20\n- I just beat the Ante 2 Boss Blind\n\n## Inventory\n- Jokers:\n  1.

Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n## Strategy Analysis\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Full House: Level 3, 90 chips, 8 mult (my best hand)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, 50 chips, 5 mult (just used successfully)\n- Two Pair: Level 1, 20 chips, 2 mult\n\nMy joker synergy:\n- Smiley Face works great with face card hands\n- Constellation needs planet cards to scale\n- I have 6 max joker slots thanks to Constellation's negative edition\n\n## Evaluating Shop Options\n\n**Half Joker ($5):**\n\n\nThis could multiply my Three of a Kind significantly—playing just three face cards would give me 50 chips × (5 base + 20 from Half Joker + 15 from Smiley) × 1.1 = roughly 2,200 chips. The tight hand size requirement actually synergizes well with my current setup since I'm already using smaller hands effectively.\n\n**Spare Trousers ($6):**\n-\n\nTwo Pair scaling is too slow since it's only Level 1 and not my primary hand type, so I'd need many plays to build value. Hieroglyph's ante reduction is tempting but costs $10 and cuts my hands per round from 4 to 3, which hurts flexibility. Standard Pack and Arcana Pack both offer decent card enhancements at $4 each, though neither provides immediate impact like the Half Joker does.\n\nI'm leaning toward Half Joker first since it directly boosts my Three of a Kind strategy that's been performing well. With $15 remaining, Hieroglyph becomes the key decision—reducing antes to 7 total is significant for run completion, and I can adapt to having only 3 hands if my joker synergies are strong enough. The reroll option exists if I want to explore other paths, but the ante reduction feels like the right long-term play. or if there are planets available to boost Constellation. Half Joker seems like the strongest immediate play for my Three of a Kind strategy, and I don't see any planets in the shop anyway. I'll prioritize that purchase first.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
