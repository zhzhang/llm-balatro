{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- In PLANET_PACK phase (choosing from a Celestial Pack)\n- Current Money: $4\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per played face card)\n- Full House is Level 2: 65 base chips, 6 base mult\n- I need to beat the Boss Blind next: 600 chips needed, with the effect \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\"\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips (Level 1 → Level 2)\n2. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips (Level 1 → Level 2)\n3. Earth - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips (Level 2 → Level 3)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just beat the Big Blind with a Full House that scored 552 chips. The upcoming Boss Blind needs 600 chips and will discard 2 random cards per hand played.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Neptune (Straight Flush)**: Would take Straight Flush from Level 1 (100 chips, 8 mult) to Level 2 (140 chips, 12 mult). Straight flushes are very hard to make and unreliable, especially with the boss discarding 2 cards per hand.\n\n2. **Pluto (High Card)**: Would take High Card from Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult) to Level 2 (15 chips, 2 mult). High Card is the weakest hand type and even leveled up won't help me reach 600 chips.\n\n3. **Earth (Full House)**: Would take Full House from Level 2 (65 chips, 6 mult) to Level 3 (90 chips, 8 mult). \n\nFull House is my reliable hand that's already working well. Upgrading it to Level 3 gives me 90 base chips and 8 mult. With a typical hand of three 5s and two 6s (27 chips from card values), I'd score around 117 × 8 = 936 chips, which comfortably beats the 600 chip requirement.\n\nEven accounting for the boss discarding 2 cards per round, Full House remains achievable since I only need 5 specific cards and start with 8 in hand. Earth is the clear choice—it strengthens my most consistent hand type and guarantees I'll exceed the threshold.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
