{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (Boss Blind stage)\n- In BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Current Money: $4\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per played face card)\n- Full House is Level 3: 90 base chips, 8 base mult\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, discards 2 random cards per hand played\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at the Blind Select phase for the Boss Blind. Boss blinds cannot be skipped, so my only option is to play the round.\n\nMy Full House is at Level 3 with 90 base chips and 8 base mult. Let me calculate the expected score:\n\nIf I play a typical Full House with three 5s and two 6s:\n- Base chips: 90\n- Card chips from the 5 cards: 5+5+5+6+6 = 27\n- Total chips: 117\n- Base mult: 8\n- Total score: 117 × 8 = 936 chips\n\nThis is well above the 600 chips needed, even with the boss effect of discarding 2 random cards per hand.\n\nThe boss effect is concerning - it discards 2 random cards per hand played. This means:\n- I start with 8 cards in hand\n- After playing one hand, I'll have 8 - 5 (cards played) - 2 (discarded by boss) = 1 card left\n- This makes it difficult to play multiple hands\n\nHowever, I should be able to form a Full House on my first hand and score well above 600 chips to win in one play.\n\nSince Boss blinds cannot be skipped and I must play this round, the only available action is to use the play_round command.","action":"\"play_round\""}
