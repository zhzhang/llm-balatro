{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SPECTRAL_PACK\n- Current Money: $10\n- Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult (gains X0.1 mult per planet card used)\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n- Max Consumables: 2\n\n## Spectral Pack Choices\n1. Talisman - Add a Gold Seal (Earn $3 when this card is played and scores)\n2. Trance - Add a Blue Seal (Creates the Planet card for final played poker hand of round if held in hand)\n\n## Current Hand\n1. Ace of Spades - +11 chips\n2. 6 of Spades - +6 chips\n3. King of Hearts - +10 chips\n4. King of Clubs - +10 chips\n5. 7 of Clubs - +7 chips\n6. Ace of Diamonds - +11 chips\n7. 8 of Diamonds - +8 chips\n8. 5 of Diamonds - +5 chips\n\n## Key Considerations\n\nI'm about to face the Boss Blind which requires 1600 chips. The boss effect is \"Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\" - but since I skipped both Small and Big blinds, NO cards have been played this Ante, so all my cards will be at full strength.\n\nLet me analyze the two spectral options:\n\n### Talisman (Gold Seal)\n- Adds $3 per card when played and scored\n- This is pure economic value\n- Good for cards I'll play frequently\n- Given I need to beat 1600 chips, money is less important right now than raw power\n\n\n- Trance creates a planet card whenever I hold the sealed card and finish a round, which directly feeds my Constellation joker's multiplier scaling. Since planet cards also level up hand types for bonus chips and mult, I can generate free scaling repeatedly. This synergy is far superior to the flat economic gain from Talisman.\n\nFor placement, I need a card I'll naturally hold rather than play—something that won't compromise my hand strength against the Boss Blind. Looking at my options, the low cards (5, 6, 7, 8) are ideal candidates since I'll likely keep them out of my final hand anyway when playing pairs or two pair with my Aces and Kings.\n\nThe 5 of Diamonds stands out as the best choice—it's the weakest card in my hand, so holding it won't affect my ability to make strong combinations. I'll apply the Blue Seal there to consistently generate planet cards each round.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,8]"}
