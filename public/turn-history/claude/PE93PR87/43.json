{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $0\n- Next blind: Boss Blind requiring 1600 chips with 7 cards face down\n\n## Current Inventory\nJokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.2 Mult\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n\nConsumables:\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank/suit)\nMax Consumables: 2 (1 free slot)\n\nTags:\n1. Investment Tag - After defeating Boss Blind, gain $25\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. The Hanged Man - Destroys up to 2 selected cards - $3\n2. Certificate - When round begins, add random playing card with random seal to hand - $6\n\nBoosters: None\nVouchers: None\nReroll cost: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nI have $0, so I cannot buy anything from the shop. I cannot reroll either since that costs $5.\n\nLooking at the previous actions:\n- Turn 41: I used Venus to level up Three of a Kind\n- Turn 42: I bought the Arcana Pack for $4\n- Turn 43: I selected The Lovers and enhanced the Queen of Diamonds into a Wild Card\n\nNow I'm back in the shop with $0. The only option I have is to proceed to the round select screen since I cannot afford any purchases.\n\nThe Boss Blind requires 1600 chips. Looking at my hand from Turn 43, I had:\n- King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n- Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n- 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n- 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n\n\n- Queen of Diamonds (now Wild Card after using The Lovers)\n- 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n- 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n- 8 of Diamonds (+8 diamonds)\n\nSince the Queen is now a Wild Card, I can form a Heart flush using King, Jack, 10, 7 of Hearts plus the Queen, which gives me a flush with three face cards scoring. The base flush provides 35 chips and 4x multiplier, with the face cards adding 10 chips each and Smiley Face providing +5 mult per face card.\n\nCalculating the total: 35 base chips plus 47 from the cards equals 82 chips, then multiplied by the 19x multiplier (4 base plus 15 from Smiley Face) and boosted by Constellation's 1.2x modifier, reaching approximately 1870 chips—well above the 1600 requirement. With no funds available, I'll move forward to round_select.","action":"\"round_select\""}
