{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Blind: Small (2000 chips needed)\n- Current Money: $3\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 2\n- Current chips: 0\n\n## Current Hand\n1. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n2. King of Clubs (+10 chips, X2 Mult, Glass Card) - face card\n3. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n5. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips) - face card\n6. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n8. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips) - Creates Planet card for final played poker hand if held in hand\n\n## Jokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.3 Mult\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n4. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if played hand contains Three of a Kind\n\n## Analysis:\n- Pair of 10s (10 of Clubs position 3, 10 of Diamonds position 6)\n- Two face cards: King of Clubs (position 2) and Jack of Diamonds (position 5)\n- King of Clubs is a Glass Card (X2 Mult)\n- Still no Three of a Kind\n\nThe 5 of Diamonds creates a Planet card for the final played poker hand if held in hand. This is useful to note for the end of the round.\n\n## Options:\n\n### Option 1: Play King, 10C, 10D (positions 2, 3, 6)\nThis gives us a pair with 3 cards, triggering Half Joker.\n\n\nScoring this hand: the pair yields 10 base chips and 2 mult. The three cards contribute 30 chips total (King at 10, both 10s at 10 each). The King's Glass Card doubles mult to 4, then Smiley Face adds 5 mult for the face card scored, bringing us to 9 mult before Constellation multiplies by 1.3 and Half Joker adds 20 mult.\n\nLet me work through the alternative: playing King, Jack, and one 10 creates a High Card instead. This five-chip, one-mult base hand also scores 30 chips from the three face/ten cards, but the different hand type changes the multiplier progression and triggers Half Joker differently.\n\nThe King's Glass card doubles to 2 mult, then Smiley adds 5 for 7 total. Jack's Smiley pushes it to 12, the 10 contributes nothing, Half Joker jumps it to 32, and Constellation multiplies by 1.3 to reach 41.6 mult. That's 35 chips times 41.6, which gives 1,456—still falling short of the 2,000 target.\n\nI could use my remaining discards to hunt for Three of a Kind instead, though the deck composition makes this risky. 't trigger. Playing King, Jack, and both 10s gives a Pair of 10s worth 50 chips base, but the multiplier only reaches 18.2x through the King's Glass card and Smiley bonuses, resulting in 910 chips total—significantly worse than other options. Playing just the King, one 10, and Jack seems more promising.\n\nTesting positions 2, 5, 6 with those three cards creates a High Card hand worth 35 chips. The multiplier builds differently here: King activates Glass X2 and Smiley, Jack adds another Smiley bonus, and crucially, Half Joker triggers for +20 to the multiplier, reaching 41.6x after Constellation. This yields 1,456 chips—a much stronger result.\n\nI'm still falling short of 2000 chips with limited hands remaining. Three of a Kind has been my most reliable scoring hand, so I should focus on building toward that. I'll keep the pair of 10s along with the King and Jack, discarding the other cards to maximize my chances of drawing a matching 10 or completing a different three-of-a-kind. With only 3 hands left, playing this current hand and hoping for better draws on subsequent plays seems like the right approach.\n\nI'll go with King, 10, Jack from positions 2, 5, 6.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,5,6]"}
