{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4 (note: I bought Hieroglyph which reduced antes from 8 to 7, so I'm effectively at 2/7)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $5\n\n## Blind Options\n1. **Small Blind**: 800 chips needed, reward $3, skip tag: Investment Tag (+$25 after beating Boss)\n2. **Big Blind**: 1200 chips needed, reward $4, skip tag: D6 Tag (rerolls start at $0)\n3. **Boss Blind**: 1600 chips needed, reward $5, description: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\"\n\n## My Inventory\n- Jokers (3/6 slots):\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult (gains X0.1 per planet card), +1 joker slot (negative edition)\n  3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n- Consumables (1/2 slots):\n  1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round (so I have 3 hands per round now)\n\n## My Strategy\nMy setup excels at Three of a Kind with face cards:\n- Base: 50 chips, 5 mult (Level 2)\n- Three face cards add: +30 chips\n- Smiley Face: +15 mult (3 face cards × +5)\n- Half Joker: +20 mult (3 cards total)\n- Constellation: ×1.1 mult\n- Total: 80 chips × (5 + 15 + 20) × 1.1 = 80 × 40 × 1.1 = 3,520 chips\n\n\n- This crushes both the Small and Big Blinds.\n\nThe Investment Tag is extremely valuable—$25 is substantial money. Skipping the Small Blind would secure it, but I can trivially beat 800 chips with my current hand. The real question is whether the guaranteed $25 from skipping outweighs the immediate $3 reward plus the flexibility of playing through the round.\n\nIf I skip, I forfeit the $3 but gain the Investment Tag, netting $22 extra after defeating the Boss. That's compelling. However, the Boss Blind presents a real obstacle: seven cards drawn face down means I won't know which ones are face cards, undermining my strategy. Having that extra $25 to spend on stronger jokers or planet cards afterward could be crucial for scaling up and handling the challenge.\n\nBut there's a catch—skipping means no shopping opportunity between Small Blind and the Boss. I'd need to beat Big Blind and then the Boss back-to-back with just my current $5, which isn't enough to buy anything meaningful anyway. The Investment Tag only pays out after I win, not before, so I'm committing to a harder path without intermediate resources.\n\nMy setup can handle all three blinds: Small (800), Big (1200), and Boss (1600 with the face-down penalty) are all manageable against my 3,520 chip potential. Playing Small Blind gives me the $3 reward plus interest, and crucially, I get a shopping phase before Big Blind. That flexibility matters more than the delayed $25 bonus.\n\nBut wait—that $25 from the Investment Tag is genuinely massive, equivalent to eight rounds of normal rewards. If I skip both Small and Big, I'd get the D6 Tag and face the Boss directly. Even with the face-down handicap, my current power level should handle it. The $25 spike would be transformative for my next shop phase.\n\nI'm going with **skip_round** to chase the Investment Tag.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
