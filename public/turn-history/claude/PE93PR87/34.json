{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $5\n- I have the Investment Tag which will give me $25 after beating the Boss Blind\n\n## Blind Options\n1. **Big Blind**: 1200 chips needed, reward $4, skip tag: D6 Tag (rerolls start at $0)\n2. **Boss Blind**: 1600 chips needed, reward $5, description: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\"\n\n## My Current Setup\nJokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult (gains X0.1 per planet card), +1 joker slot\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n\nConsumables:\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round (so I have 3 hands per round)\n\n## My Three of a Kind Strategy\n- Base: 50 chips, 5 mult (Level 2)\n- Three face cards: +30 chips (total 80 chips)\n- Smiley Face: +15 mult (3 face cards × +5)\n- Half Joker: +20 mult (if 3 cards)\n- Constellation: ×1.1 mult\n- Total: 80 × (5 + 15 + 20) × 1.1 = 80 × 40 × 1.1 = 3,520 chips\n\nThis easily beats both the Big Blind (1200 chips) and should handle the Boss Blind (1600 chips).\n\n## Decision Analysis\n\n\nSkipping the Big Blind nets me the D6 Tag for free rerolls next shop, but I lose the $4 and shopping opportunity before facing the Boss. Playing it gives me $9 total to spend, though the D6 Tag is valuable for finding better jokers or planet cards. The Boss Blind's face-down mechanic is concerning—having 7 cards hidden means I can't reliably score my face cards for Smiley Face's multiplier, which undermines my current strategy significantly.\n\nMy hand is solid enough to clear 1600 chips even with that handicap, so the real trade-off is whether free rerolls later outweigh preparing now. Since I'm already getting $25 from my Investment Tag after beating the Boss, the extra $4 from playing Big Blind feels less critical than having the D6 Tag to fine-tune my joker selection. The D6 Tag's free rerolls only activate in the shop after beating the Boss, not before it. If I skip the Big Blind, I'm going straight to the Boss fight with my current deck and no preparation opportunity—and that face-down card mechanic is risky. Playing the Big Blind gives me $4 plus interest to spend before facing the Boss, which is a safer approach. I'll play the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
