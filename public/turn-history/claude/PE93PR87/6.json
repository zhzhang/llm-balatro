{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- I'm in the PLANET_PACK selection phase\n- I need to choose 1 of 3 Planet cards to level up a hand type\n- I have $1 remaining\n- I have Smiley Face joker (gives +5 Mult per played face card)\n- I've been successfully playing Three of a Kind (played it twice)\n\n**Pack Choices:**\n1. Earth - Level up Full House (+2 Mult and +25 chips)\n2. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush (+4 Mult and +40 chips)\n3. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult and +15 chips)\n\n**What I need:**\n- Next is Big Blind requiring 450 chips\n- Then Boss Blind requiring 600 chips (discards 2 random cards per hand)\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nThe problem is that none of these planet cards level up Three of a Kind, which is the hand I've been playing successfully. Let me think about which of these options would be most useful:\n\n1. **Earth (Full House)**: Full House is a strong hand (pair + three of a kind). It's level 1 currently with 40 chips and 4 mult. If I level it up, it would become 65 chips and 6 mult (base). Full House is relatively easy to make if I have the right cards, and it scores higher than Three of a Kind naturally.\n\n2. **Neptune (Straight Flush)**: Straight Flush is very hard to make - requires 5 cards in sequence all of the same suit. It's currently 100 chips and 8 mult. While it would become 140 chips and 12 mult, the difficulty of making this hand makes it impractical for early game.\n\n3. **Mercury (Pair)**: Pair is the easiest hand to make and I can almost always make at least a pair. Currently 10 chips and 2 mult, would become 25 chips and 3 mult. \n\nThough it's simple to construct, the base scoring is weak. With Smiley Face boosting face cards, a pair of face cards would give me 45 chips and 13 mult for 585 total—just barely covering Big Blind. The other options offer more potential: Earth's Full House could reach higher scores with the right cards, while Neptune's Straight Flush, though difficult to assemble, would provide massive scoring if I manage to construct it. of a Kind within it, so it's a good progression. Full House is the natural upgrade from what I've been playing, and it'll work well with my current joker setup. I'm going with Earth.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
