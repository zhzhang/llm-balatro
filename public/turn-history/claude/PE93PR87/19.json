{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: BUFFOON_PACK\n- Current Money: $8\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per face card scored)\n- Max Jokers: 5\n\n## Pack Choices\nI need to choose one of two jokers:\n\n1. **8 Ball** (Common, Foil edition)\n   - 1 in 4 chance for each played 8 to create a Tarot card when scored\n   - +50 chips\n   - Foil edition gives +50 chips\n   \n2. **Constellation** (Uncommon, Negative edition)\n   - Gains X0.1 Mult every time a Planet card is used (Currently X1 Mult)\n   - +1 Joker slot (from Negative edition)\n   - Negative edition gives +1 joker slot\n\n## Analysis\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\n**8 Ball:**\n- Provides a flat +50 chips bonus\n- The foil edition adds another +50 chips, so total +100 chips\n- The ability to create Tarot cards is conditional on playing 8s and has only a 25% chance\n- My deck has 8s, but I'm not specifically targeting them in my strategy\n- This is a consistent chip boost but not particularly synergistic with my current strategy\n\n**Constellation:**\n- Starts at X1 Mult (which doesn't help initially)\n- Scales with Planet card usage - gains X0.1 Mult per planet\n- The Negative edition gives +1 joker slot, which is HUGE - it allows me to have 6 jokers instead of 5\n- This is a scaling joker that gets better over time\n- If I use 10 Planet cards, it becomes X2 Mult, which is very powerful\n\n\n- The extra joker slot is incredibly valuable for building synergies\n\nThe 8 Ball offers immediate +100 chips but remains static. Constellation starts weak but scales significantly with Planet usage. More importantly, the Negative edition's +1 joker slot is the real prize—it opens up room for additional jokers that can create powerful combinations. Even if Constellation's multiplier grows slowly, that extra slot alone justifies the pick. I could also pursue Celestial Packs at $4 to level up hands while feeding Constellation's scaling mechanic.\n\nWith Ante 2 ramping up difficulty and $8 still available, having 6 joker slots instead of 5 gives me a substantial edge. The long-term compounding potential outweighs the immediate value of 8 Ball.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
