{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- At BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Current Money: $1\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per played face card)\n- Full House is now Level 2: 65 base chips, 6 base mult\n- Three of a Kind is Level 1: 30 base chips, 3 base mult\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to decide whether to:\n1. Play the Big Blind (450 chips needed, reward $4)\n2. Skip the Big Blind to get Polychrome Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n\n**Upcoming:**\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, discards 2 random cards per hand, reward $5\n\n**Analysis of Playing Big Blind:**\n\nCan I beat 450 chips with my current setup?\n\nWith Full House Level 2 (65 base chips, 6 base mult) and Smiley Face:\n- If I play 3 face cards + 2 other cards for a Full House:\n  - Chips: 65 (base) + 10 per face card = 65 + 30 = 95 chips\n  - Mult: 6 (base) + 5 per face card = 6 + 15 = 21 mult\n  - Total: 95 × 21 = 1,995 chips\n\nEven with just Three of a Kind Level 1 (30 base chips, 3 base mult):\n- If I play 3 face cards:\n  - Chips: 30 (base) + 10 per face card = 30 + 30 = 60 chips\n  - Mult: 3 (base) + 5 per face card = 3 + 15 = 18 mult\n  - Total: 60 × 18 = 1,080 chips\n\nBoth hands comfortably exceed 450 chips, and I've already proven I can score 180+ with Three of a Kind in the Small Blind.\n\n**Analysis of Skipping:**\n\nIf I skip the Big Blind, I get Polychrome Tag which makes the next base edition shop Joker free and Polychrome (x1.5 mult multiplier). However, I'd miss the $4 reward and go straight to the Boss Blind at 600 chips without the chance to shop or build my deck further.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nPlaying through the Big Blind is the stronger move. I'll secure the $4 reward for a total of $5, maintain my remaining hands and discards for end-of-round interest, and approach the Boss Blind with better resources. The Polychrome Tag is tempting, but with only $1 to spend, I can't capitalize on most shop jokers anyway, and skipping the money now puts me at a disadvantage against the harder Boss Blind.\n\n**Decision: Play the Big Blind**","action":"\"play_round\""}
