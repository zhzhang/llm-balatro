{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the current state and choose from the Standard Pack options. Let me look at what's available:\n\n1. Jack of Spades (Lucky Card) - +10 chips, 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20. Also creates a Planet card for final played poker hand if held in hand.\n\n2. 8 of Hearts (Mult enhancement) - +8 chips, +4 Mult\n\n3. 4 of Diamonds - +4 chips. Creates the Planet card for final played poker hand if held in hand.\n\nCurrent strategy:\n- My main strategy is Three of a Kind\n- I have Wily Joker that gives +100 Chips for Three of a Kind\n- I have Half Joker that gives +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n- I have Smiley Face that gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n- I have Constellation at X1.3 Mult that scales with Planet cards\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Jack of Spades (Lucky Card)**:\n- It's a face card, so it synergizes with Smiley Face (+5 Mult when scored)\n- Lucky enhancement gives chances for bonus mult and money\n- Creates Planet cards when held - this synergizes AMAZINGLY with Constellation!\n- This is extremely valuable because:\n  1. Face card = Smiley Face synergy\n  2. Planet card generation = Constellation scaling\n  3. Lucky bonus is gravy on top\n\n**8 of Hearts (Mult enhancement)**:\n- Enhanced with Mult, so it gives +8 chips and +4 Mult when scored\n- This is good for raw scoring power\n- I already have an 8 in my deck (8 of Hearts and 8 of Diamonds were in my previous hand)\n- This could help me make Three of a Kind with 8s more consistently\n\n\n- The 4 of Diamonds also generates Planet cards but lacks the face card synergy and has minimal chip value. While the Planet generation helps Constellation, the Jack's combination of face card bonus, stronger base stats, and lucky enhancement makes it significantly more powerful.\n\nThe Jack of Spades is the clear winner here—it hits multiple synergies at once while the 8 of Hearts offers only direct scoring and the 4 is too weak to compete.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
