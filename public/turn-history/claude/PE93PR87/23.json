{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Boss Round coming up)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $1\n- Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into a Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank or suit)\n- Max Jokers: 6\n- Max Consumables: 2\n\n## Shop Options with $1\n- Luchador - $5 (can't afford)\n- Wasteful - $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n## Analysis\n\nI only have $1 left, which means I can't afford any of the shop items. My only real options are:\n1. Use The Tower consumable on a card before entering the round\n2. Sell The Tower for $1 (giving me $2 total)\n3. Just proceed to round_select\n\nSince this is Round 3 (Boss Round), I need to think about whether The Tower will help me. A Stone Card gives +50 chips but loses rank and suit, meaning it can't contribute to forming hands.\n\nLooking at my hand history:\n- Three of a Kind is my most played hand (Level 2, 50 chips, 5 mult)\n- Full House is Level 3 (90 chips, 8 mult)\n- Two Pair scored really well once (600 chips)\n\nThe key question: Should I use The Tower now or save it for during the round?\n\nActually, I should think about this more carefully. The Tower can be used during the round as well, not just in the shop. Since I'm in the shop phase, I could:\n1. Use it now on a card in my deck (but I don't know what cards are in my hand right now since this is the shop phase)\n\n\n2. Keep it and use it strategically during the Boss Round when I can see which card would be best to convert. This gives me flexibility to use it on a low-value card to boost chips without losing much hand-making potential, or deploy it when I'm close to the score threshold and need that extra +50 chips.\n\nSince I can't afford anything here, I'll proceed to the round and save The Tower for when I can see my actual hand and make the best decision about which card to enhance.","action":"\"round_select\""}
