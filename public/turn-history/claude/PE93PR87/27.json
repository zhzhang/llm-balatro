{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $10\n- Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n- Max Consumables: 2\n\n## Blind Select Info\nCurrent Blind: Boss\nChips Needed: 1600\nBoss Description: Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\nReward: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nI'm facing the Boss Blind which requires 1600 chips. The boss effect is \"Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\" - but since I skipped both Small and Big blinds, NO cards have been played this Ante, so all my cards will be at full strength!\n\nThis was the entire strategy - by skipping both Small and Big blinds, I've preserved all my cards for the Boss fight. Now I need to beat 1600 chips.\n\nLet me estimate what I can score:\n\n### My Hand Levels:\n- Full House: Level 3, 90 chips, 8 mult (best option)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, 50 chips, 5 mult\n- Two Pair: Level 1, 20 chips, 2 mult\n- Pair: Level 1, 10 chips, 2 mult\n\n### My Jokers:\n- Smiley Face: +5 mult per face card scored\n- Constellation: X1.1 mult\n\nLet me calculate what I can score with different hands:\n\n**Two Pair with Face Cards (2 Kings + 2 Aces):**\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult\n- Card chips: 10 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 42 chips (all 4 cards participate)\n\n\n- Total chips: 62, with 2 face cards adding 10 mult, bringing total mult to 12. This gives 62 × 12 = 744 chips, then 744 × 1.1 = 818 chips with Constellation. Still short of 1600.\n\n**Three of a Kind:**\nI need to see what cards are available when the round starts, as my current hand view doesn't show three matching ranks.\n\n**Full House:**\nThis is my strongest hand option at Level 3. If I can construct one with face cards included, the 90 base chips plus 8 mult multiplied by face card bonuses and Constellation should get me closer to the target.\n\nLet me calculate a full house scenario with 3 Kings and 2 Aces: 52 chips from the cards themselves, 142 total chips, and 5 face cards giving 25 mult. That's 142 × 33 = 4686 chips, then 4686 × 1.1 = 5154 chips. This far exceeds what I need.\n\nEven a more conservative full house with just 2 Kings and 3 lower cards would still work well.\n\nI also have The Tower consumable available to convert a card into a Stone Card for +50 chips if needed, though my calculations suggest I won't require it. Given these calculations, I'm confident enough to face the Boss Blind.\n\nMy advantages are clear: undebuffed cards since nothing's been played yet, strong synergy between Smiley Face and Constellation, a Level 3 Full House hand, and multiple remaining hands and discards to leverage. The Tower serves as a safety net if anything goes wrong. I'm ready to play.","action":"\"play_round\""}
