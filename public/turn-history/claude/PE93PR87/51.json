{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- Just got Earth planet card from The High Priestess pack\n\n## Current Inventory\nJokers (4/6):\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.2 Mult (gains X0.1 per Planet card used) - Negative edition\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n4. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n\nConsumables (2/2 - FULL):\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n2. Earth - Levels up Full House (+2 Mult and +25 chips)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Wasteful - +1 discard per round\n2. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand per round\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Sly Joker - +50 Chips if played hand contains a Pair - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - $4\n\nReroll cost: $6\n\n## Analysis\n\nI have $7 left and my consumables are now FULL (2/2). \n\nCurrent hand levels:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 base chips, 7 base mult) - My main strategy\n- Full House: Level 3 (90 base chips, 8 base mult)\n\nI got the Earth planet card which levels up Full House. Since I already have it, I should consider:\n\n1. **Use Earth immediately** - This would:\n   - Level up Full House to Level 4 (115 base chips, 10 base mult)\n   - Increase Constellation to X1.3 Mult\n   - Free up a consumable slot\n   - Full House contains a Three of a Kind, so Wily Joker would still trigger\n\n2. **Use The Tower** - This would enhance a card into Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank or suit). But I don't have hand cards visible right now in shop phase.\n\n3. **Buy Sly Joker** ($3) - Adds +50 chips for pairs, but this isn't my main strategy\n\n4. **Buy Standard Pack** ($4) - Could get better cards for my deck\n\n5. **Reroll** ($6) - Could find better shop options, though I'm running low on funds\n\n.\n\n6. **Round Select** - Move on to the next round\n\nSince my consumables are full and I just got Earth, I should use it to level up Full House and boost Constellation's multiplier, which frees up space for future consumables. Full House is already Level 3 and it's a strong hand that still triggers Wily Joker. After using Earth, I'll have 1 consumable slot free and $7 remaining, so I could grab a Standard Pack for $4 to improve my deck or save for the next round.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
