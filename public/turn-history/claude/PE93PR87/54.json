{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6 (in SHOP phase)\n- Current Money: $3\n- Just selected Jack of Spades (Lucky Card) from Standard Pack\n\n## Inventory\nJokers (4/6):\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.3 Mult (gains X0.1 per Planet card used) - Negative edition\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n4. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n\nConsumables (1/2):\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Wasteful - +1 discard per round\n2. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Sly Joker - +50 Chips if played hand contains a Pair - $3\n\nNo Boosters\nNo Vouchers\nReroll cost: $6 (but I only have $3)\n\n## Analysis\n\nI have $3 remaining. My options are:\n\n1. **Buy Sly Joker** ($3) - This would give me +50 chips for pairs. However:\n   - My main strategy is Three of a Kind, not pairs\n   - I've only played 2 pairs in the entire run\n   - Wily Joker already gives +100 chips for Three of a Kind\n   - This doesn't align with my current strategy\n   - Would leave me with $0\n\n2. **Reroll** - Can't afford it ($6 cost, only have $3)\n\n3. **Proceed to next round** - Move on with current setup\n   - I just added Jack of Spades (Lucky Card) to my deck\n   - The face card works perfectly with Smiley Face and generates Planet cards for Constellation scaling\n   - I'll retain my $3 and potentially earn interest at round end\n\nMy core strategy centers on Three of a Kind hands, which have performed well throughout this run. Full House is now Level 4 and provides strong scoring. The Jack of Spades synergizes excellently with my existing jokers, particularly the face card multiplier and Planet card generation. Sly Joker doesn't fit this approach—I've barely used pairs and my jokers are already optimized for my actual playstyle.\n\nKeeping my remaining funds lets me stay flexible for future purchases while maintaining focus on what's working. Moving forward with the improved deck and proceeding to the next round.","action":"\"round_select\""}
