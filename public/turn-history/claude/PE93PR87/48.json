Looking at my hand history, I've played Three of a Kind 4 times, which is my most common hand type. This makes Wily Joker extremely valuable for my current strategy!\n\nLet me calculate potential scoring with Wily Joker:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 base chips, 7 base mult)\n\n\n- With typical 3 cards (say three 3s = 9 chips): 70 + 9 = 79 chips\n- Wily Joker adds: +100 chips = 179 chips\n- Half Joker adds: +20 mult = 27 mult\n- Constellation multiplies: 27 × 1.2 = 32.4 mult\n- Total: 179 × 32.4 = 5,801.6 chips\n\nThis is a massive improvement! Wily Joker synergizes perfectly with my most-played hand type. Sly Joker doesn't offer the same value since pairs come up far less frequently in my play pattern.\n\nThe Jumbo Arcana Pack could unlock useful Tarot cards like additional Towers for card enhancements. For Ante 3, I need to focus on pushing chip output past the 4500-5500 range required by Boss Blinds while maintaining my Three of a Kind foundation. Planet cards might also help level up hands and strengthen Constellation's multiplier effect.\n\nWith $17 available, Wily Joker ($4) is a clear priority given its synergy, and the Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6) offers potential value, leaving $7 for flexibility. I should evaluate whether this allocation actually maximizes my progression or if there's a better approach.\n\nWily Joker is the obvious first purchase since it directly amplifies my strongest hand. I'll commit to that move.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
