{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, just beat Small Blind\n- Current Money: $9\n- No jokers or consumables yet\n- In the SHOP phase\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Mystic Summit (Joker) - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining - $5\n2. Uranus (Planet) - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips - $3\n3. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards - $4\n4. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately - $4\n5. Magic Trick (Voucher) - Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10 (can't afford)\n6. Reroll cost: $5\n\n**What I need to consider:**\n- Next blind is Big Blind requiring 450 chips\n- After that is Boss Blind requiring 600 chips (discards 2 random cards per hand)\n- I've been successfully using Three of a Kind (played it twice)\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n\n1. **Mystic Summit ($5)** - This gives +15 Mult when you have 0 discards remaining. This is a conditional joker that only works if I use all my discards. It's decent but not amazing for early game. If I buy this, I'll have $4 left.\n\n2. **Uranus ($3)** - Levels up Two Pair. I haven't been playing Two Pair much (played Three of a Kind twice). This doesn't seem like the best fit for my current strategy, though it's cheap.\n\n3. **Buffoon Pack ($4)** - This gives me a choice between 2 jokers. This is good value - I get to see 2 options and pick the better one. If I buy this, I'll have $5 left, which I could then use to buy Mystic Summit if I want.\n\n\n4. **Celestial Pack ($4)** - Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards. Since Three of a Kind has been working well, leveling it up could be valuable. The Buffoon Pack gives me more joker options though, which might be more important for building momentum. Rerolling for $5 could reveal better combinations, but I'm already seeing decent choices.\n\n**Strategy considerations:**\n- I have $9 total to spend\n- Big Blind needs 450 chips (50% more than Small's 300)\n- Boss Blind needs 600 chips and has the nasty \"discards 2 random cards per hand\" effect\n- I need to start building a joker engine\n\nThe Buffoon Pack seems like the strongest play. For $4, I get to choose from 2 jokers, which guarantees I'll add something useful to my deck. That leaves me $5 to either grab Mystic Summit for a guaranteed joker with +15 Mult, or explore other options. The guaranteed joker from Mystic Summit is tempting since it scales well with careful discard management, but the flexibility of seeing multiple joker options first with the Buffoon Pack feels like the better starting move.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
