{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $12\n- I have Investment Tag which will give me $25 after beating the Boss Blind\n\n## Upcoming Challenge\n- Next blind is Boss Blind\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Boss Description: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\"\n- This means 7 of my 8 cards will be face down, making it hard to identify which cards to play\n\n## Current Inventory\nJokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult, +1 joker slot (negative edition)\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n\nConsumables:\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank/suit)\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. The Hanged Man (Tarot) - Destroys up to 2 selected cards - $3\n2. Certificate (Joker) - When round begins, add random playing card with random seal to hand - $6\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n2. Mega Arcana Pack - Choose 2 of up to 5 Tarot cards - $8\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe Boss Blind with 7 face-down cards is a major challenge because:\n1. I won't be able to see most of my cards\n2. My Smiley Face joker relies on playing face cards, which I won't be able to identify\n3. This makes it very difficult to form specific hands\n\nHowever, I still have strategic options:\n- My Half Joker gives +20 Mult for 3 or fewer cards, which doesn't require seeing the cards\n\n\n- I can work with just the one visible card and play blindly\n- Constellation's X1.1 multiplier applies regardless of what I can see\n\nTesting if I can reach 1600 chips: playing 3 cards unseen with an Ace visible gives roughly 16 base chips, multiplied by 21 from Half Joker and Constellation, which falls short. I need to find a way to boost my chip generation significantly—either through better card selection in the shop or by using consumables strategically. 6) - Adds a random card with seal to hand each round. This could help, but it's random.\n2. The Hanged Man ($3) - Destroys cards. Not immediately useful for the Boss fight.\n3. Arcana Pack ($4) - Could get useful Tarot cards\n4. Mega Arcana Pack ($8) - Better value, 2 cards from 5 options\n\nThe Mega Arcana Pack seems like the best option because I can get 2 Tarot cards that could enhance my deck, Planet cards would level up hand types for future rounds, and Enhancement cards like Glass or Mult Cards could boost my scoring. I have $12, so I can afford it and still have $4 left. After buying the Mega Arcana Pack, I'd have $4 left to potentially reroll if I don't find good options, but that would leave me with negative money.\n\nThe boss blind mechanic is concerning though—7 cards are face down, meaning I can only see 1 out of 8. This severely limits my ability to build hands strategically. Given this constraint, the Mega Arcana Pack still offers the most flexibility since I can get enhancements or planet cards that work regardless of which cards I draw. I'll go with that purchase.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
