Ante 3 will be harder, so I need to prepare well.\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - my most played hand\n- Full House: Level 3 (90 chips, 8 mult)\n- Most other hands are Level 1\n\nMy joker setup is:\n- Smiley Face synergizes with face cards\n\n\n- Constellation scales with Planet cards\n- Half Joker rewards small hands (3 or fewer cards)\n\nSplash Joker is tempting since it lets all played cards contribute chips to the score, even outside of hand formations. The +50 chips base value plus Foil's +4 chips bonus makes it a solid chip generator. However, I need to consider whether this fits my current strategy better than other options like Lusty Joker, which would add multiplier through Heart suits.\n\nStandard Pack could introduce a useful card to my deck, while Jumbo Arcana Pack offers Tarot enhancements. Wasteful Voucher would increase my discard count from 4 to 5 per round, giving me more flexibility in hand selection.\n\nAs I move into Ante 3 with tougher blinds, I need to prioritize scoring power. Splash Joker's ability to make every card count toward chips is particularly appealing for scaling my overall damage output. So if I play 5 cards with Splash, they all score but Half Joker won't activate—that's the trade-off. With just 3 cards, Splash still helps and Half Joker triggers, though the three cards might already be scoring anyway if they form the hand type.\n\nSplash feels less impactful with Three of a Kind since those cards are already contributing. Wasteful could be better for flexibility—more discards mean better odds of assembling strong hands. The Jumbo Arcana Pack is also tempting since I have unused Tarot cards and room in my consumable slots.\n\nFor Ante 3, I need to significantly boost my chip output. Planet cards would level up my hands and scale Constellation, while Tarot cards could enhance my deck. I'm leaning toward the Arcana Pack for $6, then Wasteful for $10, leaving me $16 remaining from my $32 budget. That gives me cushion for rerolls or other upgrades.\n\nBut I should evaluate the full shop first. Splash at $5 could be powerful for chip scaling, though it conflicts with Half Joker. Lusty Joker might work if I pivot to Hearts, but my current deck doesn't support that well. The Arcana Pack seems like the safest choice to unlock new enhancement options and see what Tarot cards become available.\n\nI'll prioritize Wasteful for the permanent discard flexibility, then grab the Arcana Pack. That leaves me with $16 to adapt based on what I discover.","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
