{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $10 (just got the Garbage Tag bonus)\n- Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1.1 Mult\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n\n## Blind Select Decision\n\n**Current Blind: Big Blind**\n- Chips Needed: 1200\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Ethereal Tag (gives free Spectral Pack)\n\n**Upcoming Blind: Boss**\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Boss Description: \"Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\"\n- Reward: $5\n\n## Key Analysis\n\nThe boss blind effect is crucial: \"Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed.\"\n\nSince I skipped the Small Blind, I haven't played any cards this Ante yet. This means:\n- If I play Big Blind, those cards will be debuffed in the Boss blind\n- If I skip Big Blind too, ALL my cards will be fresh for the Boss blind\n\nThe question is: Can I beat the Boss blind with 1600 chips needed?\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Full House: Level 3, 90 chips, 8 mult\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, 50 chips, 5 mult\n\nWith my jokers:\n- Smiley Face: +5 mult per face card scored\n- Constellation: X1.1 mult\n\nLet me estimate what I can score:\n\n**Full House example:**\n- Base: 90 chips × 8 mult = 720 chips\n- Add face cards (say 3 face cards): +5 mult × 3 = +15 mult total, so 23 mult\n\n\n- 90 chips × 23 mult = 2070 chips\n- Then × 1.1 from Constellation = 2277 chips\n\nThat's strong! But the debuff mechanic matters here. If I play specific cards in Big Blind, those exact cards lose their chip values when debuffed in the Boss blind. However, they still count toward hand formation. Since I have a full deck available, I could use different cards in each blind to avoid the debuff penalty entirely.\n\nThe Ethereal Tag offers a free Spectral Pack, which provides powerful card or joker modifications. This is genuinely valuable. I'm weighing whether the $4 reward from Big Blind justifies using up cards that could be debuffed, versus skipping it to preserve my full deck and gain the Spectral Pack instead. With $10 already in hand, I have flexibility for shop purchases. The Spectral Pack could unlock significant transformations that might matter more than the immediate cash.\n\nThe real advantage of skipping is that the Boss blind's debuff applies to any cards played in either Small or Big blind—so by avoiding both, I keep my entire deck at full strength for the final encounter. I need 1600 chips to beat it. A Full House with fresh cards gives me 90 base chips plus individual card values, which could potentially reach the threshold if I can maximize my hand composition.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
