{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- Just used Earth planet card, which leveled up Full House to Level 4 and increased Constellation to X1.3 Mult\n\n## Current Inventory\nJokers (4/6):\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Constellation - X1.3 Mult (gains X0.1 per Planet card used) - Negative edition\n3. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n4. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n\nConsumables (1/2):\n1. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Wasteful - +1 discard per round\n2. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Sly Joker - +50 Chips if played hand contains a Pair - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - $4\n\nReroll cost: $6\n\n## Hand Levels\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 base chips, 7 base mult) - My main strategy\n- Full House: Level 4 (115 base chips, 10 base mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 base chips, 2 base mult)\n\n## Analysis\n\nI have $7 left. Let me consider my options:\n\n1. **Buy Sly Joker** ($3) - Adds +50 chips for pairs. This could be useful as a fallback since I've played Two Pair twice. However, my main strategy is Three of a Kind, and I already have strong jokers.\n\n\n2. **Buy Standard Pack** ($4) - Could help me assemble Three of a Kind more reliably by selecting specific cards that match. 3. **Reroll** ($6) - Leaves me with just $1, which is risky but might surface better options than what's currently available. 4. **Proceed with current setup** - Move forward with $7 intact and earn interest ($1 per $5 = $1 gain) at round's end. My Three of a Kind strategy is solid with Wily Joker providing strong chip scaling, and I'm already building momentum with leveled hands.\n\nThe Standard Pack purchase makes the most sense here. I'm on Ante 3/8 Round 6 with a working strategy—my last boss hand scored 2,243.6 chips. My joker lineup (Constellation for scaling, Half Joker for utility, Smiley Face for face cards) supports consistent Three of a Kind plays. Buying the pack would let me cherry-pick cards that either duplicate existing ones or add face cards to strengthen Smiley Face synergy. With $3 remaining after the purchase, I could potentially grab the Sly Joker for $3, leaving me positioned for the next round.\n\nBut the Sly Joker doesn't align with my current gameplan—I'm already leaning heavily into Three of a Kind with Wily Joker providing the chip boost, and Pairs are just a secondary option. Better to keep the $3 and move forward rather than dilute my focus.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
