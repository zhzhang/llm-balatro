{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (just beat Small Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $5\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per played face card)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Mystic Summit (Joker) - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining - $5\n2. Uranus (Planet) - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips - $3\n3. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards to use immediately - $4\n4. Magic Trick (Voucher) - Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10 (can't afford)\n5. Reroll cost: $5\n\n**What's Next:**\n- Big Blind requires 450 chips\n- Boss Blind requires 600 chips and discards 2 random cards per hand\n- I've been playing Three of a Kind successfully\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nWith $5, I can afford:\n1. Mystic Summit for $5 (leaves me with $0)\n2. Uranus for $3 (leaves me with $2)\n3. Celestial Pack for $4 (leaves me with $1)\n4. Reroll for $5 (leaves me with $0)\n\n**Option 1: Mystic Summit ($5)**\n- Gives +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n- This is conditional but strong\n- Combined with Smiley Face, I'd have two mult-boosting jokers\n- Requires using all my discards strategically\n- This would leave me with $0\n\n**Option 2: Uranus ($3)**\n- Levels up Two Pair\n- I haven't been playing Two Pair at all (played Three of a Kind twice)\n- Doesn't fit my current strategy\n\n\n- Leaves me with $2\n\n**Option 3: Celestial Pack ($4)**\n- Lets me pick one of three Planet cards immediately\n- Three of a Kind is my proven hand, so leveling it would strengthen my approach for upcoming blinds\n- Leaves me with $1\n\n**Option 4: Reroll ($5)**\n- Might reveal better jokers, though Smiley Face is solid\n- Risky since I could end up with weaker options\n- Leaves me with $0\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe Big Blind needs 450 chips, which is significantly higher than what I've faced so far.\n\nThe Boss Blind requires 600 chips and discards 2 cards each hand, making it substantially tougher. Mystic Summit's conditional +15 Mult only triggers when I have no discards remaining, which could be valuable but unreliable. Leveling Three of a Kind through the Celestial Pack seems more straightforward—it's a hand I'm already using effectively. With Three of a Kind at Level 1 and face cards boosted by Smiley Face, I can estimate reaching the chip requirements, but upgrading the hand itself would give me more consistent scaling. d. I could also grab **Mystic Summit** for $5 to stack another mult booster with Smiley Face, though it only triggers when I've exhausted my discards.\n\nComparing the two: Celestial Pack permanently strengthens Three of a Kind, my most reliable hand, while Mystic Summit adds conditional mult. The permanent improvement feels more valuable for scaling into tougher blinds, plus I'd still have $1 left over. I'll go with **Celestial Pack**.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
