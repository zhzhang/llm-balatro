{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK\n- Current Money: $4\n- Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - gives +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Constellation - X1 Mult currently, gains X0.1 per planet used\n\n## Planet Pack Choices\nI need to choose one of three planet cards:\n\n1. **Neptune** - Level up Straight Flush: +4 Mult and +40 chips\n   - Current: Level 1, Base Chips 100, Base Mult 8\n   - After: Level 2, Base Chips 140, Base Mult 12\n   - Times Played: 0 (never played this hand)\n\n2. **Uranus** - Level up Two Pair: +1 Mult and +20 chips\n   - Current: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2\n   - After: Level 2, Base Chips 40, Base Mult 3\n   - Times Played: 1 (scored 600 chips in Ante 1 Boss)\n\n3. **Venus** - Level up Three of a Kind: +2 Mult and +20 chips\n   - Current: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3\n   - After: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5\n   - Times Played: 2 (scored 189 and 180 chips)\n\n## Analysis\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- **Two Pair**: Played 1 time, scored 600 chips (very high score)\n- **Three of a Kind**: Played 2 times, scored 189 and 180 chips\n- **Straight Flush**: Never played\n\nThe key question is: which hand will I most likely be playing going forward?\n\n**Neptune (Straight Flush)**: This is a high-value hand, but it's very difficult to make. \n\nStraight Flush requires five consecutive cards of the same suit, making it unreliable despite the strong stat boost. **Uranus (Two Pair)** proved effective with that 600-chip boss round score, and it's much easier to assemble consistently, though the upgrade is modest. **Venus (Three of a Kind)** sits in the middle—more achievable than Straight Flush but less proven than Two Pair, with a moderate stat increase. I should prioritize hands I can actually execute reliably over theoretical power. d Three of a Kind twice versus Two Pair once, and the upgrade is notably better with +2 Mult compared to +1 Mult. Three of a Kind remains fairly accessible to construct, while that 600-chip Two Pair score was likely inflated by joker synergies rather than representing typical performance.\n\nVenus for Three of a Kind seems like the stronger play—it's a hand I can reliably assemble, the stat boost is more substantial, and it'll push Constellation to X1.1 Mult as a bonus. I'll go with select 3.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
