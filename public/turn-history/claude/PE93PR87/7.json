{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- In SHOP phase (after selecting the Full House planet card)\n- Current Money: $1\n- I have 1 joker: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per played face card)\n- Full House is now Level 2: 65 chips, 6 mult\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Mystic Summit (Joker) - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining - $5 (can't afford)\n2. Uranus (Planet) - Level up Two Pair - $3 (can't afford)\n3. Magic Trick (Voucher) - Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10 (can't afford)\n4. Reroll cost: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**What's Next:**\n- Need to face Big Blind (450 chips required)\n- Then Boss Blind (600 chips, discards 2 random cards per hand)\n\n**My Resources:**\n- I only have $1\n- I cannot afford anything in the shop\n- I've been playing Three of a Kind successfully\n- I now have Full House at Level 2 as a stronger option\n\n**Analysis:**\nWith only $1, I cannot:\n- Buy Mystic Summit ($5)\n- Buy Uranus ($3)\n- Buy Magic Trick voucher ($10)\n- Reroll the shop ($5)\n\nSince I cannot afford any purchases, my only viable action is to proceed to the round select phase. I need to save my $1 and move forward to tackle the Big Blind, where I'll need to score 450 chips.\n\nWith:\n- Smiley Face joker (+5 Mult per face card played)\n- Full House now at Level 2 (65 base chips, 6 base mult)\n- Three of a Kind at Level 1 (30 base chips, 3 base mult)\n\n\nThe Big Blind should be manageable if I can construct a Full House with face cards. Playing three Jacks and two other cards would give me 95 chips (65 base plus 30 from the face cards) multiplied by 9 (6 base mult plus 15 from Smiley Face's bonus), which should comfortably exceed the 450 chip requirement.","action":"\"round_select\""}
