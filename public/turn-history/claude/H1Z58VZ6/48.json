{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in the SHOP phase with:\n- $0 remaining (spent everything on the Scholar joker)\n- 5/5 jokers (at max capacity):\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card\n  2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n  3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (+2 per remaining deck card)\n  4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n  5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\nAvailable shop options:\n- The Magician (Tarot): $3 - Can't afford\n- Standard Pack: $4 - Can't afford\n- Telescope (Voucher): $10 - Can't afford\n- Reroll: $5 - Can't afford\n\nSince I have $0 and can't afford anything in the shop, the only logical action is to proceed to the next phase by using the `round_select` command.\n\nMy joker setup is complete with 5 jokers that synergize well with pairs (my most-played hand):\n- Pair at Level 3 (40 chips, 4 mult base)\n- Blue Joker adds consistent +104 chips\n- Jolly Joker adds +8 mult for pairs\n- Scholar adds significant bonuses when aces are scored (+20 chips, +4 mult per ace)\n- Smiley Face adds +5 mult per face card\n\nThis setup should give me solid scoring potential for Ante 3, Round 5. Time to move forward.","action":"\"round_select\""}
