{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $8\n- Jokers: 5/5 (full)\n  1. Smiley Face (+5 Mult per face card) - $2\n  2. Square Joker (+8 Chips for 4-card hands) - $2\n  3. Red Card (+0 Mult, only useful if skipping boosters) - $2\n  4. Blue Joker (+104 Chips, +2 per remaining deck card) - $2\n  5. Jolly Joker (+8 Mult if hand contains pair) - $1\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- The Magician (Tarot): $3 - Enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards\n- Scholar (Joker): $4 - Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n- Jumbo Celestial Pack: $6 - Choose 1 of 5 Planet cards\n- Standard Pack: $4 - Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards\n- Telescope (Voucher): $10 - Celestial Packs always contain most played hand's planet\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Hand Level Analysis:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - most played (3 times)\n- Pair: Level 2 (25 chips, 3 mult) - second most played (4 times)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - played 2 times\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Last hands scored around 1,400-1,480 chips\n- Currently in Ante 3, which will have higher chip requirements\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n\n1. **Red Card** is currently useless (+0 Mult) - should consider selling it\n\n\n2. Most of my jokers are situational - Smiley Face needs face cards, Square Joker only triggers on 4-card hands, while Blue Joker and Jolly Joker provide consistent value. Scholar Joker could be strong since I still have 2 aces in deck and would pair well with my frequent pair plays, giving +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored.\n\nThe Magician offers RNG-dependent bonuses through lucky cards, potentially converting aces into lucky aces for extra multiplier chances. Jumbo Celestial Pack at $6 is appealing since Three of a Kind is my most-played hand at Level 3, and leveling up either that or Pair (my second most-played at Level 2) would significantly boost scoring. Telescope Voucher is out of reach at $10 when I only have $8 available, though it would guarantee planet upgrades for my most-played hands.\n\nI'm weighing whether to sell the Red Card for an extra $2 to reach $10, which would unlock either Telescope for future guaranteed planets or a combination like Scholar plus Jumbo Celestial Pack. The immediate value seems stronger with the pack since it directly upgrades my most-played hands right now, rather than investing in future shop benefits.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
