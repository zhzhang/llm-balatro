{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state and decide on the best action.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Blind: Big Blind, need 1200 chips\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips, face card)\n3. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n6. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips, face card)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently 0)\n3. Red Card - +3 Mult when booster pack skipped (currently +0 Mult)\n4. Blue Joker - +2 Chips for each remaining card in deck (currently +80 Chips)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of 10s (positions 1 and 3): 10 of Spades and 10 of Hearts\n- Three hearts (positions 2, 3, 4): Queen♥, 10♥, 9♥ - not enough for a flush\n- Two clubs (positions 5, 6): Ace♣, Jack♣ - not enough for a flush\n- Two diamonds (positions 7, 8): 8♦, 7♦ - not enough for a flush\n\nLet me calculate the scoring potential of the pair of 10s:\n\n**Playing Pair of 10s with face cards (4 cards total to trigger Square Joker):**\n\n\nPlaying 10♠, 10♥, Queen♥, Jack♣ gives me a pair with two face cards. The base pair scores 25 chips plus 20 from the 10s, and the Blue Joker adds 80 chips. The Square Joker triggers with exactly 4 cards for an additional 4 chips, totaling 129 chips. For multiplier, the pair gives 3x base, and the two face cards activate Smiley Face for +10 Mult, bringing the total to 13x.\n\nThat yields 129 × 13 = 1,677 chips—well above the 1,200 threshold. Playing just the pair without the face cards would only score 375 chips, which falls short. I should examine what other hands might work, but this four-card combination appears to be my strongest option. ♥), 5 (Ace♣), 7 (8♦), 8 (7♦). This opens up the possibility of drawing another Queen or Jack to pair with what I already have, getting a third 10, or just hitting more face cards overall. Let me commit to this discard.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,5,7,8]"}
