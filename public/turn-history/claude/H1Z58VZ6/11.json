{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Blind: Big Blind, need 450 chips\n- Current Money: $4\n- Joker: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n2: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n3: 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4: 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n5: Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n6: 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n7: Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n8: King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Three Aces: Ace of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds (positions 2, 5, 7)\n- One King: King of Diamonds (position 8)\n- Hearts: Ace, 10, 2 (positions 2, 3, 4)\n- Clubs: Ace, 9 (positions 5, 6)\n- Diamonds: Ace, King (positions 7, 8)\n- Spades: 5 (position 1)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n1. **Three of a Kind (Aces)** - positions 2, 5, 7\n   - Base: 30 chips, 3 mult\n   - Cards: 11 + 11 + 11 = 33 chips from the aces\n   - Total chips: 30 + 33 = 63 chips\n   - Aces are not face cards, so no Smiley Face bonus\n   - Final score: 63 × 3 = 189 chips\n\n2. **Pair of Aces + King for Two Pair** - I only have one King, so this won't work\n\n3. **Flush (Hearts)** - Only have 3 hearts, need 5 for a flush\n\n**Important Note about Smiley Face:**\n- Smiley Face gives +5 Mult for each played FACE card that scores\n- Face cards are Jack, Queen, King only\n- Aces don't count as face cards, so my three Aces won't trigger the bonus\n\nThe Three of a Kind with Aces scores 189 chips total, which falls well short of the 450 target. I should discard most cards and draw fresh ones, keeping only the King of Diamonds since it's a face card that works with Smiley Face. Let me reconsider what to hold and what to replace. istically make? I need face cards to trigger Smiley Face, and a pair of Kings with that modifier could score around 360 chips. If I can secure even one pair of face cards, that's a substantial boost toward my 450-chip goal.\n\nI'll discard the low cards—5 of Spades, 10 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs—and hold onto my three Aces plus the King of Diamonds. This setup gives me flexibility to draw into additional face cards or another King for a strong hand.\n\nLet me verify my Three of a Kind calculation: playing the three Aces gives me 30 base chips plus 33 from the Aces themselves (11 each), totaling 63 chips. With the 3× multiplier from Three of a Kind, that's 189 chips—still well short of my 450 target. Aces don't count as face cards, so Smiley Face won't activate here. I need to find better cards through the discard.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,6]"}
