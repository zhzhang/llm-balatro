{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in a Planet Pack selection phase. I have 5 planet cards to choose from:\n\n1. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips\n2. Earth - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips\n3. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips\n4. Mercury - Level up Pair +1 Mult and +15 chips (lvl.5)\n5. Jupiter - Level up Flush +2 Mult and +15 chips\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Pair: Level 5, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 6, Times Played 7\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7, Times Played 3\n- Two Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2, Times Played 2\n- All others are Level 1\n\nMy strategy has been heavily focused on playing Pairs (played 7 times), which is already at Level 5. My jokers are also optimized for this:\n- Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n- Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n- Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored (pairs of aces)\n- Blue Joker - +104 Chips (general)\n- Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands (not super relevant for pairs)\n\nThe clear choice here is Mercury (option 4) which levels up Pair. Even though it says \"(lvl.5)\", that just means it's leveling up Pair from level 5 to level 6. This will give me +1 Mult and +15 chips for my primary hand type.\n\nAfter selecting Mercury, my Pair will become:\n- Level 6, Base Chips 85, Base Mult 7\n\n\nThe other options don't align with my current approach—Four of a Kind, Full House, and Straight Flush haven't been played at all, while Flush has only been used once. Mercury is the only choice that reinforces my established Pair-focused strategy.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
