{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- I just completed the Big Blind and am now in the Shop phase\n- Current Money: $5\n- I have 4 jokers (max 5)\n- No consumables (max 2)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card (Common, sells for $2)\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently +4 Chips, Common, sells for $2)\n3. Red Card - +3 Mult when booster pack skipped (currently +0 Mult, Common, sells for $2)\n4. Blue Joker - +2 Chips per remaining card in deck (currently +104 Chips, Common, sells for $2)\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Gift Card (Uncommon) - Add $1 of sell value to every Joker and Consumable at end of round - Cost: $6\n2. Faceless Joker (Common) - Earn $5 if 3+ face cards discarded at the same time - Cost: $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards - Cost: $4\n2. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - Cost: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for your most played poker hand - Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my hand levels, Three of a Kind is my most played hand at level 3 and has been performing well. I've played it 3 times. Pair is also at level 2 with 3 plays.\n\nMy current jokers are mostly weak commons:\n\n\nMost of my jokers have limited utility—Smiley Face requires face cards I don't always play, Square Joker only triggers with exactly 4 cards, and Red Card hasn't activated yet. Blue Joker is carrying the weight with +104 chips from the remaining deck. With $5 available, I could grab Faceless Joker for $4 if I can reliably discard multiple face cards, or use a Buffoon Pack to potentially upgrade my joker lineup.\n\nThe Arcana Pack is tempting since Tarot cards can fundamentally enhance my deck by creating bonus multiplier cards or converting existing cards into more powerful versions. Given that I'm on Ante 2/8 and blinds are scaling up, investing in deck enhancement might be smarter than hoping for a better joker from a pack.\n\nBut my current joker setup is genuinely weak—all commons with no synergy. The Buffoon Pack gives me a direct shot at upgrading that, and with only $5 total, I need to be strategic. I think buying the Buffoon Pack for $4 is the right call since weak jokers will hold me back more than missing out on a single Tarot card right now.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
