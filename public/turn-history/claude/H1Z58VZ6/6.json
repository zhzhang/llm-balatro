Could I make a straight?\\n   - For a straight, I need 5 consecutive ranks\\n   - I have: 7, 6, 5, 4, 2\\n   - 7-6-5-4 is only 4 cards, need one more consecutive\\n   - Can't make a straight\\n\\nThe pair of 4s is my only viable hand, scoring just 36 chips. I need 192 more chips across 3 remaining hands\\u2014averaging 78 per hand. Since this pair is weak, I should use a discard to hunt for better cards rather than play it now.\\n\\nWith 37 cards left in the deck, stronger options like Queens, Jacks, Aces, and Kings are still available. I'll discard my isolated low cards\\u2014the 2 of Spades, 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 6 of Diamonds\\u2014while keeping the pair of 4s and high cards like the Jack and King. Drawing 5 new cards could significantly improve my position. I need to prioritize fishing for stronger combinations rather than settling for a weak pair. The 2 of Spades, 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 6 of Diamonds are my weakest holdings, so I'll discard those along with one of the 4s since a pair at that rank only yields 36 chips anyway. That means letting go of positions 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\\nCommand: discard 2 5 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 5]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Jack of Spades.

For high card, the base chips are 5 with a 1x multiplier, and only the highest card contributes its chip value. Playing the King of Hearts as high card would give me 5 + 10 chips total.\\n\\nThat's only 15 points, which is far short of the 192 chips I need across my remaining 3 hands. I should use one of my 2 remaining discards to swap out the low cards\\u2014the 5 of Spades, 4 of Hearts, 3 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds\\u2014while keeping the Jack, King, 10, and 9. I'm thinking about discarding positions 3, 6, 7, and 8 to replace those weak cards. Actually, let me reconsider since I have 3 Spades and 3 Hearts\\u2014if I draw 2 more cards of either suit, I could complete a flush. There are 9 Spades and 8 Hearts left in the deck out of 32 remaining cards. The odds of hitting both cards for a flush are slim though\\u2014roughly 7% for Spades and similar for Hearts\\u2014so it's a risky strategy.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could discard the low cards and aim for pairs or stronger combinations. With Queens, Jacks, Kings, and other face cards still available in the deck, there might be better value in drawing toward a pair or higher-ranking hand rather than chasing the flush draw.\\nCommand: discard 3 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 6]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Jack of Spades.

Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\\n3. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\\n4. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\\n5. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\\n6. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\\n7. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\\n8. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\\n\\n**Possible Hands:**\\n\\nLet me check for pairs:\\n- 10s: positions 2 and 5 (10 of Spades, 10 of Hearts)\\n- 9s: positions 3, 6, and 8 (9 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds) - This is THREE OF A KIND!\\n\\n**Three of a Kind (9s):**\\n- Base chips: 30\\n- 9 of Spades: +9 chips\\n- 9 of Clubs: +9 chips\\n- 9 of Diamonds: +9 chips\\n- Total chips: 30 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 57 chips\\n- Base mult: 3\\n- Total score: 57 \\u00d7 3 = 171 chips\\n\\nWait, let me also check for two pair:\\n- 10s: positions 2 and 5\\n- 9s: any two of positions 3, 6, and 8\\n\\n**Two Pair (10s and 9s):**\\n\\n\\n- Base chips: 20\\n- 10 of Spades: +10 chips\\n- 10 of Hearts: +10 chips\\n- 9 of Spades: +9 chips\\n- 9 of Clubs: +9 chips (or 9 of Diamonds)\\n- Total chips: 20 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 = 58 chips\\n- Base mult: 2\\n- Total score: 58 \\u00d7 2 = 116 chips\\n\\nTwo pair scores 116 chips, which is significantly less than the three of a kind's 171. Now checking for flush possibilities with the spades suit (Jack, 10, 9) and hearts suit.\\n\\nNo flush is possible since I can't gather five cards of the same suit. For straights, I'd need consecutive ranks like Jack-10-9-8-7 or 10-9-8-7-6, but I'm missing the required middle cards. Three of a kind with the three 9s clearly dominates at 171 chips.\\n\\nPlaying those three 9s gives me 30 base chips plus 27 from the three 9s, multiplied by 3 for a total of 171. That brings me to 279 chips overall, leaving just 21 more needed to hit 300. With two hands left, that's easily within reach.\\nCommand: play 3 6 8 three of a kind 171\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Jack of Spades.

The first position argument is the position within your consumables inventory of the consumable you'd like to use. Subsequent position arguments specify the cards in hand that the consumeable will be used on, if that consumeable requires targets.\\nsell_consumable <consumeable_position> - Sell a consumeable from the consumeables section.\\nrearrange_jokers <joker1> <joker2> ... <jokerN> - Rearrange the list of currently owned jokers. Every index in the list of current jokers must be present, i.e. if there are 5 jokers, the indices 1-5 must be present.\\nsell_joker <joker_position> - Sell a joker from the jokers section.\\nplay <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Play the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck. You may play up to 5 cards at a time. If you play a hand, you must also respond with the intended hand type you think you are playing, and an estimate of the number of chips you think you will earn from the hand. Use the results of previous hands played to inform your estimate.\\ndiscard <card1> <card2> ... <card5> - Discard the selected cards and draw new ones from the deck.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (Small Blind)\n- Chips needed: 300\n- Current chips: 279\n- Remaining chips needed: 21 (300 - 279)\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 1\n- Money: $4\n- No jokers, no consumables\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n4. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n8. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI only need 21 more chips to win this round. Let me check what hands I can make:\n\n**Pairs:**\n- 10s: positions 2 and 5 (10 of Spades, 10 of Hearts)\n- Kings: positions 4 and 6 (King of Hearts, King of Clubs)\n\n**Pair of 10s:**\n- Base chips: 10\n- 10 of Spades: +10 chips\n- 10 of Hearts: +10 chips\n- Total chips: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 chips\n- Base mult: 2\n- Total score: 30 × 2 = 60 chips\n\n**Pair of Kings:**\n- Base chips: 10\n- King of Hearts: +10 chips\n- King of Clubs: +10 chips\n- Total chips: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 chips\n- Base mult: 2\n- Total score: 30 × 2 = 60 chips\n\n\n- Two pair with both the 10s and Kings would give me 60 chips total with a 2x multiplier for 120 chips, which easily exceeds my 21-chip requirement. A high card hand would only provide 5 base chips, so I should focus on the stronger pair combinations available."
