{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $9\n- Next Blind: Boss (4000 chips needed) - All Diamond cards are debuffed\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (2 chips per card in deck, currently 52 cards)\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Egg (Common Joker) - Gains $3 sell value at end of round - Cost: $4\n- Brainstorm (Rare Joker) - Copies ability of leftmost joker - Cost: $10\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack - 5 Tarot cards, choose 1 - Cost: $6\n- Jumbo Celestial Pack - 5 Planet cards, choose 1 - Cost: $6\n- Telescope Voucher - Celestial Packs always contain Planet for most played hand - Cost: $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Last pair hand scored 3,703 chips\n- Pair is at Level 4 (55 chips, 5 mult) and is my most played hand (6 times)\n- Need to beat Boss Blind with 4000 chips, but all Diamonds are debuffed\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Boss Blind debuffs all Diamond cards, which means any diamonds in my hand won't score their chips or trigger abilities. This could significantly weaken my scoring potential.\n\nLet me calculate what I can score with the Boss debuff:\n\nFor a pair of face cards (non-diamonds):\n\n\n- Base chips: 55\n- Card chips: 10 + 10 = 20\n- Blue Joker: +104\n- Total chips: 179\n\n- Base mult: 5\n- Jolly Joker: +8\n- Smiley Face: +10 (2 face cards)\n- Total mult: 23\n\nScore: 179 × 23 = 4,117 chips\n\nThis beats the Boss Blind threshold, but I need to ensure I draw non-diamond face cards or aces. The Jumbo Celestial Pack could help me optimize my hand composition for the upcoming blind.\n\nWith $9 available, I'm looking at affordable upgrades. The Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6) would strengthen my Pair hand significantly by leveling it up, while the Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6) could provide useful Tarot enhancements. Other options like Telescope Voucher ($10), Brainstorm ($10), and Reroll Shop ($5) are either too expensive or less immediately valuable. The Egg ($4) would generate passive income but requires selling a joker first since I'm at capacity.\n\nLeveling Pair to 5 would boost my base chips to around 60-65 with 5-6 mult, pushing my score from 4,117 to potentially 4,500+—a solid cushion for the Boss Blind. The Celestial Pack is the most direct way to increase my scoring power before the final challenge.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
