{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8 (halfway through the game)\n- Money: $4\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2 (empty)\n- Owned Vouchers: Grabber (+1 hand per round permanently)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. To Do List - $4 - Earn $4 if poker hand is Full House\n2. Spectral Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Spectral cards\n3. Arcana Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards\n\n**My hand patterns:**\n- Mostly playing Pairs (Level 6, 8 times played)\n- Occasionally Three of a Kind (Level 3, 4 times played)\n- Rarely Full House (Level 1, 0 times played)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $4 left and three options that all cost $4:\n\n1. **To Do List** - This would earn me $4 if I play a Full House. However:\n   - I've never played a Full House in this run (0 times)\n   - My joker setup is optimized for pairs, not Full House\n   - This would basically break even and doesn't help my strategy\n\n2. **Spectral Pack** - Spectral cards can be powerful but risky. They often:\n   - Modify/enhance cards permanently\n   - Can add editions to jokers\n   - Sometimes have negative effects\n   - Might give me something useful for deck manipulation\n\n3. **Arcana Pack** - Tarot cards can:\n   - Enhance cards (turn them into bonus, mult, wild, glass, steel, etc.)\n   - Modify suits or ranks\n   - Generally safer than Spectral cards\n\nGiven my current setup with a strong pair-focused joker lineup and specific synergies around aces and face cards, I have room for utility in my consumable slots. The Arcana Pack seems like the safer choice since my deck is already well-tuned and I don't want to risk disrupting it with unpredictable Spectral effects.\n\nI'm also mindful that I just spent $10 on the Grabber voucher and need to preserve some cash for the next shop after facing the Boss Blind. The $5 reroll cost is out of reach anyway, so I should focus on what I can actually use right now.\n\nSpectral cards feel too unpredictable for my current setup, and To Do List doesn't match how I'm playing. The Arcana Pack stands out because Tarot enhancements would directly strengthen my existing cards—boosting aces to bonus cards synergizes with Scholar and Fibonacci, or making face cards into mult cards works with Smiley Face.\n\nEven though I'd be left with minimal cash, the deck improvements from the Arcana Pack seem more valuable than sitting on $4 going into the Boss Blind. I'll get interest and hand money after winning anyway, so the consumable boost is worth it.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
