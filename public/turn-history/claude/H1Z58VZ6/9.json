{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (just finished Small Blind)\n- Currently in SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $4\n- Jokers: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n- No consumables\n- Max Jokers: 5, Max Consumables: 2\n\n**Shop Available:**\n1. Mars (Planet card) - Levels up Four of a Kind, +3 Mult and +30 chips, Cost: $3\n2. The Chariot (Tarot card) - Enhances 1 card into Steel Card (X1.5 Mult while in hand), Cost: $3\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to use immediately, Cost: $4\n\n**Voucher:**\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently, Cost: $10\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $4 and need to decide what to do. Let me think about my options:\n\n1. **Buy Mars ($3)** - This would level up Four of a Kind, but I haven't played any four of a kinds yet. This doesn't seem valuable right now.\n\n2. **Buy The Chariot ($3)** - This would enhance 1 card into a Steel Card, which gives X1.5 Mult while the card stays in hand. This could be useful with Smiley Face - if I have a face card with Steel enhancement in hand while playing other face cards, I'd get the X1.5 Mult from the Steel card plus the +5 Mult from Smiley Face for each played face card.\n\n3. **Buy Celestial Pack ($4)** - This would use all my money and give me a choice of 3 planet cards to use immediately. Planet cards level up hand types, which could be useful for the hands I'm playing (Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind).\n   \nI can't afford a reroll at $5, so my real choice is between spending $3 on a card or $4 on the Celestial Pack. Since I've only played Pair, Two Pair, and Three of a Kind once each, leveling up any of these hands would provide immediate scaling. The Celestial Pack gives me flexibility to pick whichever hand type benefits most, making it the stronger play despite using all my remaining funds. next round. I'm still early enough that preserving capital matters more than making a marginal upgrade now. I'll have another shop phase soon where I can make a more informed decision based on what hands I'm actually using most frequently. sure what the Celestial Pack would actually contain. It's too much of a gamble to spend all my money on an unknown upgrade when I already have Smiley Face generating value. I'll move forward to the next round and build up my bankroll instead, giving me more flexibility for future purchases.","action":"\"round_select\""}
