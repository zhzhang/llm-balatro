{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state and make a decision.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Ante 5/8, Round 12\n- Just beat the Big Blind (needed 16,500 chips)\n- Currently in the SHOP phase\n- Money: $13\n\nCurrent Jokers:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (increases as deck gets depleted)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n\nShop offerings:\nCards:\n1. Showman - Joker, Tarot, Planet, and Spectral cards may appear multiple times (Uncommon, $5)\n2. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if played hand contains a Three of a Kind (Common, $4)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards ($4)\n2. Jumbo Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Director's Cut - Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante, $10 per roll ($10)\n\nConsumables:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Pair: Level 6 (most played - 16 times)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (played 5 times)\n- All other hands are Level 1\n\nMy strategy has been heavily reliant on pairs, which are at Level 6. I'm approaching the Boss Blind of Ante 5, which will likely require much higher chip totals.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n\nMy current joker synergies are optimized around pairs and Aces—Fibonacci triggers on low cards I frequently score, Scholar amplifies Aces, and Jolly Joker rewards pairs. Blue Joker's chip scaling is substantial at +104. The Wily Joker could add value for Three of a Kind hands, but I'd need to sacrifice an existing joker since I'm at capacity. Showman would enable duplicate card effects, which could multiply my existing synergies. Given the Boss Blind approaching, I should focus on maximizing my current strengths rather than pivoting to new mechanics. chips and 8 mult. My recent scores with pairs—4,619 with eights and 7,761 with Aces—cleared the 16,500 requirement, but the Boss Blind will demand much more. Investing in Pair seems like the strongest path forward since it's my most reliable hand. The Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6 lets me pick a planet card to push Pair even higher, which should give me the edge I need for the final round. That leaves $7 to either reroll the shop or hold in reserve.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
