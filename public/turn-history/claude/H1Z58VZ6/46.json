{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in a PLANET_PACK phase where I need to choose one of 5 planet cards:\n\n1. Earth - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips (Currently Level 1: 40 chips, 4 mult)\n2. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips (Currently Level 1: 100 chips, 8 mult)\n3. Saturn - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips (Currently Level 1: 30 chips, 4 mult)\n4. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips (Currently Level 3: 70 chips, 7 mult)\n5. Mercury - Level up Pair +1 Mult and +15 chips (Currently Level 2: 25 chips, 3 mult)\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- Pair: Level 2 (25 chips, 3 mult) - played 4 times (MOST PLAYED)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - played 3 times\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - played 2 times\n- Straight: Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult) - played 1 time\n- Flush: Level 1 (35 chips, 4 mult) - played 1 time\n- High Card: Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult) - played 2 times\n\nI've been playing Pair most often (4 times), followed by Three of a Kind (3 times).\n\nMy jokers currently:\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (+2 per remaining deck card)\n\n\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains a Pair\n\nMercury stands out since Pair is my most-played hand and the Jolly Joker synergizes perfectly with it, providing an extra +8 Mult whenever I score a Pair. Upgrading to Level 3 would give me 40 chips and 4 mult, making Pair significantly stronger. Venus is already at Level 3, so the marginal gain is smaller compared to pushing Pair higher. chips, 8 mult) to Level 2 (140 chips, 12 mult) — haven't played this yet and it's extremely difficult to construct.\n\nGiven my play patterns, Mercury stands out as the clear choice. Pair is my most-played hand by far at 4 times, and I have Jolly Joker providing +8 Mult specifically for pairs. Upgrading it to Level 3 will give me +15 chips and +1 mult on my most reliable hand type, which matters as chip requirements scale up in Ante 3.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
