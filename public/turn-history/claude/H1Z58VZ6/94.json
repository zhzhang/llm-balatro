{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 11\n- Game Step: SHOP (after winning Small Blind, next is Big Blind)\n- Money: $7\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Inventory:**\n- 5 Jokers (at max capacity):\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n  3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n  4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace scored\n  5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n- 1 Consumable: Pluto (level up High Card)\n- 1 Voucher: Grabber\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Runner - Gains +15 Chips if played hand contains a Straight ($5)\n  2. Credit Card - Go up to -$20 in debt ($1)\n- Boosters:\n  1. Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)\n- Voucher:\n  1. Director's Cut - Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante ($10)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just used Strength to convert Kings to Aces, so now I have more Aces in my deck which synergizes with Scholar (+20 chips, +4 mult per Ace) and Fibonacci (+8 mult for Aces).\n\nMy strategy is heavily pair-focused (13 pairs played at Level 6: 85 chips, 7 mult). Recent scores have been good: 4,225, 2,505, 7,602 chips.\n\nLooking at the shop:\n- Runner ($5) - doesn't fit my pair strategy\n- Credit Card ($1) - not needed, I have positive money\n\n\n- Jumbo Standard Pack ($6) - could add better cards to my deck\n- Director's Cut ($10) - too expensive, I only have $7\n\nWith $7 available, I'm weighing whether to reroll for $5 and hope for better jokers, buy the pack to strengthen my deck, or just push forward. Since Big Blind is coming up and my pair-based setup is performing well, I should consider if spending now helps me survive the harder rounds ahead. I'm torn between rerolling now versus pushing forward. Rerolling costs $5, leaving me with only $2 for the next shop—not enough flexibility if something good appears. Since I'm about to face the Big Blind anyway, I'd earn money from remaining hands and interest, giving me a better budget afterward. My current setup is functional enough to handle this round, and my recent King-to-Ace conversion strengthened my deck. I should just proceed and build my resources for a stronger shop phase next.","action":"\"round_select\""}
