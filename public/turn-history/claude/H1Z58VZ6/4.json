Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\\n6. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\\n7. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\\n8. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\\n\\n**Possible Hands I Can Make:**\\n1. **Pair of Aces** (positions 1 and 5): \\n   - Base chips: 10\\n   - Ace of Hearts: +11 chips\\n   - Ace of Clubs: +11 chips\\n   - Total chips: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32 chips\\n   - Base mult: 2\\n   - Total score: 32 \\u00d7 2 = 64 chips\\n\\n2. **Flush (5 Hearts)** - I have 4 hearts (Ace, King, 6, 4), so I can't make a flush yet\\n\\n3. **High Card** - Various options but not efficient\\n\\nI need 300 chips total. With 4 hands remaining, I should aim to score around 75 chips per hand on average, though that's conservative.\\n\\n**Strategy:**\\nThe pair of Aces would only give me 64 chips, which is quite low. I should discard cards to try to get better hands. Let me think about what to discard:\\n\\nLooking at my hand:\\n- I have a pair of Aces (good)\\n\\n\\n- I have 4 Hearts (1 away from a flush)\\n- The rest are scattered\\n\\nI should focus on either completing the flush or improving the Aces. Discarding the non-heart cards that aren't Aces makes sense: the 8 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds, and 5 of Diamonds. If I draw 3 new cards, I might hit another heart to complete the flush or find additional value.\\n\\nLooking at the odds with 44 cards remaining, there are 9 hearts left (roughly 20% per draw) versus only 2 remaining Aces (under 5% per draw). A flush would give me a solid hand with a 4x multiplier, so pursuing that seems more promising than chasing a third Ace.\\n\\nIf I discard the non-heart cards and draw 4 new ones, my chances of hitting at least one heart are decent given how many are still in the deck. I have enough hands and discards remaining to take this risk. The key is identifying which cards to let go\\u2014the ones that don't contribute to any strong hand, like the low clubs and diamonds that won't help me build toward a flush or pair.\\nCommand: discard 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 3]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Jack of Spades.

Can't play this yet.\\n\\n**Best Play Options:**\\n\\nTwo Pair gives me 108 chips, which is the strongest option available. The Pair of Aces yields 64 chips, while the Pair of 6s only produces 44 chips. Since I need 300 chips total and currently have none, maximizing early rounds is crucial for building momentum.\\n\\nI'm weighing whether to play this hand now or discard again. Playing Two Pair guarantees 108 chips and leaves me needing 192 from my remaining 3 hands\\u2014roughly 64 per hand, which feels manageable. Discarding risks not improving my hand, though I still have 3 discards available. With 4 hands left to work with, playing the Two Pair seems like the safer path forward.\\n\\nI'll go ahead and play it: Ace of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, 6 of Clubs. Let me verify the scoring\\u2014base of 20 with 2x multiplier, plus the card values adding up to 54 total, giving me 108 chips when multiplied.\\nCommand: play 3 5 7 8 two pair 108\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Jack of Spades.

Could I make a straight?\\n   - For a straight, I need 5 consecutive ranks\\n   - I have: 7, 6, 5, 4, 2\\n   - 7-6-5-4 is only 4 cards, need one more consecutive\\n   - Can't make a straight\\n\\nThe pair of 4s is my only viable hand, scoring just 36 chips. I need 192 more chips across 3 remaining hands\\u2014averaging 78 per hand. Since this pair is weak, I should use a discard to hunt for better cards rather than play it now.\\n\\nWith 37 cards left in the deck, stronger options like Queens, Jacks, Aces, and Kings are still available. I'll discard my isolated low cards\\u2014the 2 of Spades, 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 6 of Diamonds\\u2014while keeping the pair of 4s and high cards like the Jack and King. Drawing 5 new cards could significantly improve my position. I need to prioritize fishing for stronger combinations rather than settling for a weak pair. The 2 of Spades, 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 6 of Diamonds are my weakest holdings, so I'll discard those along with one of the 4s since a pair at that rank only yields 36 chips anyway. That means letting go of positions 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\\nCommand: discard 2 5 6 7 8\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Jack of Spades.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (Small Blind)\n- Chips needed: 300\n- Current chips: 108\n- Remaining chips needed: 192\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Money: $4\n- No jokers, no consumables\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n3. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n4. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n7. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n\nLet me check for straights:\n- Jack (11), 10, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2\n- Can I make a straight? I need 5 consecutive ranks.\n- Jack-10-9-8-7? No, I don't have 8 or 7\n- 10-9-8-7-6? No, I don't have 8, 7, or 6\n- 9-8-7-6-5? No, I don't have 8, 7, or 6\n- 5-4-3-2-A? No, I don't have an Ace\n- Can't make a straight\n\nLet me check for flushes:\n- Spades: Jack, 9, 5 (3 cards)\n- Hearts: King, 10, 4 (3 cards)\n- Diamonds: 3, 2 (2 cards)\n- Can't make a flush\n\nLet me check for pairs:\n- No pairs visible\n\nLet me check for high card:\n\n\n- Best high card would be the King of Hearts\n\nSince I don't have any pairs, flushes, or straights, my best option is to play a high card with the highest cards. For high card, the base chips are 5 with a 1x multiplier, and only the highest card contributes its chip value. Playing the King of Hearts as high card would give me 5 + 10 chips total.\n\nThat's only 15 points, which is far short of the 192 chips I need across my remaining 3 hands. I should use one of my 2 remaining discards to swap out the low cards—the 5 of Spades, 4 of Hearts, 3 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds—while keeping the Jack, King, 10, and 9. I'm thinking about discarding positions 3, 6, 7, and 8 to replace those weak cards. Actually, let me reconsider since I have 3 Spades and 3 Hearts—if I draw 2 more cards of either suit, I could complete a flush. There are 9 Spades and 8 Hearts left in the deck out of 32 remaining cards. The odds of hitting both cards for a flush are slim though—roughly 7% for Spades and similar for Hearts—so it's a risky strategy.\n\nAlternatively, I could discard the low cards and aim for pairs or stronger combinations. With Queens, Jacks, Kings, and other face cards still available in the deck, there might be better value in drawing toward a pair or higher-ranking hand rather than chasing the flush draw."
