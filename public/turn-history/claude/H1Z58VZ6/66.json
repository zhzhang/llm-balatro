{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $5\n- Just leveled up Pair from Level 5 to Level 6 (now 85 chips, 7 mult)\n\n**My Jokers (all 5 slots filled):**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. To Do List (Foil) - Earn $4 if poker hand is a Four of a Kind, +50 chips - $6\n2. Saturn - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Grabber - Permanently gain +1 hand per round - $10\n\n**Current Money: $5**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $5 left. Let me evaluate my options:\n\n1. **Saturn ($3)** - Levels up Straight, but I've only played it once. Not aligned with my pair strategy. Would leave me with $2.\n\n2. **Standard Pack ($4)** - Could add useful playing cards. Would leave me with $1.\n\n3. **Reroll ($5)** - Uses all my money to see new options.\n\n4. **Round Select** - Save the $5 and proceed to the next round.\n\nLooking at Ante 4, the chip requirements will be significantly higher. A typical small blind at Ante 4 might be around 2000-2500 chips, big blind 3500-4500, and boss blind 6000+.\n\n\nMy pair strategy with the Level 6 Pair and current joker setup should generate solid scoring. A pair of face cards would give me around 209 chips with the Blue Joker and base pair value, then multiply that by roughly 25 mult when combining Jolly Joker's bonus, Smiley Face's face card multipliers, and Scholar's ace bonuses if applicable.\n\nThis scoring handles regular blinds comfortably but might fall short against boss blinds in later antes. Looking at my shop options, I'm weighing whether to spend $5 on a Standard Pack to improve my card composition, use a Reroll to hunt for better jokers or planets, or save the money for the next shop phase. Since I'll earn additional funds from remaining hands and interest by the end of Ante 4, holding onto my $5 seems like the stronger play—none of the current options feel essential enough to justify spending now.","action":"\"round_select\""}
