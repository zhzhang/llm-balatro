{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 10\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $7\n- Jokers: 5/5 (maxed out)\n- Consumables: 1/2\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (2 chips per card in deck)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\n- Crazy Joker: +12 Mult if Straight ($4)\n- Clever Joker: +80 Chips if Two Pair ($4)\n- Jumbo Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 5 cards ($6)\n- Mega Standard Pack: Choose 2 of 5 cards ($8)\n- Director's Cut voucher: Reroll Boss 1 time per Ante ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair is my most leveled at Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - played 11 times\n- Three of a Kind at Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult) - played 4 times\n- All other hands at Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm entering Ante 5, which means the chip requirements will increase significantly. Looking at my strategy so far:\n- I've been heavily relying on pairs (11 times played)\n- My joker synergy focuses on: pairs (Jolly Joker), face cards (Smiley Face), aces (Scholar), Fibonacci numbers (Fibonacci), and general chip boost (Blue Joker)\n\n\n- My joker slots are completely full, so any new joker would require selling an existing one\n\nWith $7 available, I need to decide between purchasing a new joker (which requires a swap), buying cards to strengthen my deck, or rerolling to find better options. The Crazy Joker and Clever Joker both require selling a joker first, and neither synergizes well with my current hand strategy—I rarely play straights or two pairs. The Jumbo Pack could add a useful card for $6, leaving me with $1, or I could reroll the shop for $5 to see if better options appear. I have a Pluto consumable that levels up High Card. I could sell it for $1, giving me $8 total. Then I could buy the Mega Standard Pack for $8 exactly, or grab the Jumbo Pack for $6 and keep $2. But at Ante 5, chip requirements are escalating fast, so I'm leaning toward saving my $7 for future shops where I might find better jokers or planets to strengthen my pair strategy. A single card from these packs could be enhanced or have a useful edition, but it's not guaranteed enough to justify spending down my resources now.","action":"\"round_select\""}
