{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 11\n- Game Step: SHOP (just won the Small Blind)\n- Money: $13\n- Next blind will be the Big Blind\n\n**Inventory:**\n- 5 Jokers (at max capacity):\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n  3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n  4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace scored\n  5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n- 1 Consumable: Pluto (level up High Card)\n- 1 Voucher: Grabber\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Runner - Gains +15 Chips if played hand contains a Straight ($5)\n  2. Credit Card - Go up to -$20 in debt ($1)\n- Boosters:\n  1. Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6)\n  2. Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)\n- Voucher:\n  1. Director's Cut - Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante ($10)\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my performance:\n- I'm heavily relying on Pairs (played 13 times at Level 6: 85 chips, 7 mult)\n- My recent scores have been good: 4,225, 2,505, 7,602 chips\n- I'm on Ante 5/8, which means I need to prepare for increasingly difficult blinds\n\nMy joker setup is decent but not amazing:\n- Smiley Face is useful for face card pairs\n- Blue Joker gives a solid +104 chips\n\n\n- Jolly Joker synergizes well with my pair strategy, Scholar boosts aces, and Fibonacci triggers on multiple ranks\n\n**Evaluation of shop options:**\n\nRunner doesn't fit my pair-focused approach, and Credit Card seems unnecessary right now. The Jumbo Arcana Pack could provide useful tarot effects to strengthen my deck or jokers, though I should consider whether the cost is justified given my current momentum.\n\nWith $13 available, I'm weighing several paths: spending $6 on either pack leaves me with $7 for future rounds, Director's Cut at $10 gives me boss flexibility but leaves minimal funds, or a $5 reroll might surface better jokers. Since I'm approaching Ante 5 where the Big Blind becomes substantially more challenging than the Small Blind, I need to decide whether to invest in immediate power or preserve flexibility for tougher rounds ahead.\n\nMy current joker collection lacks multiplicative effects—they're mostly additive, which limits my scaling potential. The Jumbo Arcana Pack appeals because tarot cards can fundamentally transform my deck through card enhancements or joker editions. However, I'm second-guessing this choice since my jokers are all basic commons and might benefit more from rerolling to find stronger options. The real question is whether I should chase better jokers now or enhance what I already have.\n\nThe Arcana Pack offers certainty though—I'll get five tarot options to work with. That's more reliable than hoping a reroll yields something worthwhile. I'm going to commit to the pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
