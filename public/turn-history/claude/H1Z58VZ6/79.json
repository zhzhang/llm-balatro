{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 9\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Blind: Boss\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Boss Description: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\"\n- Reward: $5\n- Money: $0\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (currently)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - my main strategy\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n\n**Boss Blind Effect:**\n\"in 7 cards get drawn face down\" - This is The Serpent boss blind. It causes 7 cards to be drawn face down each time you draw cards. This makes it difficult to see what cards you have, making it harder to form hands strategically.\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\n- Pair - 5,221 chips\n- Three of a Kind - 5,880 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe boss blind requires 10,000 chips. Looking at my recent hands:\n- My last pair scored 5,221 chips\n- My last three of a kind scored 5,880 chips\n\nThe boss effect draws 7 cards face down, which means I won't be able to see what cards I have initially. This is challenging but manageable - I'll need to play conservatively and carefully reveal cards.\n\n\nI have the Grabber voucher providing an extra hand per round, giving me 4 total hands to work with. Since my pairs and three of a kinds are consistently scoring in the 5,000-6,000 range, I should be able to hit 10,000 chips within 2-3 hands. I need to play this round since boss blinds can't be skipped, so I'll focus on identifying pairs first and leveraging my available hands strategically.\n\nWhen revealing cards, I'll prioritize aces for Scholar synergy and Fibonacci numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 8. Face cards work well too given my Smiley Face synergy. I can use discards to uncover face-down cards and improve my hand selection. The only viable action here is to play_round and enter the blind.","action":"\"play_round\""}
