{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8 (halfway through game)\n- Round: 9\n- Money: $0\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Owned Consumables: Pluto (level up High Card) and Venus (level up Three of a Kind)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- To Do List joker - $4 (I don't have money)\n- Spectral Pack - $4 (I don't have money)\n- No vouchers\n- Reroll costs $5 (I don't have money)\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card\n2. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - My main strategy\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult)\n- High Card: Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $0 and cannot buy anything from the shop. My options are:\n1. Use my consumables (Pluto or Venus)\n2. Sell my consumables\n3. Rearrange jokers (probably not needed)\n4. Sell jokers (to get money)\n5. Go to round select\n\nI need to decide:\n- Should I use the planet cards now or save them?\n- Should I sell consumables for money?\n- Should I just proceed to the Boss Blind?\n\n\n- Venus would boost Three of a Kind from 70 chips/7 mult to 90 chips/9 mult, which helps since I play it fairly often as a backup. Pluto would only improve High Card to 15 chips/2 mult, but I rarely use that hand type, so it's less valuable.\n\nSelling the consumables would only net $2, which doesn't seem worth losing the hand upgrades. The real question is whether I should use Venus now to strengthen my backup hand before facing the Boss Blind, or hold onto both consumables for later flexibility.\n\nThree of a Kind has proven useful—I've played it four times already—and leveling it up would add meaningful scoring power. With the Boss Blind approaching, having that stronger backup feels important if my pair strategy falters. Pluto's less critical since I rarely use High Card anyway.\n\nI'm leaning toward using Venus immediately to boost Three of a Kind, then deciding whether to keep or sell Pluto. A single dollar from selling it won't unlock anything in the shop, so holding it might be the better call.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
