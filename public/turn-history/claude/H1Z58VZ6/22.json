{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $1\n- Joker: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n- Boss Blind: All Spade cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Key Information:**\n- I have one joker: Smiley Face\n- Boss blind debuffs all Spade cards\n- I need 600 chips to win\n- I have no consumables\n- Current money: $1\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3\n- Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4\n- Other hands: Level 1\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Flush - 1,036 chips (won Big Blind)\n- Three of a Kind - 189 chips and 171 chips\n- Pair - 60 chips\n- Two Pair - 108 chips\n- High Card - 90 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\nThis is a Boss Blind that debuffs all Spade cards. I need to play around this by avoiding Spades or being prepared for them to not contribute chips or trigger effects.\n\nBoss blinds cannot be skipped, so my only option is to play_round.\n\nThe boss effect means:\n- Spade cards won't contribute their chip values\n- Spade cards won't trigger effects like Smiley Face (+5 Mult for face cards)\n- But Spades can still form hand types (e.g., a pair of Spade Kings still counts as a pair)\n\nWith 600 chips needed, I should be able to handle this. My Three of a Kind at Level 2 gives 50 base chips and 5 base mult. If I can form a Three of a Kind with non-Spade face cards, I should be able to get good value from Smiley Face as well.\n\n\nI'll proceed with play_round since this blind must be faced and I have the tools to work around the Spade debuff.","action":"\"play_round\""}
