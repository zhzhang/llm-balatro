{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 12 - About to face Boss Blind\n- Money: $9\n- Just sold Smiley Face joker for $2\n\n**Current Jokers (4/5):**\n1. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n2. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n3. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace\n4. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Showman ($5) - Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n- Wily Joker ($4) - +100 Chips if Three of a Kind\n- Arcana Pack ($4)\n- Director's Cut voucher ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - 16 plays (most played)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 5 (110 chips, 11 mult) - 5 plays\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nThe previous action was to sell Smiley Face to make room for Wily Joker. This makes sense because:\n1. I just leveled Three of a Kind to Level 5\n2. Wily Joker adds +100 chips to Three of a Kind\n3. I have space for one more joker (4/5)\n\nWith $9, I can:\n1. Buy Wily Joker for $4, leaving $5\n2. Buy Showman for $5, leaving $4\n3. Buy Arcana Pack for $4, leaving $5\n4. Reroll for $5, leaving $4\n5. Save money and proceed to Boss Blind\n\nGiven my previous reasoning was to buy Wily Joker to strengthen Three of a Kind, and I have the money and space for it, I should buy Wily Joker now.\n\n\nAdding Wily Joker to a Three of a Kind hand would give me significant scaling: the base 110 chips becomes 314 with Blue Joker and Wily Joker combined, and if I hit Fibonacci cards (Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8), I could stack up to 43 multiplier total with Jolly Joker and multiple Fibonacci bonuses. This creates a much stronger scoring potential for the remaining antes.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
