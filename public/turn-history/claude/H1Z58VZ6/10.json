{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (just finished Small Blind)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $4\n- Jokers: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n\n**Blind Select Options:**\n1. **Big Blind**: \n   - Chips Needed: 450\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Tag for skipping: Foil Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n\n2. **Boss Blind** (upcoming):\n   - Chips Needed: 600\n   - Boss Description: All Spade cards are debuffed\n   - Reward: $5\n   - Cannot be skipped\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need to decide whether to play the Big Blind or skip it for the Foil Tag.\n\n**Option 1: Play the Big Blind**\n- Need to score 450 chips\n- I have Smiley Face joker which gives +5 Mult per face card played\n- My recent hands scored: Pair (60), Three of a Kind (171), Two Pair (108)\n- If I play the Big Blind and win, I get $4, bringing me to $8 total\n- I also get interest (up to $1 per $5 I have, max $5 interest)\n- Then I can shop before the Boss Blind\n\n**Can I beat 450 chips?**\nLet me estimate:\n- Three of a Kind scored 171 chips in Small Blind\n- With Smiley Face, if I play 3 face cards in Three of a Kind: 30 base chips + (3 face cards × 10 chips each) = 60 chips, times (3 base mult + 15 mult from Smiley Face) = 60 × 18 = 1,080 chips\n\n\n- Two Pair with face cards would yield 60 × 22 = 1,320 chips, and even just a Pair of face cards gives 30 × 12 = 360 chips. I should comfortably exceed 450 chips with most reasonable hands.\n\nAlternatively, I could pursue the Foil Tag, which grants a free Foil edition Joker in the next shop—saving me $4-6 on a purchase. However, this means forgoing the $4 reward and skipping the shop before facing the Boss Blind, going straight into that challenge without additional preparation.\n\nThe Boss Blind specifically debuffs all Spades, preventing them from contributing chips or triggering effects, though they still count toward hand formation. This is a significant constraint since Spades represent a quarter of the deck.\n\nPlaying through the Big Blind gives me the $4 reward plus a shopping opportunity before the Boss, letting me potentially acquire another Joker or upgrade. With Smiley Face generating substantial chips from face card pairs, I can comfortably meet the 600-chip requirement. The immediate $8 total and shop access outweigh the delayed savings from Foil Tag—I need power now, not later.\n\nSince the Boss debuffs Spades, having more tools to leverage the other suits becomes critical.","action":"\"play_round\""}
