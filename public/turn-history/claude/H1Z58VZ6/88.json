{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Current Blind: Small Blind\n- Chips Needed: 11,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 5\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $7\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2: King of Spades (+10 chips)\n3: Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n4: 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n5: 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n6: 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7: 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n8: 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +88 Chips (currently)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n\nI have a pair of 5s (positions 4 and 6):\n- 5 of Spades (Fibonacci number)\n- 5 of Clubs (Fibonacci number)\n\nLet me calculate the score for playing the pair of 5s:\n- Base pair (Level 6): 85 chips, 7 mult\n- Cards participating in the pair: 5 + 5 = 10 chips\n- Blue Joker: +88 chips\n- Total chips: 85 + 10 + 88 = 183 chips\n\n\n- Multiplier breakdown: 7 base + 8 from Jolly Joker + 8 from Fibonacci on each 5 = 31 mult\n- Final score: 183 × 31 = 5,673 chips\n\nNow checking the pair of 2s (positions 5 and 7):\n- 2 of Spades (Fibonacci number)\n- 2 of Clubs (Fibonacci number)\n\nThe pair yields 85 base chips plus 4 from the cards themselves and 88 from Blue Joker, totaling 177 chips. With the same 31 mult applied, this gives 177 × 31 = 5,487 chips—weaker than the first hand.\n\nI should also consider a flush using all five spades: Ace, King, Jack, 5, and 2.\n\nA flush (Level 1) provides 35 base chips. The five cards contribute 38 chips (Ace 11, King 10, Jack 10, 5, and 2). Adding Blue Joker's 88 chips brings the total to 161 chips. The multiplier comes from Smiley Face triggering on the King and Jack (+5 each), Scholar on the Ace (+4), and Fibonacci bonuses on the Ace, 5, and 2 (+8 each), yielding 42 mult total. This scores 161 × 42.\n\nThat gives me 6,762 chips—better than the pair options. With five hands left and needing 11,000 total, playing the flush now leaves about 4,238 chips to earn on the final hand. I'll select all five spades.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
