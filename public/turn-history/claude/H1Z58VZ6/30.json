{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Boss round coming up)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $0\n- Owned Jokers: \n  1. Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per scored face card)\n  2. Square Joker (gains +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards, currently 0 chips)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (can have 3 more)\n- No consumables\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Ride the Bus - $6 (can't afford)\n2. Mega Standard Pack - $8 (can't afford)\n3. Telescope Voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n4. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI have $0 and can't afford anything in the shop. The only actions I can take are:\n- sell_joker (to get money to buy something)\n- sell_consumable (but I don't have any)\n- rearrange_jokers (to reorder my jokers)\n- round_select (to proceed to the next phase)\n\nSince I'm broke and can't buy anything, I should proceed to the blind selection. I just bought the Square Joker which will help me in the upcoming boss round.\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7 (most reliable hand)\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3\n- Other hands mostly Level 1\n\nI'm well-prepared for the boss round with two jokers and a strong Three of a Kind hand. There's no reason to sell either joker or wait in the shop since I can't afford anything.\n\nThe best action is to use the `round_select` command to proceed to the blind selection for the boss round.","action":"\"round_select\""}
