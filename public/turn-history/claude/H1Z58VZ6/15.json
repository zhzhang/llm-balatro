Next blind is the Boss Blind which debuffs all Spades\\n2. Smiley Face gives +5 Mult for each played FACE CARD that scores\\n3. Face cards are Jack, Queen, King (NOT Aces)\\n\\n**Possible Hands:**\\n\\n**Option 1: Three of a Kind (Aces) - positions 3, 4, 7**\\n\\n\\nPlaying the three Aces gives 30 base chips with 3x multiplier. Adding their individual values (11 each) totals 63 chips scored, resulting in 189 chips final. Since Aces don't count as face cards, there's no Smiley Face bonus, and this falls short of the 450 needed.\\n\\n**Option 2: Pair of Aces + King and Queen for Two Pair**\\nI can't form two pair this way since I only have one Queen available.\\n\\n**Option 3: Two Pair with Queen and King?**\\nDifferent ranks can't pair, so this won't work.\\n\\n**Option 4: High Card**\\nToo weak to be viable.\\n\\nWith only 4 hands left and needing 450 chips, the three Aces at 189 chips is my strongest play so far but still falls short. I need to consider discarding strategically\\u2014the Queen of Spades will be debuffed next round, the King of Diamonds synergizes with Smiley Face, and the Aces form my best current hand despite lacking the face card bonus.\\n\\nA pair of face cards would score differently. Two Kings would give 30 base chips, plus 20 from the cards themselves, then Smiley Face adds 10 mult (5 per face card), totaling 360 chips\\u2014better than the Aces but still below my target. If I could assemble two pairs of face cards instead, the multiplier stacking would push me closer to 450.\\n\\nTwo pairs would yield 60 chips with 22 total mult (the base 2 plus 20 from Smiley Face), reaching 1,320 chips\\u2014a significant jump. The challenge is drawing enough face cards to make this happen. Three of a kind with face cards offers another path, giving me 60 chips and 3 base mult before Smiley Face kicks in.\\n\\nI'm going to discard the weakest cards\\u2014the 9 of Spades, 4 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs\\u2014to make room for higher-value cards. This keeps my three Aces and the Queen and King of Diamonds, leaving me one more discard to work with if needed.\\nCommand: discard 2 5 6\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 14]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Smiley Face.

Only the King would score its chips, and only it would trigger Smiley Face. This gives me a choice: go with the three Aces for 189 chips now, leaving me 261 short with three hands remaining, or use my two remaining discards to try improving the face card combination. Discarding the 2 of Spades and 7 of Clubs could help me draw better cards to pair with the Queen and King.\\n\\nThe real challenge is that I currently have just two face cards of different ranks, so they can't form a pair. A pair of Kings would yield 30 chips with 12 multiplier for 360 total\\u2014significantly stronger than what I'd get from the Queen-King combination. Two pair with face cards would be even more valuable, so I should focus on whether the remaining discards give me a realistic shot at that outcome.\\n\\nI have 4 hands left and 2 discards remaining. Using one now leaves me with just 1 discard for the final hand. My current best is Three of a Kind with Aces at 189 chips, meaning I need 261 more across my last 3 hands. The deck still contains 3 Queens, 4 Jacks, and 3 Kings, so there's potential to build stronger combinations if I'm willing to discard the weak cards (2 of Spades, 7 of Clubs, 5 of Diamonds) and chase higher-value draws.\\nCommand: discard 2 5 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 15]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Smiley Face.

Cards outside the hand don't activate their effects\\u2014only participating cards do. In a High Card hand, just the King participates, so only it triggers Smiley Face. The Queen and Jack wouldn't contribute to the multiplier at all. That means the calculation should be: 15 chips \\u00d7 6 mult (1 base + 5 from King's Smiley Face) = 90 chips total.\\n\\nThat's significantly worse than the Three of a Kind with Aces. I should compare my options: playing the Aces now gives me 189 chips and leaves 261 needed across 3 remaining hands, averaging 87 per hand. Alternatively, I could use my last discard to swap out the weak cards and hope to draw another face card for a pair, though a pair of face cards would only score around 20 chips plus multipliers\\u2014likely not enough to justify the risk. d King. So any face card I draw could match one I'm holding.\\n\\nLet me think through the odds more carefully. I need a Queen, Jack, or King to pair with what I already have\\u2014that's 9 matching cards out of 34 remaining. Drawing 2 cards gives me a reasonable shot at hitting at least one pair. However, I could also just lock in the three Aces for 189 chips now and use my remaining hands to chase something better. The safer play might be securing that guaranteed score rather than gambling on face card draws.\\n\\nPlaying the Aces now guarantees 189 chips, leaving me 261 to find across three more hands. If I discard and miss, I lose a hand without gaining anything.\\nCommand: play 2 5 6 three of a kind 189\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Smiley Face.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- Blind: Big Blind, need 450 chips\n- Current chips: 189 (need 261 more)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 1\n- Money: $4\n- Joker: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2: Queen of Spades (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n3: Jack of Hearts (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n4: 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n5: 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n6: 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n7: King of Diamonds (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\n8: 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI have three face cards of different ranks (Queen, Jack, King), so I can't make a pair of face cards.\n\nLet me evaluate possible hands:\n\n1. **Hearts Flush (positions 3, 4, 5, 6)**: Jack, 8, 7, 4\n   - Base: 35 chips, 4 mult\n   - Cards scored: 10 + 8 + 7 + 4 = 29 chips\n   - Total chips: 35 + 29 = 64 chips\n   - Jack is a face card, triggers Smiley Face for +5 mult\n   - Final mult: 4 + 5 = 9 mult\n   - Final: 64 × 9 = 576 chips!\n\nThis is HUGE! This alone would be enough to win the round (189 + 576 = 765 chips, which exceeds the 450 needed).\n\nLet me double-check this:\n\n\nPlaying the four Hearts gives me a flush with 35 base chips and 4x multiplier. The Jack contributes 10 chips along with the 8, 7, and 4 for a total of 29 additional chips, bringing me to 64 chips before multiplier. Since the Jack triggers Smiley Face, I gain an extra 5 multiplier, making it 9x total, which yields 576 chips—more than enough to clear the blind.\n\nActually, wait. A flush requires five cards of the same suit, and I only have four Hearts available. That won't work. I need to explore other hand combinations instead. Looking at what I have, there are no pairs to make Two Pair, so my best option appears to be playing the three face cards as a High Card with the King as the high card.\n\nBut I'm second-guessing how the scoring works here. When multiple cards are played together but only one participates in the hand type, do all the face cards trigger their bonuses, or just the one that actually scores? The rules state that played face cards give +5 Mult when scored—the word \"scored\" suggests only cards that contribute to the hand type get their effects. In a High Card hand, only the highest card participates, so only that card's bonuses would apply.\n\nTesting this with Queen, Jack, and King: the King wins as the high card, so it's the only one that scores and triggers Smiley Face. That gives 15 chips and 6 mult for a final of 90 chips.\n\nNow I'm checking if a straight is possible. I have Ace, Queen, Jack, 8, 7, 6, 4, and King. A straight needs five consecutive ranks, but looking at what I have—4, 6, 7, 8 are there, but I'm missing the 5, so that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if I just play each face card individually instead? Each one would score the same way as before—90 chips per hand. With three hands remaining and needing 261 more chips, playing them separately would give me 270 chips total, which gets me over the threshold.\n\nBut I should consider if there's a better approach. I have four hearts right now—Jack, 8, 7, 4—and only need one more to complete a flush. With six hearts still in the remaining deck, using my last discard to chase that fifth heart could potentially yield a much higher score than the safe play.\n\nHowever, the probability isn't guaranteed, and I'm already positioned to win. Playing it safe with high cards like the King of Diamonds makes more sense given that I've already secured enough chips to clinch the game."
