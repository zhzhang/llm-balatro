{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BUFFOON_PACK (selecting from booster pack)\n- Current Money: $1\n- I have 4 jokers (max 5), so I can add one more\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently +4 Chips)\n3. Red Card - +3 Mult when booster pack skipped (currently +0 Mult)\n4. Blue Joker - +2 Chips per remaining card in deck (currently +104 Chips)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Greedy Joker - Played cards with Diamond suit give +3 Mult when scored (Common)\n2. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair (Common)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my hand history:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, played 3 times (my most played hand)\n- Pair: Level 2, played 3 times (also frequently played)\n- Straight: played 1 time\n- Flush: played 1 time\n- High Card: played 2 times\n- Two Pair: played 1 time\n\nJolly Joker gives +8 Mult if the played hand contains a Pair. This is important - \"contains\" means any hand that includes a pair would trigger this, including:\n- Pair\n- Two Pair\n- Three of a Kind (contains a pair)\n- Full House (contains a pair)\n- Four of a Kind (contains a pair)\n- Five of a Kind (contains a pair)\n\nThis is extremely versatile! Since I've been playing Three of a Kind frequently (3 times at level 3), and it contains a pair, Jolly Joker would trigger on those hands. It would also trigger on my Pair hands, which I've also played 3 times.\n\n\nGreedy Joker requires Diamond cards in my hand and only grants +3 Mult per Diamond scored, making it far more restrictive. Jolly Joker's +8 Mult triggers consistently across most of my played hands, particularly the Three of a Kind and Pair combinations I rely on most frequently.\n\nI'm going with Jolly Joker at position 2.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
