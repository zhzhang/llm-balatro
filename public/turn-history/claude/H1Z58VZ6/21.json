{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2 (in the shop after beating Big Blind)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $1\n- Joker: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 1)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Jokers:\n  1. Mail-In Rebate - Earn $5 for each discarded 3, rank changes every round. Cost: $4\n  2. Square Joker - Gains +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently 0 chips). Cost: $4\n- Boosters: None\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently. Cost: $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels (after recent upgrades):**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5, Times Played 2\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3, Times Played 1\n- Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4, Times Played 1\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Flush - 1,036 chips (won the Big Blind)\n- Three of a Kind - 189 chips and 171 chips\n- Pair - 60 chips\n- Two Pair - 108 chips\n- High Card - 90 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $1 left. I cannot afford:\n- Mail-In Rebate ($4)\n- Square Joker ($4)\n- Tarot Merchant ($10)\n- Reroll ($5)\n\nMy options are extremely limited:\n\n\nSince nothing is purchasable with my current funds and I have no consumables or extra jokers to liquidate, I'll proceed directly to the next round. The Smiley Face joker has been performing well with face cards, and my Three of a Kind and Pair hands are leveled up enough to carry me forward.","action":"\"round_select\""}
