{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8 (halfway through the game)\n- Money: $14\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2 (empty)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. To Do List - $4 - Earn $4 if poker hand is Full House\n2. Spectral Pack - $4\n3. Arcana Pack - $4\n4. Grabber voucher - $10 - Permanently gain +1 hand per round\n\n**My previous plan was to:**\n1. ✓ Sell Square Joker (done)\n2. ✓ Buy Fibonacci for free (done)\n3. Buy Grabber voucher for $10\n\nI now have $14 and should buy the Grabber voucher for $10, which will leave me with $4.\n\nThe Grabber voucher is extremely valuable because:\n- It permanently adds +1 hand per round\n- More hands = more flexibility and chances to win rounds\n- This is especially valuable as the game gets harder in later antes\n- It's a permanent upgrade that will benefit me for the rest of the run\n\nAfter buying Grabber, I'll have $4 left. With that, I could:\n- Buy To Do List for $4 (but I don't play Full House often)\n- Buy a Spectral Pack or Arcana Pack for $4 (could be useful for deck manipulation/upgrades)\n\n\n- Hold onto the remaining funds for future shop opportunities\n\nI'll go ahead and purchase the Grabber voucher now.","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
