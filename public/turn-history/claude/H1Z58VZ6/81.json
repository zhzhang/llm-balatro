{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 10\n- Current Blind: Boss (The Serpent - 7 cards drawn face down)\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 5\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Money: $0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: King of Spades (+10 chips) - face card\n2: Queen of Spades (+10 chips) - face card\n3: Unknown (face down)\n4: 2 of Spades (+2 chips) - Fibonacci number\n5: 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n6: 5 of Hearts (+5 chips) - Fibonacci number\n7: 3 of Hearts (+3 chips) - Fibonacci number\n8: Unknown (face down)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +80 Chips (currently)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have two unknown cards (positions 3 and 8). Let me look at the visible cards:\n- King of Spades (face card, triggers Smiley Face)\n- Queen of Spades (face card, triggers Smiley Face)\n- 2 of Spades (Fibonacci, triggers Fibonacci joker)\n- 9 of Hearts\n\n\n- 5 of Hearts (Fibonacci, triggers Fibonacci joker)\n- 3 of Hearts (Fibonacci, triggers Fibonacci joker)\n\nMy visible cards don't form any pairs yet. I should discard the two face-down cards to reveal what I'm working with, then decide on the best scoring combination. I'll discard positions 3 and 8.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,8]"}
