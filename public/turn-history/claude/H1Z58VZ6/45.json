{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (about to enter Ante 3)\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $10\n- Jokers: 4/5 (one slot available after selling Red Card)\n  1. Smiley Face (+5 Mult per face card) - $2\n  2. Square Joker (+8 Chips for 4-card hands) - $2\n  3. Blue Joker (+104 Chips, +2 per remaining deck card) - $2\n  4. Jolly Joker (+8 Mult if hand contains pair) - $1\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- The Magician (Tarot): $3 - Enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards\n- Scholar (Joker): $4 - Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n- Jumbo Celestial Pack: $6 - Choose 1 of 5 Planet cards\n- Standard Pack: $4 - Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards\n- Telescope (Voucher): $10 - Celestial Packs always contain most played hand's planet\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Hand Level Analysis:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - played 3 times\n- Pair: Level 2 (25 chips, 3 mult) - played 4 times (MOST PLAYED)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - played 2 times\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI now have exactly $10, which opens up some key decisions:\n\n1. **Telescope Voucher ($10)**: This would guarantee that all future Celestial Packs contain the planet for my most-played hand. Since Pair has been played 4 times (most), this would guarantee \"pair\" planets in future packs. This is a long-term investment that pays off over many shops.\n\n\n2. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6) + Scholar ($4) = $10**: I could immediately level up a hand while also giving my remaining Aces +20 Chips and +4 Mult when they score—solid immediate returns.\n3. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6) + The Magician ($3) = $9**: This path levels a hand now and converts 2 cards to Lucky Cards for potential RNG upside.\n\nRecent scoring suggests hands are hitting around 1,400-1,480 chips in Ante 2, so I need to weigh whether immediate hand leveling or long-term voucher value serves me better heading into higher antes.\n\nPair has been my most-played hand at 4 times, followed by Three of a Kind at 3 times. Telescope would guarantee future Pair planets, but that feels like delayed power when I need to spike my damage now. The Jumbo Celestial Pack + Scholar combo gives me the immediate boost I'm after—leveling my strongest hand while Scholar's synergy with my Aces provides meaningful chip and mult scaling that aligns with my pair-heavy strategy.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
