{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 12 - About to face Boss Blind\n- Money: $5\n- Just bought Wily Joker\n\n**Current Jokers (5/5 - at max):**\n1. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (constant)\n2. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n3. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace\n4. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n5. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if Three of a Kind\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Showman ($5) - Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n- Arcana Pack ($4)\n- Director's Cut voucher ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - 16 plays (most played)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 5 (110 chips, 11 mult) - 5 plays\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI have $5 left. My options are:\n1. Buy Showman for $5 (exact money) - This would allow duplicates in future shops\n2. Buy Arcana Pack for $4 (leaves $1) - Random tarot card effect\n3. Reroll for $5 (leaves $0) - See new shop options\n4. Save money and proceed to Boss Blind - Keep $5 for after the round\n\nLet me think about what I need:\n- I'm about to face Boss Blind of Ante 5, which is a significant challenge\n- I have a solid setup with Two of a Kind synergy (Blue Joker + Wily Joker = +204 chips base) and Pair synergy (Jolly Joker)\n\n\n- Pair has been my most reliable hand at 16 plays, scoring between 4,600-7,700 chips consistently\n- Three of a Kind is less frequent but now much stronger with Wily Joker added, though it only scored 2,873 before the upgrade\n- With Wily Joker, Three of a Kind now generates 314 base chips (110 + 104 + 100), and if I can hit Fibonacci triggers with Ace/2/3/5/8, the multiplier stacks significantly\n\n—three Aces alone adds 60 chips and 12 multiplier, pushing a full Three of a Kind hand to around 20,570 chips\n- Pair remains solid at 189 base chips with Fibonacci or Ace variants reaching roughly 8,900-9,000 chips depending on the combination\n\nThree of a Kind is now significantly more powerful than Pair when the right cards align. For my final $5, I'm weighing Showman to unlock duplicate planet cards across future shops—which would strengthen my key hands through repeated leveling—against Arcana Pack's random card enhancements or a reroll with no remaining funds. Showman feels like the better long-term play since I can't afford much else and duplicates would compound my scoring potential.\n\nActually, I should save the $5 for the next shop. I'll earn $1 in interest from holding it, plus whatever money comes from leftover hands and discards after beating the Boss Blind. My joker setup is already solid for executing both Pair and Three of a Kind strategies, so I don't need to invest now—I should focus on clearing this blind first and enter the next shop with more capital to work with.","action":"\"round_select\""}
