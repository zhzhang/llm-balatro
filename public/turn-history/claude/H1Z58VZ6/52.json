{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $6\n- Jokers: 5/5 (at max capacity)\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 3000 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Boss Blind: 4000 chips needed, $5 reward, All Diamond cards are debuffed\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. DNA (Rare Joker) - $8 - If first hand of round has only 1 card, add a permanent copy to deck and draw it to hand\n2. Lusty Joker (Common) - $5 - Played cards with Heart suit give +3 Mult when scored\n3. Buffoon Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n4. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n5. Telescope Voucher - $10 - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for your most played poker hand\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 3 (most played - 5 times)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (played 3 times)\n- Others mostly at Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $6 to spend. Let me consider my options:\n\n1. **Lusty Joker ($5)** - But I'm at max jokers, so I'd need to sell one first. This gives +3 Mult per Heart card scored, which could be okay but not amazing with my current strategy.\n\n\n2. **Buffoon Pack ($4)** - Since I'm at capacity, I'd need to remove a joker to make room. This could unlock better joker options. **Celestial Pack ($4)** - Leveling up my most-played hand (Pair at Level 3) would significantly increase chip and mult gains. **DNA and Telescope** are both out of budget. A reroll at $5 might show different options, but with limited funds, I should focus on what's available now.\n\nMy pair-focused setup is working well—Jolly Joker, Smiley Face, Scholar, Blue Joker, and Square Joker all synergize around pairs and face cards. My last pair hit 3,212 chips, clearing the Big Blind but falling short against the Boss Blind's 4,000 chip requirement, especially with the Diamond debuff reducing effectiveness.\n\nThe Celestial Pack at $4 is the strongest move here. Leveling up Pair or Three of a Kind would boost my base scoring for hands I'm already playing frequently. I'd have $2 remaining to generate interest in the next shop. Skipping the purchase entirely means missing out on the hand level improvements I'll need for the harder rounds ahead.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
