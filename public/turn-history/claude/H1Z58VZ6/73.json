{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8 (halfway through the game)\n- Money: $14\n- Joker slots: 4/5 (one slot open after selling Square Joker)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2 (empty)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Fibonacci - FREE (was uncommon tag item) - +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n2. To Do List - $4 - Earn $4 if poker hand is Full House\n3. Spectral Pack - $4\n4. Arcana Pack - $4\n5. Grabber voucher - $10 - Permanently gain +1 hand per round\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy previous reasoning was to:\n1. Sell Square Joker (done) - now have $14\n2. Buy Fibonacci for free\n3. Buy Grabber voucher for $10\n\nThis still seems like a solid plan. Let me verify:\n\n**Fibonacci synergy:**\n- I frequently play pairs\n- Scholar already boosts aces (+20 chips, +4 mult per ace)\n- Fibonacci would add +8 mult per ace played\n- If I play a pair of aces: +16 mult from Fibonacci, +8 mult from Scholar = +24 mult total just from the aces\n- This stacks incredibly well with my existing setup\n\n**Grabber voucher:**\n- Permanently gain +1 hand per round\n- This is a massive quality of life improvement\n- More hands means more opportunities to find the right cards\n\n\n- Gives me greater flexibility in hand selection and costs $10, which fits my budget\n\n**My plan:**\n1. Grab Fibonacci at no cost (leaves $14)\n2. Purchase Grabber for $10 (leaves $4)\n\nThis positions me well for the remaining antes with a strengthened joker lineup. To Do List doesn't align with my hand patterns, and the pack options would leave me with minimal funds afterward.\n\nI'll go ahead and buy Fibonacci first.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
