{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (just finished Small Blind)\n- Currently in SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $8\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Max Jokers: 5, Max Consumables: 2\n\n**Shop Available:**\n1. Mars (Planet card) - Levels up Four of a Kind, +3 Mult and +30 chips, Cost: $3\n2. The Chariot (Tarot card) - Enhances 1 card into Steel Card (X1.5 Mult while in hand), Cost: $3\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards, Cost: $4\n2. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to use immediately, Cost: $4\n\n**Voucher:**\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently, Cost: $10\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $5\n\n**Hand Levels Currently:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, played 1 time\n- Two Pair: Level 1, played 1 time  \n- Pair: Level 1, played 1 time\n- All others at Level 1, not played yet\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at Ante 1/8, so this is very early in the game. I need to build a strong foundation. Let me think about what's most valuable:\n\n1. **Buffoon Pack ($4)** - This gives me a choice between 2 joker cards. Jokers are extremely valuable as they provide ongoing benefits throughout the run. This is probably the best value option.\n\n2. **Mars ($3)** - Leveling up Four of a Kind could be useful, but I haven't played any four of a kinds yet, so this feels premature.\n\n\nThe Chariot and Celestial Pack both cost $4 like the Buffoon Pack, but neither offers the sustained value of a joker. The Chariot's one-time steel enhancement is limited, while Celestial Pack helps level hands I'm already using. Tarot Merchant at $10 is out of reach with my current funds. Rerolling for $5 would leave me with only $3, which isn't enough for most meaningful purchases.\n\nSince jokers compound in value throughout a run, the Buffoon Pack is the strongest investment. I can grab it for $4 and either pair it with a $3 card or bank the remaining $4 for future opportunities.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
