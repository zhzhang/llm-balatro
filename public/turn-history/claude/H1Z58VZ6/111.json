{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n5. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n6. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n7. Jack of Clubs (debuffed)\n8. 7 of Clubs (debuffed)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +82 Chips (constant)\n2. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if pair\n3. Scholar: +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace when scored\n4. Fibonacci: +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 when scored\n5. Wily Joker: +100 Chips if Three of a Kind\n\n**Boss Blind:** All Club cards are debuffed\n**Chips Needed:** 22,000\n**Current Chips:** 0\n**Remaining hands:** 5\n**Remaining discards:** 3\n\n**Available Non-Debuffed Cards:**\n- King of Spades (+10 chips)\n- 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n- 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n- 3 of Spades (+3 chips) - Fibonacci card!\n- 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n- 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n\n**Possible hands:**\n- Pair of 4s (4 of Spades and 4 of Hearts)\n- Spade flush (King, 10, 4, 3 of Spades - need 5 for flush)\n\nThe best hand I can make from the non-debuffed cards is a **Pair of 4s**.\n\n\nPlaying the pair of 4s gives me: 85 base chips plus 82 from Blue Joker, 4 from each 4, and 8 mult from Jolly Joker on top of the base 7 mult. That's 175 chips × 15 mult = 2,625 chips total.\n\nThat's still nowhere near the 22,000 target. I should discard the Club cards and draw fresh ones instead. With 41 cards left in the deck, roughly 80% are non-Clubs, so I have decent odds of improving my hand. The remaining deck has several Aces, twos, threes, fives, and other cards that could form stronger combinations.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [7,8]"}
