{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 10\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Boss (The Serpent - 7 cards drawn face down)\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 5\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2: Unknown (face down)\n3: 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n4: 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n5: 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n6: 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n7: 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n8: 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +88 Chips (deck dependent)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - main strategy\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have one face-down card (position 2). Looking at my visible cards:\n- King of Spades (face card)\n- 2 of Spades (Fibonacci number)\n- 6 of Hearts\n- 5 of Hearts (Fibonacci number)\n- 4 of Hearts\n- 3 of Hearts (Fibonacci number)\n\n\n- 4 of Diamonds\n\nI notice a pair of 4s available (positions 6 and 8). The hearts sequence is particularly interesting—I have 3, 4, 5, 6 of hearts which forms a straight, and if the face-down card is a heart, I could complete a straight flush.\n\nSince I'm at 5,221 chips and need 10,000, I need roughly two more strong hands to reach the goal. Playing the pair of 4s now would give me around 181 chips (85 base + 88 from Blue Joker + 8 from the card values), but discarding the face-down card and drawing fresh could potentially unlock the straight flush if it reveals a 2 or 7 of hearts. - One of the 4s (position 8, the diamond one)\n\nWait, I should reconsider my approach. With 5 hands remaining, I have flexibility to experiment. Let me discard the unknown card, the 6 of Hearts, and both 4s to keep my Fibonacci-synergistic cards—the King, 2, 5, and 3. Actually, being more deliberate: the King gives me face card value through Smiley, the 2 and 5 are both Fibonacci numbers for that bonus, and the 3 completes the sequence.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,4,6,8]"}
