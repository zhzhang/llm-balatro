{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $7\n- Current Blind: Big Blind - Needs 16,500 chips, rewards $4\n- Skip reward: Economy Tag (doubles money, max $40)\n- Upcoming Blind: Boss - Needs 22,000 chips, rewards $5, Boss effect: All Club cards are debuffed\n\n**My Inventory:**\n- 5 Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n  2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n  3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n  4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace scored\n  5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n- 1 Consumable: Pluto (level up High Card)\n- Grabber voucher (+1 hand per round)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy pair strategy has been performing well:\n- Recent pairs: 4,225, 2,505, 4,805, 2,565, 5,115, 5,221 chips\n- Pair is Level 6: 85 base chips, 7 base mult\n- I just converted Kings to Aces with Strength, enhancing Scholar synergy\n\nFor Big Blind (16,500 chips):\n- I need about 4 pairs at ~4,000 chips each to win\n- With Grabber, I should have 5 hands + 3 discards per round\n- This seems achievable with my current setup\n\n**Skip vs Play Decision:**\n\nOption 1: Play the Big Blind\n- Reward: $4\n- Risk: Moderate - need 16,500 chips\n\n\n- Winning gives me roughly $11-12 total (current $7 plus $4 reward and interest), then I'd face the Boss with its Club debuff active\n\nOption 2: Skip for Economy Tag\n- Doubles my money from $7 to $14 (capped at $40)\n- Advances directly to Boss without shopping\n- Boss requires 22,000 chips and debuffs all Club cards\n- Winning nets $5\n\nThe Club debuff is a major concern since my previous hands included several clubs like Ace of Clubs and King of Clubs, which contribute significantly to my scoring.\n\nThe Economy Tag creates a $7 advantage over the Big Blind's $4 reward. However, skipping means I go straight to the Boss fight without any shopping opportunity. My recent pair scores range from 2,505 to 5,221 chips, so reaching 22,000 with debuffed clubs would require at least 4-5 pairs, and losing those card effects could be problematic. Playing the Big Blind now would let me earn $4 and shop with roughly $11, potentially strengthening my deck before facing the Boss.\n\nThe skip path gives me $14 total but forces me into the Boss fight unprepared. The Big Blind path leaves me with less money but provides a crucial shop phase to mitigate the Club debuff risk. Since the Boss is the more dangerous threat, having that preparation opportunity outweighs the extra $3 I'd gain by skipping.","action":"\"play_round\""}
