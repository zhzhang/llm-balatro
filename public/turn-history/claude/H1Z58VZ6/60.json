{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $3\n- Next blind: Boss Blind (4000 chips required, all Diamond cards debuffed)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 5 (70 chips, 6 mult) - Most played (6 times) - JUST UPGRADED\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Egg (Common Joker) - $4 - I only have $3\n- Brainstorm (Rare Joker) - $10 - I only have $3\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack - $6 - I only have $3\n- Telescope Voucher - $10 - I only have $3\n- Reroll Cost: $5 - I only have $3\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just upgraded Pair to Level 5 (70 chips, 6 mult). Let me calculate what I can score now with a pair of face cards (non-diamonds, to avoid the Boss debuff):\n\nFor a pair of face cards (non-diamonds):\n- Base chips: 70 (Pair Level 5)\n- Card chips: 10 + 10 = 20\n- Blue Joker: +104\n- Total chips: 194\n\n- Base mult: 6 (Pair Level 5)\n- Jolly Joker: +8\n- Smiley Face: +10 (2 face cards)\n- Total mult: 24\n\n\n- Score: 194 × 24 = 4,656 chips\n\nThis exceeds the 4000 requirement. With aces instead, I'd get 236 chips and 22 mult (accounting for Scholar bonuses), yielding 5,192 chips—even stronger. Both hands comfortably beat the Boss Blind threshold.\n\nI'm short on cash with only $3, so I can't make any shop purchases. Time to move forward and challenge the Boss Blind with my upgraded Pair.","action":"\"round_select\""}
