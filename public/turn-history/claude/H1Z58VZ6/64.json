{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $11\n- I just beat the Boss Blind of Ante 3\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. To Do List (Foil) - Earn $4 if poker hand is a Four of a Kind, +50 chips - $6\n2. Saturn - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - $4\n2. Jumbo Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards - $6\n\nVoucher:\n1. Grabber - Permanently gain +1 hand per round - $10\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm now in Ante 4/8, which means the chip requirements will be significantly higher. Looking at my hand levels, my primary strategy has been playing Pairs (Level 5, played 7 times). \n\nKey observations:\n1. I have $11, which gives me several options\n2. My joker setup is focused on pairs and face cards\n3. Pair is my highest level hand type (Level 5)\n4. I'm halfway through the run (Ante 4/8)\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Grabber voucher ($10)** - This would give me +1 hand per round permanently. This is very valuable as it gives me more opportunities to score and more flexibility. However, it costs $10, leaving me with only $1.\n\n\n2. **Saturn planet ($3)** - Levels up Straight, but I've only played it once, so it doesn't align with my pair-focused approach.\n3. **To Do List joker ($6)** - Gives +50 chips and $4 for Four of a Kind hands. Since I haven't built toward that hand type yet, this doesn't synergize with my current deck composition.\n4. **Standard Pack ($4)** - Offers flexibility to add useful playing cards to my deck.\n5. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)** - Provides access to planet cards for leveling up hand types.\n6. **Reroll ($5)** - Explore other shop options.\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack stands out as the strongest choice. With five planet cards to choose from, I could potentially find Pluto to directly boost my Pair hand type—my primary scoring engine. Even without it, other planets offer value. This leaves me $5 afterward for Saturn, a reroll, or saving for future rounds.\n\nThough I should reconsider the Grabber voucher more seriously. An extra hand per round becomes increasingly critical as difficulty scales up, and that advantage compounds throughout the run.\n\nBut spending $10 on Grabber leaves only $1 remaining, which cripples my flexibility for the rest of the shop phase. The Jumbo Celestial Pack at $6 achieves my immediate goal of strengthening Pairs while preserving purchasing power. I'll go with that.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
