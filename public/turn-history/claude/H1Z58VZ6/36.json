{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Blind: Big Blind, need 1200 chips\n- Current Chips: 363\n- Remaining chips needed: 1200 - 363 = 837\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current Money: $0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n4. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n5. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6. 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently 4 Chips)\n3. Red Card - +3 Mult when booster pack skipped (currently +0 Mult)\n4. Blue Joker - +2 Chips for each remaining card in deck (currently +64 Chips)\n\n**Analysis of Last Hand:**\nThe last hand was a pair that scored 363 chips. This was much lower than my estimate of 1,573 chips. Let me figure out what happened. The previous hand I played was positions 1, 3, 4, 6 from the previous turn, which was 10♠, Queen♥, 10♥, Jack♣.\n\nLooking at the expected calculation:\n- Base pair chips: 25\n- Two 10s: 20 chips\n- Blue Joker: was +72 chips\n- Square Joker: +4 chips\n\n\n- Total chips: 25 + 20 + 72 + 4 = 121 chips\n\n- Base mult: 3\n- Smiley Face for 2 face cards: +10 mult\n- Total mult: 13\n\nExpected: 121 × 13 = 1,573 chips\n\nBut I only got 363 chips. The issue is likely that Smiley Face didn't activate because the face cards weren't counted as \"scored\" within the pair itself—only the base pair and number cards contributed to the chip total, then multiplied by just the base 3 mult: 121 × 3 = 363 chips.\n\nCards not actively participating in the hand don't trigger their effects. Now looking at my current hand, I have a pair of 7s in positions 3 and 5, plus three clubs and two hearts that don't form a flush. If I play the pair of 7s with exactly four cards total to activate Square Joker, I'd get the base pair chips of 25 plus the two 7s worth 14 chips combined.\n\nAdding the Blue Joker's +64 chips and the Square Joker's permanent +4 chips from last hand gives me 107 chips before multipliers. With a base multiplier of 3, that's 321 chips total, bringing me to 684 overall—still 516 short of my target. I need to find a way to generate 837 more chips.\n\nWith 3 hands remaining, I'm looking at roughly 279 chips per hand on average. A straight could work here—I have the cards for a wheel (A, 2, 3, 4, 5), which would give me 30 base chips plus the card values and the Blue Joker's boost.\n\nThe straight totals 119 chips with a 4x multiplier, yielding 476 chips. Combined with my previous score of 363, that gets me to 839—just enough to hit 1200. I'll play positions 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 for the wheel.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,7,8]"}
