{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (choosing from Celestial Pack)\n- Current Money: $1\n- Joker: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n\n**Planet Card Choices:**\n1. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind: +2 Mult and +20 chips (would make it Level 2: 50 chips, 5 mult)\n2. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind: +3 Mult and +30 chips (would make it Level 2: 90 chips, 10 mult)\n3. Pluto - Level up High Card: +1 Mult and +10 chips (would make it Level 2: 15 chips, 2 mult)\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3, Times Played 2\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 60, Base Mult 7, Times Played 0\n- High Card: Level 1, Base Chips 5, Base Mult 1, Times Played 1\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Flush - 1,036 chips (Big Blind winner)\n- Three of a Kind - 189 chips (twice)\n- High Card - 90 chips\n- Pair - 60 chips\n- Two Pair - 108 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance history:\n- Three of a Kind has been played twice (171 chips and 189 chips), showing it's a hand I can reliably form\n- Four of a Kind hasn't been played yet, and is harder to achieve\n- High Card is a fallback hand, played once for 90 chips\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Venus (Three of a Kind)**: This would upgrade Three of a Kind from 30 chips/3 mult to 50 chips/5 mult. \n\nSince I've already demonstrated success with this hand twice, upgrading it provides immediate value with a proven strategy. Mars offers more raw power with a 90 chip/10 mult upgrade to Four of a Kind, but I haven't landed that hand yet and it's much harder to construct. Pluto's High Card upgrade is minimal and only serves as a backup. Venus feels like the safest choice that builds on what's already working. Four of a Kind requires drawing 4 of the same rank, which is much rarer. Since I'm facing the Boss Blind with minimal resources, I need a hand I can consistently form rather than chase a powerful but unreliable option. Venus is the proven choice here.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
