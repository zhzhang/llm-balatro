{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- I'm facing the Boss Blind requiring 4000 chips\n- Boss effect: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n- Money: $3\n- Reward for beating Boss: $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 5 (70 chips, 6 mult) - Most played (6 times)\n\n**Available Commands:**\n- play_round\n- use_consumable\n- sell_consumable\n- rearrange_jokers\n- sell_joker\n\nI need to decide whether to play the Boss Blind or skip it. However, looking at the context, Boss Blinds cannot be skipped according to the rules stated in the game overview.\n\nLet me calculate my expected scoring capability:\n\nFor a pair of face cards (non-diamonds):\n- Base chips: 70 (Pair Level 5)\n- Card chips: 10 + 10 = 20\n- Blue Joker: +104\n- Total chips: 194\n\n- Base mult: 6 (Pair Level 5)\n- Jolly Joker: +8\n- Smiley Face: +10 (2 face cards × +5 mult each)\n- Total mult: 24\n\nScore: 194 × 24 = 4,656 chips\n\nThis exceeds the 4,000 chip requirement comfortably.\n\nFor a pair of aces (non-diamonds):\n\n\n- Base chips: 70 (Pair Level 5)\n- Card chips: 11 + 11 = 22\n- Scholar: +20 + 20 = +40\n- Blue Joker: +104\n- Total chips: 236\n\n- Base mult: 6 (Pair Level 5)\n- Jolly Joker: +8\n- Scholar: +4 + 4 = +8\n- Total mult: 22\n\nScore: 236 × 22 = 5,192 chips\n\nAces give me even stronger results. I'm ready to play this round since both scoring paths comfortably beat the 4,000 threshold.","action":"\"play_round\""}
