{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Blind: Boss\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Boss Description: Start with 0 discards\n- Reward: $5\n- Current Money: $1\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently +4 Chips)\n3. Red Card - +3 Mult when booster pack skipped (currently +0 Mult)\n4. Blue Joker - +2 Chips per remaining card in deck (currently +104 Chips)\n5. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis is a Boss Blind that starts me with 0 discards. That means I'll need to be very careful with hand selection since I won't have the ability to discard and reposition my cards.\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7 (my strongest hand)\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3\n\nMy last played Three of a Kind hand scored 1,043 chips, which is very close to the 1600 needed. With the Jolly Joker I just added (+8 Mult if hand contains a Pair), my Three of a Kind hands should now score even higher since they contain pairs.\n\nLet me estimate a Three of a Kind hand:\n- Base Chips: 70\n- Plus cards in the three of a kind (let's say three 10s): 30 chips\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Total chips: ~204\n\n- Base Mult: 7\n- Jolly Joker: +8 Mult (since Three of a Kind contains a pair)\n\n\n- Smiley Face could add +5 per face card if I use face cards, and the Square Joker contributes +4 chips on exactly 4-card hands. This puts my multiplier around 15+, giving me roughly 3,060 chips per hand—well above what I need. Since I can't skip a Boss Blind, I'll play the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
