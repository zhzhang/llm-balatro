{"reasoning":"Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\nCurrent state:\n- I'm in a PLANET_PACK phase, meaning I need to select one of three planet cards to level up a hand type\n- I have $2 remaining\n- My jokers are focused on pairs (Jolly Joker, Scholar for aces, Smiley Face for face cards)\n\nBooster Pack Choices:\n1. Mercury - Level up Pair from Level 3 to Level 4 (+1 Mult and +15 chips)\n2. Pluto - Level up High Card from Level 1 to Level 2 (+1 Mult and +10 chips)\n3. Earth - Level up Full House from Level 1 to Level 2 (+2 Mult and +25 chips)\n\nCurrent Hand Levels:\n- Pair: Level 3, Base Chips 40, Base Mult 4, Times Played 5 (most played)\n- High Card: Level 1, Base Chips 5, Base Mult 1, Times Played 2\n- Full House: Level 1, Base Chips 40, Base Mult 4, Times Played 0\n\nAnalysis:\n- I've played Pair 5 times, making it my most-used hand\n- My joker setup strongly supports pair-based strategies (Jolly Joker gives +8 mult for pairs)\n- I need to beat upcoming blinds: Big Blind (3000 chips) and Boss Blind (4000 chips with Diamond debuff)\n\nLet me calculate the impact of each choice:\n\n**Mercury (Pair Level 3 → 4):**\n- Current Pair: 40 chips, 4 mult\n- After Mercury: 55 chips, 5 mult\n- This is a +15 chips and +1 mult improvement\n- Since I play pairs frequently and my jokers support this strategy, this is the most synergistic choice\n- Example calculation with my last pair of queens:\n  - Before: 40 + 20 (2 queens) + 104 (Blue Joker) = 164 chips × (4 + 8 Jolly + 10 Smiley) = 164 × 22 = 3,608 chips\n  - After: 55 + 20 + 104 = 179 chips × (5 + 8 + 10) = 179 × 23 = 4,117 chips\n  - This would be enough to beat the Boss Blind!\n\n**Pluto (High Card):** I've only played High Card twice, so this doesn't align with my current strategy. **Earth (Full House):** While it offers +2 mult, I haven't played Full House yet and would need to build a new strategy around it. Mercury is the clear choice since it maximizes my existing pair-focused approach and gives me the score needed to advance.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
