{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\nI'm in the PLANET_PACK phase, meaning I need to choose one planet card to upgrade a hand type. My options are:\n\n1. **Jupiter** - Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips)\n   - Current Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4\n   - After upgrade: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 6\n   - Times played: 1\n\n2. **Venus** - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult and +20 chips)\n   - Current Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5\n   - After upgrade: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7\n   - Times played: 2 (most played)\n\n3. **Mars** - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n   - Current Four of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 60, Base Mult 7\n   - After upgrade: Level 2, Base Chips 90, Base Mult 10\n   - Times played: 0 (never played)\n\nI need to think strategically about which hand type to upgrade:\n\n**Three of a Kind (Venus):**\n- Already Level 2, most played hand (2 times)\n- This is a hand I've been consistently able to make\n- Upgrading to Level 3 would give: 70 base chips, 7 base mult\n- This is reliable and I've proven I can make this hand\n\n**Flush (Jupiter):**\n- Level 1, only played once\n- Flushes require 5 cards of the same suit, which can be harder to achieve\n- Upgrading would give: 50 base chips, 6 base mult\n- Less reliable than Three of a Kind\n\n**Four of a Kind (Mars):**\n- Level 1, never played\n\n\n- Requires 4 cards of the same rank, which is extremely difficult to assemble\n- While the upgrade offers the biggest boost, I haven't managed to play this hand once yet\n- Too unreliable to invest in\n\nLooking at my track record, Three of a Kind stands out as the most consistent hand I can form. Venus is the clear choice since I've demonstrated I can reliably construct this hand and it's already progressed to Level 2.\n\nUpgrading to Level 3 would increase the payout from 50 chips and 5 mult to 70 chips and 7 mult—a solid gain of 20 chips and 2 mult on a hand type I know I can execute. Option 2 is the way to go.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
