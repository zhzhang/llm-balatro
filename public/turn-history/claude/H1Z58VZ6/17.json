{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round 2 (just completed Big Blind)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $9\n- Joker: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 1)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\nJokers:\n1. Mail-In Rebate - Earn $5 for each discarded 3, rank changes every round. Cost: $4\n2. Square Joker - Gains +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently 0 chips). Cost: $4\n\nBoosters:\n1.

Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently in the shop. Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance, I successfully beat the Big Blind with a massive flush (1,036 chips). The flush hand type was instrumental in this victory. I'm only on Ante 1/8, so the chip requirements are still relatively low.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Mail-In Rebate Joker ($4)**: This could provide passive income if I discard 3s. However, it's situational and relies on drawing 3s and choosing to discard them rather than play them. Not very reliable.\n\n2. **Square Joker ($4)**: Gains +4 chips per hand played with exactly 4 cards. This is a weak effect early on and doesn't synergize particularly well with my current strategy.\n\n\n3. **Celestial Packs ($4 each)**: Since flush just carried me to victory, upgrading hand types through Planet cards would directly strengthen my most effective plays. I could level up flush, straight, full house, or four of a kind depending on what's available.\n\n4. **Tarot Merchant Voucher ($10)**: Out of reach with my current $9.\n\n**Best Option:**\n\nThe Celestial Packs offer the most immediate value—investing in hands I've already proven effective with will compound my advantage going forward.\n\nWith $9, I can grab two packs for $8 and have $1 left over. But I should prioritize which hands deserve leveling most. Flush is the obvious choice since it just won me the round, though straight and the higher-value hands like full house and four of a kind are worth considering too. Pair, two pair, and three of a kind are more common but lower-impact. Since I'm still early (Ante 1/8), building my joker synergies matters—the Smiley Face joker I have benefits from face cards, so hands containing them gain extra value. I'll grab at least one Celestial Pack to start upgrading.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
