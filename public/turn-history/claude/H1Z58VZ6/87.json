{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the current blind select situation.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 10\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $7\n- Current Blind: Small, needs 11,000 chips, reward $3\n- Tag for skipping Small: Coupon Tag (free cards/boosters in next shop)\n- Upcoming Blind: Big, needs 16,500 chips, reward $4\n- Tag for skipping Big: Economy Tag (doubles money, max $40)\n- Upcoming Boss: needs 22,000 chips, reward $5, Boss effect: All Club cards are debuffed\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (currently)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n\n**Performance Analysis:**\nLooking at my recent hands:\n- Pair - 4,805 chips (with Fibonacci 3s)\n- Pair - 2,565 chips (with 9s)\n- Pair - 5,115 chips\n- Pair - 5,221 chips\n\nI've been consistently scoring 2,500-5,000+ chips per hand with pairs. The Small Blind needs 11,000 chips, which I should be able to beat with 2-3 good hands.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n\n1. **Can I beat the Small Blind?** \n   - Required: 11,000 chips\n   - My typical pair scoring: 2,500-5,000 chips\n   - I have 4 hands available per round (Grabber voucher)\n   - This seems very achievable\n   \n2. **Weighing the skip options:** The Coupon Tag would give me free shop items, but I'd forfeit the $3 reward and face the Big Blind unprepared. Alternatively, if I take the Small Blind's $3 and skip the Big Blind, I'd have $10 to double with the Economy Tag, reaching $20. Skipping Small outright leaves me with just $7 doubling to $14.\n\n3. **Boss Blind concerns:** The Boss debuffs all Clubs, which affects roughly a fifth of my deck. While debuffed cards won't generate chips or trigger abilities, they can still form hands with non-Club cards, so I'm not completely shut down.\n\nThe clearest path forward is playing through both blinds—taking the Small for $3 and the Big for $4 gives me practice and builds my cash position before facing the Boss. The free items from Coupon Tag aren't worth sacrificing momentum and preparation, and the Economy Tag's doubling effect works better when I've accumulated more capital through actual play.\n\nSince pairs have been my most reliable hand type, and I can construct them without relying on Clubs, I should proceed normally through all three blinds.","action":"\"play_round\""}
