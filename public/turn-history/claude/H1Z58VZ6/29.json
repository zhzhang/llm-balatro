{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Boss round)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $4\n- Owned Jokers: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per scored face card)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (can have 4 more)\n- No consumables\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Square Joker - Gains +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards - $4\n2. Ride the Bus - Gains +1 Mult per consecutive hand without scoring face card - $6 (can't afford)\n3. Mega Standard Pack - Choose 2 of 5 playing cards - $8 (can't afford)\n4. Telescope Voucher - Celestial Packs always contain Planet for most played poker hand - $10 (can't afford)\n5. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7 (most played - 2 times, just upgraded!)\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3 (2 times)\n- High Card: Level 1, Base Chips 5, Base Mult 1 (2 times)\n- Other hands mostly Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\nI only have $4, which means I can only afford:\n- Square Joker ($4)\n\nThe Square Joker would give +4 Chips whenever I play exactly 4 cards. This could be useful for consistency, but it doesn't synergize particularly well with my current Smiley Face joker which wants face cards.\n\nHowever, given I'm about to enter Ante 2 Round 3 (the Boss blind), I need to strengthen my deck. Having another joker is better than having nothing.\n\n\n---\n\nSpending my $4 on the Square Joker makes sense since it's my only option and I'm heading into a tougher blind. I can deliberately construct hands with exactly 4 cards to trigger the bonus. The main drawback is the weak synergy with Smiley Face, but adding any joker before the boss round is better than saving money I can't use elsewhere.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
