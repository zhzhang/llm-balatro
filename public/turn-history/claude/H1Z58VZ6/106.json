{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 12 - About to face Boss Blind\n- Money: $7\n- Just upgraded Three of a Kind to Level 5 (110 chips, 11 mult)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Showman ($5) - Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n- Wily Joker ($4) - +100 Chips if Three of a Kind\n- Arcana Pack ($4)\n- Director's Cut voucher ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - 16 plays\n- Three of a Kind: Level 5 (110 chips, 11 mult) - 5 plays\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI have $7 and am about to face the Boss Blind of Ante 5. Boss Blinds are significantly harder than regular blinds.\n\nLooking at my options:\n1. **Wily Joker ($4)** - This would add +100 chips to Three of a Kind hands. Since I just upgraded Three of a Kind to Level 5, this could be a strong combo. But I'm at max jokers (5/5), so I'd need to sell one first.\n\n2. **Showman ($5)** - This allows cards to appear multiple times in the shop. Could help me get more planet cards to level up Pair. \n\nI'd need to sell a joker first to make room. Considering which one to drop: Smiley Face hasn't contributed much since I'm not playing face cards regularly, and Blue Joker provides steady +104 chips but might be less impactful than Wily Joker's synergy with my Three of a Kind strategy.\n\n3. **Arcana Pack ($4)** - Tarot cards could modify my deck or jokers, though the outcome is uncertain.\n\n4. **Reroll ($5)** - Might reveal better options, but leaves me with only $2.\n\n5. **Save money and proceed** - Hold the $7 for the next shop after Boss Blind.\n\nLooking at my joker lineup, Blue Joker and Fibonacci both provide strong consistent bonuses, while Jolly Joker is core to my pair strategy. Scholar offers situational value with Aces. If I acquire Wily Joker, Three of a Kind would jump to around 314 chips with my current setup, but that hand only appears 5 times compared to Pairs at 16 plays, so the overall impact might be limited.\n\nI'm facing a Boss Blind soon, which typically demands 30,000-40,000 chips at this ante level. My recent pair hands have consistently scored 4,600-7,700 chips, while Three of a Kind peaked at 2,873. Adding Wily Joker could make Three of a Kind competitive—reaching 314 chips base, then multiplied by around 35x if I stack three Fibonacci cards together, which would be a significant power spike for that hand type.\n\nSmiley Face seems expendable since I'm not building around face cards anyway. Selling it for $2 gets me to $9, enough to purchase Wily Joker for $4 and still have $5 remaining. This trade strengthens my Three of a Kind while preserving my Pair backup strategy, so I'll move forward with this purchase.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
