{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $5\n\n**Current Blind: Small**\n- Chips Needed: 5000\n- Tag for skipping: Uncommon Tag (Free Uncommon Joker in shop)\n- Reward: $3\n\n**Upcoming Blind: Big**\n- Chips Needed: 7500\n- Tag for skipping: Top-up Tag (Create up to 2 Common Jokers if room available)\n- Reward: $4\n\n**Upcoming Blind: Boss**\n- Chips Needed: 10000\n- Boss Description: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\" (This appears to be The Plant boss - 7 cards are drawn face down, so I can't see what they are)\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6, Base Chips 85, Base Mult 7\n\n**Analysis of chip generation:**\n\nFor a pair of face cards:\n- Base chips: 85 (Level 6 pair)\n- Card chips: 10 + 10 = 20 (two face cards)\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Total chips: 85 + 20 + 104 = 209 chips\n\nFor mult:\n- Base mult: 7 (Level 6 pair)\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult (contains pair)\n\n\n- Smiley Face adds +10 mult from the two face cards, bringing total mult to 25\n\nThis gives 209 × 25 = 5,225 chips with face cards. If I play aces instead, I get 251 total chips from the base pair, card values, Scholar bonus, and Blue Joker, though the mult calculation differs since aces don't trigger Smiley Face.\n\nWith aces, the mult is 7 base plus 8 from Jolly Joker and 8 from Scholar's ace bonus, totaling 23 mult for 251 × 23 = 5,773 chips. Either hand comfortably clears the 5,000 chip Small Blind threshold.\n\nSkipping would grant an Uncommon Tag for a free Uncommon Joker worth roughly $6-8, but I'd forfeit the $3 reward and any money from subsequent hands. Playing guarantees the cash reward while keeping the run going.\n\nThe free joker is tempting since my slots are full—I'd need to sell something. Square Joker seems like the weakest fit for my pair-heavy strategy, making it the natural candidate to replace if I find a better Uncommon option.\n\nBut I should assess whether I actually need the upgrade. With my current setup generating 5,200-5,800 chips per pair, I can likely handle the Small and Big Blinds with 2-3 successful hands. The Boss Blind's face-down mechanic is trickier though—I won't be able to strategically choose which cards to play, so I'll need reliable, consistent scoring to get through it. The Uncommon Tag could give me that extra edge I need for the harder rounds ahead.\n\nLet me think through the skip mechanics more carefully. If I skip the Small Blind, I get the free Uncommon Joker but stay in the blind selection phase. I'd then immediately face the Big Blind decision without shopping first. I can only access the shop after I actually play a blind, not skip one. So the sequence would be: skip Small Blind → get Uncommon Tag → decide on Big Blind → play Big Blind → then shop. This means I'd need to beat the Big Blind before I could use any new cards from the shop.\n\nWith my current chip generation around 5,200-5,800 per pair, I should have enough to handle the 7,500 chip Big Blind. The trade-off is clear: I can either get a free Uncommon Joker by skipping and risking the Big Blind without shopping, or play the Small Blind for $3 and have the flexibility to shop before each subsequent blind. Given my consistent pair generation, the first path seems viable.\n\nI'm going to skip the Small Blind and go straight for the Uncommon Tag. The potential value of a free Uncommon Joker outweighs the safety of an extra $3 and a pre-Big Blind shop visit.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
