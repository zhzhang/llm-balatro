{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n4. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n5. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n6. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n7. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n8. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +78 Chips (constant)\n2. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if pair\n3. Scholar: Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n4. Fibonacci: Each played Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 gives +8 Mult when scored\n5. Wily Joker: +100 Chips if Three of a Kind\n\n**Game State:**\n- Chips needed: 22,000\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 5\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Boss Blind: All Club cards are debuffed\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n1. Pair of 4s (4 of Spades, 4 of Hearts)\n2. Pair of Kings (King of Spades, King of Diamonds)\n3. Flush (5 Spades): Ace, King, 10, 4, 3 of Spades\n\nLet me calculate the chip values for each option:\n\n**Option 1: Pair of 4s**\n- Base: 85 chips, 7 mult (Level 6 Pair)\n- Cards played: 4 of Spades (+4), 4 of Hearts (+4)\n- Blue Joker: +78 chips\n\n\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult\n- Total chips: 85 + 4 + 4 + 78 = 171 chips\n- Total mult: 7 + 8 = 15 mult\n- Final score: 171 × 15 = 2,565 chips\n\n**Option 2: Pair of Kings**\n- Base: 85 chips, 7 mult (Level 6 Pair)\n- Cards played: King of Spades (+10), King of Diamonds (+10)\n- Blue Joker: +78 chips\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult\n- Total chips: 85 + 10 + 10 + 78 = 183 chips\n- Total mult: 7 + 8 = 15 mult\n- Final score: 183 × 15 = 2,745 chips\n\nThe Kings pair generates slightly more chips due to higher card values, though both fall short of the 22,000 target. The Flush option with Fibonacci scoring could provide better multiplier scaling if I can trigger multiple Fibonacci cards.\n\n**Option 3: Flush (5 Spades)**\n- Base: 35 chips, 4 mult (Level 1 Flush)\n- Played cards: Ace (+11), King (+10), 10 (+10), 4 (+4), 3 (+3) = 38 chips\n- Blue Joker: +78 chips\n- Scholar (Ace): +20 chips, +4 mult\n- Fibonacci (Ace and 3): +16 mult (2 × 8)\n- Total chips: 35 + 38 + 78 + 20 = 171 chips\n- Total mult: 4 + 4 + 16 = 24 mult\n- Final score: 171 × 24 = 4,104 chips\n\nThe Flush significantly outperforms the other options with its 24x multiplier from Scholar and Fibonacci bonuses. Let me double-check: base flush gives 35 chips and 4 mult, the five cards add 38 chips, Blue Joker contributes 78 chips, Scholar triggers on the Ace for 20 chips and 4 mult, and Fibonacci activates on both the Ace and 3 for an additional 16 mult.\n\nI'll play positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Ace, King, 10, 4, 3 of Spades).","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
