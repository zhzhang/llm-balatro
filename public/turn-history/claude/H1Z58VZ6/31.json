{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Boss round)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $0\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card\n  2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently 0)\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind**: 800 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Tag for skipping: Top-up Tag (Create up to 2 Common Jokers - must have room)\n   \n2. **Big Blind**: 1200 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Tag for skipping: Coupon Tag (Initial cards and booster packs in next shop are free)\n   \n3. **Boss Blind**: 1600 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss Description: Start with 0 discards\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7 (most played)\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3\n- Other hands mostly Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my previous performance:\n- Three of a Kind scored 189 chips and 171 chips in Ante 1\n- Pair scored 585 chips and 60 chips in Ante 1\n- The higher pair score (585) was likely due to face cards triggering Smiley Face\n\nFor the Small Blind (800 chips):\n- With my Level 3 Three of a Kind (70 base chips, 7 base mult), I can potentially score:\n  - Base: 70 chips × 7 mult = 490 chips\n  - With face cards in the three of a kind + Smiley Face: Could add 3×5 = 15 mult\n  - Playing exactly 4 cards with Square Joker adds 4 chips\n  - Conservative estimate: ~70 chips × 12 mult = ~840 chips, which comfortably beats 800\n\nThe Small Blind appears achievable with my current hand strength. Regarding the skip option, the Top-up Tag would let me add up to 2 Common Jokers since I have 3 open slots. This could strengthen my deck significantly for future rounds, though I'd need to weigh whether the guaranteed jokers are worth more than the $3 reward and the chips I'd earn from playing.\n\nIf I skip, I'd get those free jokers but miss the shop and jump straight to the Big Blind at 1200 chips. Playing instead gives me money to spend and a chance to build momentum. The Big Blind skip reward—a Coupon Tag for free cards and boosters—is also compelling. I need to factor in the Boss Blind too, which starts with zero discards, making it particularly punishing.\n\nComparing the paths: skipping Small gets me 2 free jokers immediately, then I'd face Big Blind and potentially get the Coupon Tag. Playing Small lets me accumulate $3, shop, then continue building resources through Big Blind before hitting the Boss with limited options. The zero-discard Boss is the real constraint—I can't adapt my hand, so having strong jokers beforehand matters significantly.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
