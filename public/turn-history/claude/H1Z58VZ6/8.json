{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the booster pack choices and decide which joker to select.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (just finished Small Blind)\n- Money: $4\n- No jokers yet\n- Max Jokers: 5\n\nBooster Pack Choices:\n1. **Smiley Face** - Played face cards give +5 Mult when scored. Rarity: Common\n2. **Mail-In Rebate** - Earn $5 for each discarded King, rank changes every round. Rarity: Common\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Smiley Face:**\n- Gives +5 Mult for each face card (Jack, Queen, King) that's played and scored\n- This is a consistent, reliable joker that will help in most hands\n- Face cards appear frequently in a standard deck (12 out of 52 cards are face cards)\n- The +5 Mult per face card can add up quickly\n- If I play 2 face cards in a hand, that's +10 Mult\n- This scales well throughout the game\n\n**Mail-In Rebate:**\n- Earns $5 for each discarded King\n- The rank changes every round, so it won't always be Kings\n- This is primarily an economic joker, not a scoring joker\n- $5 per discarded card is good, but:\n  - I only have limited discards per round\n  - The rank changes, so I can't rely on it being Kings\n  - I need to actually draw and discard the specific rank\n  - It doesn't help me score chips to beat blinds\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent hands played:\n- Three of a Kind (9s) - 171 chips\n- Pair (Kings) - 60 chips\n- Two Pair - 108 chips\n\nI've been playing with face cards (Kings) and they're common in my deck. Smiley Face would have given me +5 Mult on the pair of Kings, boosting the score from 60 to 90 chips (30 base chips × 3 Mult instead of 2 Mult = 90).\n \nAt this stage, I need direct scoring power more than economy. Mail-In Rebate's reliance on drawing and discarding a specific rank makes it unreliable, and the changing rank each round means I can't build a strategy around it. Smiley Face, by contrast, works consistently with any hand containing face cards—which I'm already playing frequently. The Mult boost directly addresses the chip requirements that escalate through the antes, making it the stronger pick for progression.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
