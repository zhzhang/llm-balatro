{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase, choosing from 5 planet cards\n- I have $3 remaining after buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6\n- Next blind is Boss Blind requiring 4000 chips, with all Diamond cards debuffed\n- I'm at Ante 3/8, Round 7\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Available Planet Cards:**\n1. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips (currently Level 3: 70 chips, 7 mult)\n2. Uranus - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips (currently Level 1: 20 chips, 2 mult)\n3. Saturn - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips (currently Level 1: 30 chips, 4 mult)\n4. Jupiter - Level up Flush +2 Mult and +15 chips (currently Level 1: 35 chips, 4 mult)\n5. Mercury - Level up Pair +1 Mult and +15 chips (currently Level 4: 55 chips, 5 mult)\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 4 (55 chips, 5 mult) - Most played (6 times)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - Played 3 times\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - Played 2 times\n\n\n- Others are mostly Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nPair has been my most reliable hand, with my last pair scoring 3,703 chips—nearly enough for the Boss Blind's 4,000 requirement. Upgrading Mercury would push Pair to Level 5 (70 chips, 6 mult). A pair of face cards would then generate roughly 194 base chips from the hand itself, plus the Blue Joker's +104, Smiley Face multiplier from the face cards, and Jolly Joker's +8 mult bonus, which should comfortably exceed the threshold.\n\nThree of a Kind at Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult) offers higher base values—three face cards would give 224 chips before joker effects—but requires hitting the specific hand type, whereas Pair appears more achievable with my current setup.\n\nMercury is the safer pick since Pair is my most frequent hand and the mult increase from 5 to 6 combined with the chip boost reliably clears the 4,000 threshold.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
