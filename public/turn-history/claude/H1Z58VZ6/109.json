{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 12\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Boss Blind: \"All Club cards are debuffed\"\n- Chips needed: 22,000\n- Reward: $5\n- Current money: $5\n\n**Current Jokers (5/5):**\n1. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (constant)\n2. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n3. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace\n4. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n5. Wily Joker - +100 Chips if Three of a Kind\n\n**Key Information:**\n- Boss effect: All Club cards are debuffed\n- This means any Club cards I play will have their chip values disabled, BUT they will still participate in forming hands\n- My jokers will still work, and non-Club cards will still score normally\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - Most played (16 times)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 5 (110 chips, 11 mult) - 5 plays\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Pair hands: 4,619 to 7,761 chips\n- Three of a Kind: 2,873 chips (before Wily Joker)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith the Boss effect debuffing all Club cards, I need to be careful. Debuffed cards still form hands but don't contribute chip values or trigger effects. However, my joker effects (Blue Joker, Jolly Joker, Wily Joker) will still trigger as long as the hand type is formed.\n\nFor a Three of a Kind hand with Wily Joker:\n- Base: 110 chips, 11 mult\n\n\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Wily Joker: +100 chips if Three of a Kind\n- Total base: 314 chips, 11 mult\n- If I play three Fibonacci cards (Ace/2/3/5/8): +24 mult (3 × 8)\n- If those are Aces with Scholar: +60 chips and +12 mult\n- Potential: 374 chips × 47 mult = 17,578 chips\n\nFor a Pair hand, I'd get the base 85 chips and 7 mult, plus Blue Joker's +104 chips and Jolly Joker's +8 mult, but this falls short of the 22,000 chips needed.\n\nEven with optimal Fibonacci and Ace combinations across multiple hands, I'm barely approaching the threshold. Club cards won't help since they're debuffed. Since I can't avoid the Boss Blind, I'll need to play through and hope the hands align favorably.","action":"\"play_round\""}
