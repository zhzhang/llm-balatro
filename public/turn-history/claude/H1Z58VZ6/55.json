{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Phase: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $2\n- At the Big Blind with 3000 chips needed\n- Tag for skipping: Rare Tag (gives a free Rare Joker in shop)\n- Reward for playing: $4\n- Next blind is Boss Blind: 4000 chips needed, All Diamond cards debuffed\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 4, Base Chips 55, Base Mult 5 (most played - 5 times)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7 (played 3 times)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me calculate what I can score with my current setup:\n\nFor a pair of face cards (Kings/Queens/Jacks):\n- Base chips: 55\n- Cards: 10 + 10 = 20 chips\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Total chips: 55 + 20 + 104 = 179 chips\n\n- Base mult: 5\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult (for pair)\n- Smiley Face: +5 mult × 2 = +10 mult (for 2 face cards)\n- Total mult: 5 + 8 + 10 = 23 mult\n\nTotal score: 179 × 23 = 4,117 chips\n\n\nAces would give me more chips since they're worth 11 each, adding Scholar's bonuses for a total of 221 chips before multiplier. The multiplier drops slightly to 21 since Scholar only gives +4 per ace instead of Smiley Face's +5 per face card, resulting in 4,641 chips—a better option overall.\n\nMy previous pair at Small Blind scored 3,212 chips before the Pair upgrade to Level 4, so this new score represents solid progress. Now I need to decide whether to skip the Big Blind for a Rare Tag or play it for the $4 reward and shop access. The Rare Tag is tempting since it guarantees a free Rare Joker, but playing gives me money to spend in the shop before facing the Boss Blind with its Diamond debuff. d still beat it even with diamonds weakened.\n\nPlaying the Big Blind lets me earn $4 to reach $6 for shopping, which gives me more flexibility before facing the Boss. While the free Rare Joker is tempting—potentially DNA worth $8—I'd be locked into the Boss fight with only $2 and no shopping opportunity in between. Since I'm already at max jokers anyway, I'd need to sell something to use it. The safer path is progressing through the Big Blind, building my bankroll, then making informed purchases before the final challenge.","action":"\"play_round\""}
