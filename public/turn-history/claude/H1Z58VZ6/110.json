{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 13\n- Boss Blind: All Club cards are debuffed\n- Chips needed: 22,000\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 5\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $5\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n6. Ace of Clubs (debuffed - scores no chips, abilities disabled)\n7. 10 of Clubs (debuffed)\n8. 2 of Clubs (debuffed)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +88 Chips (constant)\n2. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if pair\n3. Scholar: +20 Chips and +4 Mult per Ace when scored\n4. Fibonacci: +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 when scored\n5. Wily Joker: +100 Chips if Three of a Kind\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe hand contains:\n- Pair of 4s (4 of Spades and 4 of Hearts)\n- Pair of 10s (10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs, but 10 of Clubs is debuffed)\n- Ace of Clubs (debuffed)\n- 2 of Clubs (debuffed)\n- King of Spades\n- 9 of Hearts\n\nThe best playable hand from the non-debuffed cards:\n- Pair of 4s (4 of Spades and 4 of Hearts)\n\n\n- Pair of 10s (10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs, but 10 of Clubs is debuffed)\n\nTo reach 22,000 chips across 5 hands, I need to discard the three Club cards since they're completely neutered by the Boss Blind. Removing them opens up fresh draws that won't be compromised. The deck still has roughly 44 cards left—about 10 Clubs remaining, 10 Spades, 11 Hearts, and 13 Diamonds—so I have decent odds of drawing useful non-Club cards.\n\nIf I play the pair of 4s with my current setup (Blue Joker providing +88 chips, Jolly Joker adding +8 mult to the pair), I'd score around 2,715 chips. That's nowhere near the 22,000 I need, so I have to find significantly stronger hands by cycling out the dead cards.\n\nDiscarding the three Clubs should help me draw better cards. With Wily Joker now active, a Three of a Kind becomes much more valuable—it would give me 110 base chips with 11 mult, plus the Blue Joker's +88 chips and Wily Joker's +100 chips bonus, totaling 298 chips before multipliers. If I can assemble three Fibonacci cards (like Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8), the scoring potential jumps significantly higher than my previous pair attempts.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [6,7,8]"}
