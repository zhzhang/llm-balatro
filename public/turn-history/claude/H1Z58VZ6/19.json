{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n- Joker: Smiley Face (played face cards give +5 Mult when scored)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 1)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Jokers:\n  1. Mail-In Rebate - Earn $5 for each discarded 3, rank changes every round. Cost: $4\n  2. Square Joker - Gains +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently 0 chips). Cost: $4\n- Boosters:\n  1. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards. Cost: $4\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently. Cost: $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels (after leveling Pair to Level 2):**\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3, Times Played 1\n- Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4, Times Played 1\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3, Times Played 2\n\n**Recent Performance:**\nI just beat the Big Blind with a massive 1,036 chip flush. I'm currently in the shop after buying one Celestial Pack and upgrading Pair to Level 2.\n\n**What should I do next?**\n\nI have $5 remaining. My options are:\n1. Buy Mail-In Rebate for $4 (have $1 left)\n2. Buy Square Joker for $4 (have $1 left)\n\n\n3. Buy another Celestial Pack for $4 (have $1 left)\n4. Reroll shop for $5 (have $0 left)\n5. Round select to move to next blind\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMail-In Rebate feels too unreliable since it depends on drawing and discarding specific ranks that rotate each round. Square Joker only triggers with exactly 4-card hands, which limits its usefulness and doesn't synergize well with my current setup. Another Celestial Pack could help level up more hand types, but I'm already getting good value from my first one. Rerolling might reveal better options, though I'd be left with no money afterward. I should probably just proceed to the next blind since my current hand is performing well. Buying the Celestial Pack for $4 would leave me with just $1 going into the boss blind, which is tight. However, leveling up Flush or another strong hand type could significantly improve my chances. Since I'm only on Ante 1, the boss blind shouldn't be too demanding yet. The risk is that the pack might contain planets for hands I don't need, but the potential payoff of upgrading a key hand makes it worth considering.\n\nMy current setup—Smiley Face joker, Level 2 Pair, and Level 1 Flush—should handle an early boss blind on its own. Still, I'll take the chance on the Celestial Pack and hope for a Flush upgrade or another valuable planet to make the blind easier.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
