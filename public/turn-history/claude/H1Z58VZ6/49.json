{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Phase: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $0\n- Jokers: 5/5 (at max capacity)\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind**: 2000 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Skip tag: Top-up Tag (Create up to 2 Common Jokers - but I'm at max capacity)\n   \n2. **Big Blind**: 3000 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip tag: Rare Tag (Shop has a free Rare Joker)\n   \n3. **Boss Blind**: 4000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss effect: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 3 (40 chips, 4 mult) - most played (4 times)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - played 3 times\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult)\n- Others at Level 1\n\n**Last played hands show I was scoring:**\n- Pair - 1,397 chips\n- Two Pair - 1,480 chips\n- Three of a Kind - 1,043 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me calculate my expected scoring with a pair of aces (since Scholar was just purchased):\n- Base: 40 chips, 4 mult\n\n\n- 2 Aces: 2 × 11 = 22 chips (assuming standard chip values)\n- Scholar bonus: 2 × 20 = 40 chips, 2 × 4 = 8 mult\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult\n- Total chips: 40 + 22 + 40 + 104 = 206 chips\n- Total mult: 4 + 8 + 8 = 20 mult\n- Final: 206 × 20 = 4,120 chips\n\nWith face cards in a pair, Smiley Face would add significant multiplier value on top of this baseline.\n\nFor three of a kind with aces, the Scholar bonus scales up considerably—60 chips from the bonus alone plus 33 from the aces themselves, combined with a higher base multiplier of 7 and the same joker contributions.\n\nMy scoring range of 3,000-5,000 chips per hand covers the Small Blind and Big Blind comfortably, with the Boss Blind achievable as long as I steer clear of diamond-heavy hands. Skipping the Small Blind would grant a Top-up Tag and up to 2 Common Jokers, but since I'm already at maximum joker capacity, this reward doesn't provide immediate value.\n\nPlaying the Small Blind makes more sense—I need just 2,000 chips, which my current setup handles easily, and the $3 payout will give me useful shop currency. My Scholar addition should push my scoring even higher than the 1,397 chips I managed before acquiring it.","action":"\"play_round\""}
