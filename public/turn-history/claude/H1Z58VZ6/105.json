{"reasoning":"Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\nCurrent state:\n- I'm in a PLANET_PACK selection phase after buying a Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6\n- I have $7 remaining\n- I'm at Ante 5/8, Round 12, about to face the Boss Blind next\n- My Pair hand is at Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) and has been played 16 times - this is my most reliable hand\n- Three of a Kind is at Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult) and has been played 5 times\n\nAvailable planet cards in the pack:\n1. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips (currently Level 4)\n2. Earth - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips (currently Level 1)\n3. Uranus - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips (currently Level 1)\n4. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips (currently Level 1)\n5. Saturn - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips (currently Level 1)\n\nMy jokers are optimized for:\n- Smiley Face: Face cards (+5 mult per face card)\n- Blue Joker: Constant +104 chips\n- Jolly Joker: Pairs (+8 mult)\n- Scholar: Aces (+20 chips and +4 mult per ace)\n- Fibonacci: Aces, 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s (+8 mult each)\n\nLooking at my play history, I've been heavily relying on Pairs (16 times played) and occasionally Three of a Kind (5 times played).\n\nThe problem is: there's NO PAIR OPTION in this planet pack! This is a significant issue since Pair is my primary strategy.\n\n\nVenus would boost my Three of a Kind from Level 4 to Level 5, gaining 20 chips and 2 mult—a reasonable upgrade for my second-most-played hand. Earth is intriguing since Full House combines both a three of a kind and a pair, potentially synergizing with my existing joker setup, though I've never played it before. The other options (Uranus, Mars, Saturn) target hands I rarely use, making them less immediately valuable. ily Joker in the shop at +100 chips for Three of a Kind, this could be a strong combo if I buy it later. Leveling it to 110 chips, 11 mult would be quite good.\n\nEarth (Full House) would benefit from Jolly Joker triggering for +8 mult since it contains both a three of a kind and pair, but I haven't successfully played this hand yet, suggesting my current deck doesn't support it well. Uranus (Two Pair) technically works with Jolly Joker, though the base stats are too weak to matter much even after leveling.\n\nVenus stands out as the best option—I've consistently formed it five times already, and pushing it further at Level 4 would create a reliable scoring engine with my joker synergies.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
