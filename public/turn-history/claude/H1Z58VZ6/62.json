{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Boss Blind: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n- Chips needed: 4000\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $3\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n3. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n4. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n5. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n7. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n8. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands (Currently 8 Chips)\n3. Blue Joker - +88 Chips (Note: decreased from +104, probably because we drew 8 cards from a 52-card deck)\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 5 (70 chips, 6 mult)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLooking at my current hand, I don't see any immediate pairs. Let me check:\n- King of Spades (1)\n- 4 of Spades (1)\n- 3 of Spades (1)\n- Ace of Hearts (1)\n- Jack of Hearts (1)\n- 2 of Hearts (1)\n- 9 of Clubs (1)\n\n\n- 8 of Clubs (1)\n\nNo pairs visible. My best strategy is to discard and search for a matching pair. Previous calculations showed a pair of face cards would yield around 4,656 chips and a pair of aces around 5,192 chips—both well above the 4000 threshold. With 4 discards remaining, I have reasonable odds of finding a pair. I need to decide which cards to discard to maximize my chances.\n\nI'll prioritize keeping the highest-value cards—King of Spades, Ace of Hearts, and Jack of Hearts—since these are most likely to form valuable pairs. The low cards (4, 3, 2, 9, 8) offer minimal value and should go. I'll discard the 4 of Spades, 3 of Spades, 2 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, and 8 of Clubs to give myself the best shot at drawing a matching card.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,6,7,8]"}
