{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $2\n- Max Jokers: 5/5 (at capacity)\n- Max Consumables: 0/2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. DNA (Rare) - $8 (can't afford)\n2. Lusty Joker - $5 (can't afford)\n3. Buffoon Pack - $4 (can't afford)\n4. Telescope Voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n5. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Upcoming Challenges:**\n- Big Blind: 3000 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 4000 chips needed, All Diamond cards are debuffed\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 4 (just upgraded), Base Chips 55, Base Mult 5\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 70, Base Mult 7\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $2, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop. My options are:\n1. Sell a joker to afford something\n2. Proceed to round select with $2 (which will give me interest)\n\nLet me think about what I need:\n- I just upgraded Pair to Level 4 (55 chips, 5 mult)\n- My last pair scored 3,212 chips, which beats the Big Blind (3000) but may fall short of Boss Blind (4000), especially with Diamond debuff\n\n\n- Playing a pair of face cards like Queens would give me: 55 base + 20 from the cards + 104 from Blue Joker, multiplied by 5 base + 8 from Jolly Joker + 10 from Smiley Face (2 face cards), which totals 179 × 23 = 4,117 chips—enough to clear the Boss Blind.\n\nWith Aces instead, Scholar adds 40 chips and 8 mult, pushing the total to 221 × 21 = 4,641 chips, which is even stronger. My current joker setup should handle the upcoming blinds comfortably. Now I'm considering whether selling Square Joker for $2 (giving me $4 total) would be worth it to purchase something else.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack could offer useful jokers, but I'm already at full capacity and my current synergies are performing well. Without reaching $5, I won't earn interest on my money anyway. I think holding my cash and progressing to the next round makes more sense—I'll have better shopping opportunities after the Big Blind when I've earned more chips.\n\nBut reconsidering: selling a weaker joker for $2-3 could let me grab the Buffoon Pack. Square Joker seems like the least valuable since it only triggers on 4-card hands that I rarely play, whereas Smiley Face boosts face pairs, Blue Joker provides solid chip value, Jolly Joker multiplies pairs, and Scholar scales with aces. I could sell Square Joker for $2 and reach $4 total, which is enough for the pack.\n\nThe issue is that the Buffoon Pack is unpredictable—I might pull something worse than what I'm dropping. Since my current joker lineup already handles the upcoming blinds well based on my scoring estimates, it makes more sense to move forward without gambling on a random replacement. I'll have better purchasing power after clearing the Big Blind anyway.","action":"\"round_select\""}
