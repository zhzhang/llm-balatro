{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8 (Round 9, about to face Boss Blind)\n- Money: $0\n- Game Step: SHOP\n\n**My Inventory:**\n- 5/5 Jokers (full)\n- 1/2 Consumables: Pluto (levels up High Card)\n- Voucher: Grabber (+1 hand per round)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- To Do List joker: $4 (can't afford)\n- Spectral Pack: $4 (can't afford)\n- Reroll: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card\n2. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (deck dependent)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult) - my main hand\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult) - just upgraded\n- Everything else at Level 1\n\n**Strategy:**\nI'm primarily playing Pairs with occasional Three of a Kind. My joker setup is optimized for this with multiple synergies around aces, face cards, and Fibonacci numbers.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\nI have $0 and cannot buy anything. My only remaining consumable is Pluto, which levels up High Card - a hand type I've only played twice and isn't part of my strategy.\n\nMy options are:\n1. Sell Pluto for $1 (but that doesn't help me buy anything since cheapest items cost $4)\n2. Use Pluto to level up High Card (but I don't use that hand)\n\n\n3. Just proceed to round select\n\nSince nothing in the shop is accessible and Pluto won't contribute to my current strategy, I'll move forward to face the Boss Blind. Winning the round will generate income through interest and hand payouts, giving me fresh capital for shopping afterward.","action":"\"round_select\""}
