{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $1\n- I just completed the Big Blind and am in the Shop phase\n- I have 5 jokers (max 5) - my joker slots are now full\n- No consumables (max 2)\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card (sells for $2)\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently +4 Chips) (sells for $2)\n3. Red Card - +3 Mult when booster pack skipped (currently +0 Mult) (sells for $2)\n4. Blue Joker - +2 Chips per remaining card in deck (currently +104 Chips) (sells for $2)\n5. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair (sells for $1)\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Gift Card (Uncommon) - Add $1 of sell value to every Joker and Consumable at end of round - Cost: $6\n2. Faceless Joker (Common) - Earn $5 if 3+ face cards discarded at the same time - Cost: $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - Cost: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for your most played poker hand - Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $1, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop:\n- Gift Card costs $6\n- Faceless Joker costs $4\n- Arcana Pack costs $4\n\n\n- Telescope costs $10\n- Reroll costs $5\n\nMy joker slots are completely full (5/5), so I can't acquire any more jokers without selling one first. Looking at what I have, the Smiley Face and Square Joker are too situational and rarely activate, while the Red Card has never triggered since I haven't been skipping booster packs. The Blue Joker is performing well with +104 chips, and the Jolly Joker provides solid mult when pairs appear. I need to consider which joker to sell if I want to make room for something better.\n\nEven if I sell the Red Card for $2, I'd only reach $3 total, which falls short of the $4 needed for either Faceless Joker or an Arcana Pack. Since I can't afford meaningful upgrades with my current resources, advancing to the next round makes the most sense.","action":"\"round_select\""}
