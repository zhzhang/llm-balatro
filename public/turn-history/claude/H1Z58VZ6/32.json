{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $0\n- I now have 4 jokers after skipping the Small Blind and receiving 2 free jokers:\n  1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card\n  2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently 0)\n  3. Red Card - +3 Mult when any Booster Pack is skipped (currently +0 Mult)\n  4. Blue Joker - +2 Chips for each remaining card in deck (currently +104 Chips)\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Big Blind**: 1200 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Tag for skipping: Coupon Tag (Initial cards and booster packs in next shop are free)\n   \n2. **Boss Blind**: 1600 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss Description: Start with 0 discards\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe key question is whether to play the Big Blind or skip it for the Coupon Tag.\n\n**If I play Big Blind:**\n- Need to score 1200 chips\n- Get $4 reward\n- Can shop normally before facing the Boss\n- Then face Boss Blind with 0 discards (1600 chips needed)\n\n**If I skip Big Blind:**\n- Get Coupon Tag: Initial cards and booster packs in next shop are free\n- Jump straight to Boss Blind with 0 discards (1600 chips needed)\n- No money earned\n\nLet me estimate my current scoring potential:\n\nWith Blue Joker adding +104 chips, my hands are significantly stronger. For a Level 3 Three of a Kind:\n- Base: 70 chips + 104 chips from Blue Joker = 174 chips\n\n\n- With face cards in the hand, Smiley Face could add up to +15 mult, and Square Joker adds +4 chips if I play exactly 4 cards\n- A three of a kind with three face cards would score around 174 chips × 22 mult = 3,916 chips\n- Even conservatively, I'm looking at 2,000+ chips per hand, which comfortably covers both the Big Blind and Boss Blind thresholds\n\nThe Boss Blind presents a real constraint since I have no discards available—I'm locked into whatever hand I draw. My joker suite needs to carry the weight without any hand manipulation. The Blue Joker's +104 chips is already substantial, and the other jokers provide solid multiplier support.\n\nPlaying Big Blind makes sense because I'll earn $4 to spend in the shop, potentially upgrading my deck with planet cards or consumables. The Coupon Tag would be nice for free shop items, but I already have four strong jokers working together, so additional cards might not be as critical. Building cash reserves now helps me scale for later antes.\n\nEven if the Boss forces me into weaker hands, the Blue Joker alone should generate enough chips to score well—a pair of face cards could easily push me past 2,000 chips.","action":"\"play_round\""}
