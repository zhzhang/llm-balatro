{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state and available hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Blind: Big Blind, need 1200 chips\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n3. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n4. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n5. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips, face card)\n6. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n7. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips, face card)\n8. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per scored face card\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (currently 0)\n3. Red Card - +3 Mult when booster pack skipped (currently +0 Mult)\n4. Blue Joker - +2 Chips for each remaining card in deck (currently +88 Chips)\n\n**Possible Hands in Current Hand:**\n- Pair of 10s (positions 1 and 6): 10 of Spades and 10 of Hearts\n- 5-card Spade flush: 10♠, 8♠, 6♠, 2♠, and need one more spade (don't have it)\n- Actually I have 4 spades: 10♠, 8♠, 6♠, 2♠ - that's only 4 cards, not enough for a flush\n\nLet me think about the best hand to play:\n\n\nPlaying the pair of 10s gives me 25 base chips plus 3 mult, with the Blue Joker adding 88 chips from remaining deck cards. That's 133 × 3 = 399 total—nowhere near the 1200 needed. I need to explore other combinations that might leverage the Smiley Face joker's multiplier bonus from face cards.\n\nIf I include the Queen and Jack alongside the pair of 10s, I get the same 133 chips since only cards in the scoring hand contribute their chip values. The key question is whether the Smiley Face joker multiplies the score when face cards are played, even if they're not part of the pair itself.\n\nLooking at the rules more carefully: cards that don't participate in the hand don't trigger effects. Since the Queen and Jack wouldn't be part of the pair, they wouldn't score and therefore wouldn't activate Smiley Face's bonus. The multiplier only applies to face cards that actually score as part of the hand.\n\nBut that 585-chip result suggests something else is happening. Let me reconsider whether non-participating cards might still trigger \"on scored\" effects differently than \"when played\" effects, or if there's another mechanic at play here that's boosting the score significantly.\n\nFor the immediate decision, I should focus on the clearest option: playing exactly 4 cards with the pair of 10s and two other cards would trigger Square Joker for a permanent +4 chips boost, giving me 137 base chips with 3x multiplier.\n\nBut 411 total isn't sufficient. I need to explore alternative strategies rather than stick with this approach. Looking at my hand composition—4 spades, a pair of 10s, and 2 face cards—I could potentially pursue a flush instead. With 44 cards left in the deck and 9 remaining spades, drawing 5 new cards gives me a reasonable shot at completing a 5-card spade hand. The flush would likely generate better scoring than my current options. Base mult: 4\n- Total: 155 × 4 = 620 chips\n\nThat's still short of 1200. I need to reconsider the Blue Joker calculation. After discarding 4 cards and drawing 4 new ones, the deck shrinks to 40 cards, so the Blue Joker would give +80 chips instead of +88. Let me recalculate with this adjustment and see if the flush strategy actually gets me closer to my target. the best chance at 1200 chips across my 4 remaining hands. Let me discard strategically to improve what I'm working with.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,8]"}
