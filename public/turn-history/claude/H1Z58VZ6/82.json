{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 10\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Boss (The Serpent - 7 cards drawn face down)\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 5\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Money: $0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: King of Spades (+10 chips) - face card\n2: Queen of Spades (+10 chips) - face card\n3: 2 of Spades (+2 chips) - Fibonacci number\n4: 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5: 5 of Hearts (+5 chips) - Fibonacci number\n6: 3 of Hearts (+3 chips) - Fibonacci number\n7: 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n8: 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips) - Fibonacci number\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +76 Chips (currently)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 6 (85 chips, 7 mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult)\n\n**Possible Hands I Can Make:**\n\n1. **Two Pair (9s and 2s)**: positions 4, 7, 3, 8\n   - Base: 20 chips, 2 mult\n   - Cards: 9+9+2+2 = 22 chips\n   - Blue Joker adds 76 chips for 118 total, then both 2s trigger Fibonacci for +16 mult, giving 18 mult overall and 2,124 chips final.\n\n2. **Pair of 9s**: positions 4, 7\n   - Base: 85 chips, 7 mult\n   - Cards: 9+9 = 18 chips\n   - Blue Joker contributes 76 chips for 179 total chips\n   - Jolly Joker grants +8 mult, bringing mult to 15\n   - Score: 179 × 15 = 2,685 chips\n\n3. **Pair of 2s**: positions 3, 8\n   - Base: 85 chips, 7 mult\n   - Cards: 2+2 = 4 chips\n   - Blue Joker: +76 chips (165 total)\n   - Jolly Joker: +8 mult\n   - Fibonacci bonus on both 2s: +16 mult\n   - Final mult: 31\n   - Score: 165 × 31 = 5,115 chips\n\nThe pair of 2s wins out because of the Fibonacci synergy triggering twice. Verifying: base chips of 85 plus the card values and Blue Joker reach 165, while the multiplier stacks from the base 7, Jolly Joker's +8, and two separate Fibonacci bonuses of +8 each for a total of 31.\n\nThis gives me 5,115 chips this hand, leaving about 5,000 more needed to hit 10,000 across my remaining plays. I'll go with the pair of 2s.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,8]"}
