{"reasoning":"Looking at the current game state, I'm in the SHOP phase after beating the Big Blind in Ante 4. Let me analyze what I have and what's available:\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- Money: $12\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2 (empty)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Square Joker - +8 Chips for 4-card hands\n3. Blue Joker - +104 Chips (2 per remaining card in deck)\n4. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n5. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Fibonacci (FREE - Uncommon Tag) - +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n2. To Do List ($4) - Earn $4 if poker hand is Full House\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - $4\n2. Arcana Pack - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Grabber - $10 - Permanently gain +1 hand per round\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at Ante 4/8, halfway through the game. Looking at my recent hands, I've been playing mostly pairs, with one three of a kind. My joker setup is heavily optimized for pairs:\n- Jolly Joker gives +8 mult for pairs\n- Scholar gives bonuses for aces\n- Smiley Face gives bonuses for face cards\n- Blue Joker gives flat chips\n- Square Joker is somewhat situational\n\nThe FREE Fibonacci joker is interesting because:\n- It gives +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n- This synergizes with my Scholar joker (which also benefits aces)\n\n\n- Pairing any of those card values would stack the multiplier nicely\n\nSince my joker slots are full, I need to decide what to replace. Square Joker seems weakest—it only triggers on exactly 4-card hands, which I rarely play. Smiley Face is more reliable since I frequently score face card pairs.\n\nSwapping Square Joker for Fibonacci would significantly boost my ace pairs, especially combined with Scholar's bonuses. The Grabber voucher is also compelling, offering a permanent hand increase for just $10.\n\nMy strategy: sell Square Joker for $2 to reach $14, grab Fibonacci free with my Uncommon Tag, then purchase Grabber for $10. That leaves me with $4 and strengthens both my joker synergies and round flexibility. I'm also noticing To Do List could generate $4 per Full House, which becomes more viable if I have extra hands to work with.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
