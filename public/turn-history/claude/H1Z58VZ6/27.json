{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Boss round coming up)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $8\n- Owned Jokers: Smiley Face (gives +5 Mult per scored face card)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (can have 4 more)\n- No consumables\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Square Joker - Gains +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (Currently 0 Chips) - $4\n2. Ride the Bus - Gains +1 Mult per consecutive hand without scoring face card (Currently +0 Mult) - $6\n3. Mega Standard Pack - Choose 2 of 5 playing cards - $8\n4. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards - $4\n5. Telescope Voucher - Celestial Packs always contain Planet for most played poker hand - $10\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $5\n\n**Analysis of Hands:**\nLooking at my hand history:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, played 2 times (most played)\n- Pair: Level 2, played 2 times (tied for most played)\n- High Card: Level 1, played 2 times (tied for most played)\n- Flush: Level 1, played 1 time\n- Two Pair: Level 1, played 1 time\n\nMy most played hand types are Three of a Kind, Pair, and High Card (all at 2 plays).\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n\n1. **Square Joker ($4)**: This synergizes with playing exactly 4 cards. Not great synergy with Smiley Face which wants face cards. Could be decent for consistency but not amazing.\n\n2. **Ride the Bus ($6)**: This is anti-synergy with Smiley Face! Smiley Face wants face cards, but Ride the Bus wants NO face cards. \n\nRide the Bus directly conflicts with my current Joker strategy, so I should skip it.\n\n3. **Celestial Pack ($4)**: This would level up one of my poker hands. Since Three of a Kind and Pair are tied for most played, I'd likely see one of those in the pack. Leveling up Three of a Kind (currently at Level 2: 50 chips, 5 mult) would be useful. Or I could level up other hands.\n\n4. **Mega Standard Pack ($8)**: This would add 2 new playing cards to my deck. Could be good for getting more face cards to synergize with Smiley Face.\n\n5. **Telescope Voucher ($10)**: Too expensive right now (I only have $8).\n\n6. **Reroll ($5)**: Could get better jokers or shop options.\n\nWith $8 available, I'm weighing whether to grab the Square Joker and Celestial Pack combo, invest everything in the Mega Standard Pack for more face cards, or reroll hoping for stronger options. Ante 2 is coming up with tougher blinds, so I need to decide between strengthening my existing synergies with Smiley Face or leveling up my most-played hands.\n\nThe Mega Standard Pack is tempting since picking 2 face cards out of 5 would give me more triggers for Smiley Face's bonus, but the Celestial Pack's immediate hand-level boost might be more reliable for scaling into harder rounds.\n\nI'll go with the Celestial Pack for $4. Leveling up my most-played hands now will pay dividends as the antes get tougher, and I'll still have resources for future shops.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
