{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the TAROT_PACK phase, choosing 1 of 3 Tarot cards from an Arcana Pack\n- Money: $0\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 9\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. **The High Priestess** - Creates up to 2 random Planet cards (Must have room)\n2. **The Devil** - Enhances 1 selected card into a Gold Card (Gold Cards give $3 when held in hand at end of round)\n3. **The World** - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Spades\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades\n2. 2 of Spades\n3. 9 of Hearts\n4. 7 of Clubs\n5. Queen of Diamonds\n6. 5 of Diamonds\n7. 3 of Diamonds\n8. 2 of Diamonds\n\n**My Joker Setup:**\n1. Smiley Face - +5 Mult per face card scored\n2. Blue Joker - +88 Chips (depends on deck size)\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if hand contains pair\n4. Scholar - +20 Chips and +4 Mult per ace scored\n5. Fibonacci - +8 Mult for each Ace, 2, 3, 5, or 8 played\n\n**My Strategy:**\n- Primarily playing Pairs (Level 6, most played)\n- Focus on aces (Scholar + Fibonacci synergy)\n- Face cards (Smiley Face synergy)\n- Fibonacci also benefits from 2s, 3s, 5s, and 8s\n\n**Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n1. **The High Priestess** - Creates up to 2 Planet cards\n   - I have 2 consumable slots available\n   - Planet cards level up hand types, and since Pairs are already maxed at Level 6, I could strengthen secondary hands or push Pairs even further. This offers solid utility for scaling.\n\n2. **The Devil** - Gold Card enhancement\n   - Provides $3 per Gold Card held at round end, which would help rebuild my bankroll from $0. However, this is purely economic and doesn't amplify my scoring mechanics or synergize with my Joker setup.\n\n3. **The World** - Converts up to 3 cards to Spades\n   - This would let me convert non-Spade cards in my hand to match my Spade-heavy strategy, potentially improving hand consistency and scoring potential.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe High Priestess is the strongest pick here. Getting 2 Planet cards lets me either push Pair beyond Level 6 or develop backup hands like Three of a Kind and Two Pair for flexibility when I can't form pairs. The Devil only addresses cash flow without improving my actual scoring power, and The World doesn't align with my pair-focused strategy since I'm not building flush-based hands.\n\nI'll go with The High Priestess.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
