{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10 (just beat Big Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $7\n- Next blind will be Boss Blind (since we just beat Big)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\nMy build is clearly optimized for Three of a Kind hands. I just scored 14,175 chips on the Big Blind with a Three of a Kind.\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Uranus (Planet) - Levels up Two Pair (+1 Mult, +20 chips) - $3\n2. Walkie Talkie (Joker) - Each played 10 or 4 gives +10 Chips and +4 Mult - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack (Tarot) - $4\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarots appear 2X more frequently - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $7. The Boss Blind is coming up and will have significantly higher chip requirements than the 7,500 I just beat.\n\nLet me think about what would help:\n1. Uranus ($3) - Not useful, I don't play Two Pair\n2. Walkie Talkie ($4) - This could add some chip/mult but doesn't synergize well with my Three of a Kind strategy\n\n\n3. Arcana Pack ($4) - Could get useful tarots for enhancing cards or affecting jokers\n4. Jumbo Standard Pack ($6) - Could get enhanced cards to add to deck\n5. Reroll ($5) - Look for better options\n\nGiven my strategy is Three of a Kind focused, I should look for:\n- Planet cards that level up Three of a Kind\n- Jokers that synergize with Three of a Kind\n- Ways to enhance my cards (Bonus, Mult, etc.)\n\nThe Arcana Pack could give me tarots to enhance cards which would be useful. With only $7, I can't afford both the Arcana Pack and anything else substantial, so I need to decide if a reroll might reveal better options or if I should commit to one of these purchases.\n\nWait—the Telescope voucher guarantees a Three of a Kind planet card in any Celestial Pack I buy, since that's my most-played hand. I don't see one available now, but rerolling for $5 would leave me with $2 afterward. That's worth trying to find either a Celestial Pack or stronger jokers that complement my current strategy.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
