{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $5\n- Jokers: Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind), Sock and Buskin (Retrigger all played face cards)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. The Lovers (Tarot) - $3 - Enhances 1 card into Wild Card\n2. Jumbo Buffoon Pack (Booster) - $6 - Choose 1 of 4 Joker cards (can't afford)\n3. Jumbo Celestial Pack (Booster) - $6 - Choose 1 of 5 Planet cards (can't afford)\n4. Hieroglyph (Voucher) - $10 - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round (can't afford)\n5. Reroll: $5 (exactly what I have)\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Full House scored 1,344 chips (crushed the 450 requirement)\n- Playing Three of a Kind and Full House hands successfully\n- Just bought Sock and Buskin which retriggers face cards\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith only $5, I have limited options:\n1. Buy The Lovers for $3 (leaves me with $2)\n2. Reroll the shop for $5 (leaves me with $0)\n3. Move to round select and save the money\n\nLet me think about what's most valuable:\n\n**The Lovers ($3):**\n- Turns one card into a Wild Card (can be used as any suit)\n- This could help me make flushes or other suit-based hands\n- However, I'm currently focused on rank-based hands (Three of a Kind, Full House)\n- Wild cards don't change ranks, only suits\n- With my current strategy, this seems less impactful\n\n\n- Spending $3 leaves me with $2, which isn't enough for much else\n\nRerolling would cost everything I have, and while I might find better jokers or cheaper items, I'm already performing well with my current setup. Holding onto the $5 for future rounds seems smarter—the boss blind is coming up, and having resources available later could be crucial. My two jokers are working well together, and I should focus on preserving capital at this early stage. A Wild Card from The Lovers could preserve a face card's rank while adding suit flexibility—so a Wild King would still retrigger with Sock and Buskin while helping complete flushes. However, my current Three of a Kind and Full House strategy doesn't rely on suits, so the added flexibility doesn't meaningfully improve my position. The risk of spending money on a card that doesn't directly support my existing approach outweighs the potential benefit.\n\nI'll pass on the enhancement and hold onto my funds for a more impactful upgrade down the line.","action":"\"round_select\""}
