{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10\n- In SELECTING_HAND phase (Big Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 7,500\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Money: $0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n2. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n3. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, WITH POLYCHROME (X1.5 Mult)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade card\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (with 6 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult if Three of a Kind\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Hierophant - Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at the current hand:\n- Pair of 6s (6 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs)\n- Face cards: Queen of Clubs, Jack of Clubs\n- Other: 8 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, 3 of Clubs\n\nThe best hand I can make right now is just a pair of 6s. However, my strategy is built around Three of a Kind hands to maximize my joker synergies.\n\n\nI need to discard strategically to chase a Three of a Kind. With 4 discards available, I should target the 6s since there are 3 remaining in the deck—that gives me a solid chance to complete the set. The other options are less promising: Queens, Jacks, 8s, and Aces are all available but don't align as well with my current hand structure.\n\nMy best move is to hold onto the pair of 6s and dump the unmatched cards—the 8 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, and 3 of Clubs. This maximizes my odds of drawing into trips while clearing out the dead weight.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,7]"}
