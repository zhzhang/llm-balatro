{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n3. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips, Wild Card - can be used as any suit)\n4. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips, Gold Card - gives $3 at end of round, creates Planet card)\n5. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n6. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n7. Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank or suit)\n\n**Goal:** Need 11,000 chips to beat the Small Blind\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (3 per joker × 6 jokers)\n4. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n5. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of 8s (8 of Spades + 8 of Diamonds)\n- High Card\n\nI don't have a Three of a Kind in my current hand, which is my strongest hand type. I should discard and try to get better cards to form a Three of a Kind.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining. I could:\n1. Discard now to try to get a better hand (Three of a Kind ideally)\n2. Play a weak hand now and save stronger hands for later\n\nGiven that I need 11,000 chips total and I have 4 hands, I should aim to get around 2,750 chips per hand on average. \n\nMy Three of a Kind setup can generate significantly more than that average. I should strategically discard to build toward it—keeping the 2 of Clubs for its end-of-round value and the face cards since Sock and Buskin retrigggers them, while discarding lower cards that don't contribute to forming a triple.\n\nLooking at my remaining deck, the 6s and Aces appear most frequently (5 each), followed by Kings, 10s, 5s, and 7s (4 each). I should focus on discarding ranks where I'm unlikely to draw a third copy, prioritizing cards from ranks that appear less frequently or don't synergize with my current hand.\n\nThe 8s are a clear discard since both are in my hand with none left in the deck—impossible to complete. The 9 of Diamonds is risky with only 2 remaining copies. I'll hold onto the Jack and Queen since they have better odds, and the 2 of Clubs stays for its passive benefits. The Stone Card is also worth reconsidering since it provides +50 chips, which could be valuable depending on my scoring strategy.\n\nMy best move is to discard the two 8s, the 9 of Diamonds, and the Stone Card, then draw 4 new cards. This preserves the Queen of Hearts as my Wild Card and keeps the 2 of Clubs for its Gold Card advantage while maximizing my chances at completing a Three of a Kind with the remaining cards.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,6,7]"}
