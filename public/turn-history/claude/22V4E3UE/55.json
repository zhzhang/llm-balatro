Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\\n2. King of Spades (Steel Card - +10 chips, X1.5 Mult while in hand)\\n3. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\\n4. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\\n5. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\\n6. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\\n\\n**My Jokers:**\\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\\n\\n**Analysis of Current Hand:**\\n\\nI have:\\n- Pair of Aces (Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds)\\n- Pair of Kings (King of Spades Steel Card, King of Diamonds)\\n- 10 of Spades\\n- 3 of Spades\\n- 4 of Clubs\\n- 7 of Diamonds\\n\\nBest hands I can make:\\n1. **Two Pair** (Aces and Kings)\\n2. **Flush** (I have 4 spades: Ace, King, 10, 3)\\n\\nLet me calculate the best option:\\n\\n**Option 1: Flush with 4 spades (need 5 for flush, so this won't work)**\\n\\n\\n**Option 2: Two Pair (Aces and Kings)**\\n\\nTo form two pair, I need to play both the Aces and Kings together. If I play Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds, King of Diamonds, and a fourth card, I get a pair of Aces worth 32 chips base. But I should consider whether playing both pairs gives me better value with my Jokers, particularly Sock and Buskin which retriggers face cards and Wrathful Joker which rewards spades.\\n\\n**Option 3: Playing all four face cards**\\n\\nIf I commit both Kings and both Aces to Two Pair, I sacrifice the Steel King's X1.5 multiplier. The hand scores 62 chips base (20 for two pair plus the card values), and with Wrathful Joker adding +3 per spade, Abstract Joker's +15 mult, and Sock and Buskin retriggering all four face cards, the multiplier compounds significantly. I need to weigh whether this setup outperforms keeping the Steel King held for its multiplier bonus. 3, King of Spades +3, and they each score twice, so +12 total. Mult comes to 2 (base) + 12 (wrathful) + 15 (abstract) = 29 mult, giving me 104 \\u00d7 29 = 3,016 chips.\\n\\nThat exceeds 3000, but I should double-check this. Actually, Steel King requires staying in hand to get the X1.5 mult bonus\\u2014if I play it, that multiplier disappears. So I need to reconsider whether keeping it unplayed while using the other cards for Three of a Kind might work better.\\n\\nWith 4 spades, I can't make a Flush, so I'm weighing whether Steel King's X1.5 mult in hand outweighs playing it as part of a stronger combination. If I keep it and play a pair of Aces instead, I get 32 chips from the pair, base mult of 2, plus the Wrathful and Abstract bonuses, with Sock and Buskin retriggering the Aces for additional scoring.\\n\\nThat gives me 54 chips \\u00d7 30 mult = 1,620 total, which falls short. Let me evaluate the Two Pair hand more carefully by playing all four cards\\u2014both Aces and both Kings. The base is 20 chips, and scoring left to right: Ace of Spades adds 11 chips and triggers Wrathful for +3 mult, then gets retriggered by Sock and Buskin. King of Spades contributes 10 chips with another Wrathful trigger and retrigger. Ace of Diamonds adds 11 chips with a retrigger, followed by King of Diamonds.\\n\\nThe second King adds 10 chips with a retrigger, bringing total chips to 104. Multiplier comes to 29 from the base 2, plus 12 from Wrathful activations across both spades cards, plus 15 from Abstract. That's 104 \\u00d7 29 = 3,016 chips, which works. I'll go with positions 1, 2, 6, 7 for the Two Pair.\\nCommand: play 1 2 6 7 two pair 3016\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 54]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 7\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

High card if I play single cards\\n\\nLet me calculate the pair of 9s:\\n- Base chips: 10\\n- Played cards: 9 of Hearts (+9) + 9 of Clubs (+9) = 10 + 9 + 9 = 28 chips\\n\\n\\n- Base mult: 2\\n- Abstract Joker: +15 mult\\n- Total mult: 2 + 15 = 17 mult\\n- Total chips: 28 \\u00d7 17 = 476 chips\\n\\nThis falls short of the 868 chips I need. With 2 discards and 3 hands remaining, I should consider what draws could help. The deck has 3 Aces, 3 8s, 4 Queens, 4 Jacks, 2 Kings, and only 1 more 9 available. If I could draw a third 9, I'd trigger Zany Joker and get 57 chips \\u00d7 30 mult = 1,710 chips\\u2014well above my target. However, that's just a 1/30 chance per draw. I should also explore other three-of-a-kind possibilities with the remaining cards.\\n\\nFor my discard strategy, I can only remove 5 cards at a time, so I need to be selective. I'll hold onto both 9s and consider which other cards to keep. The 10 of Spades could be valuable for Wrathful Joker if I build around spades.\\n\\nLooking at the remaining hands and discards available, I should focus on maximizing my chances of hitting a third 9 or assembling another matching set. Keeping just the pair of 9s and discarding the rest gives me the best odds of drawing into something useful\\u2014either another 9 for three of a kind, or face cards that synergize with Sock and Buskin.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 55]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 7\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

Let me think about what multipliers I can stack. The Abstract Joker gives +15 mult, and I have other multiplier sources available. Maybe I should focus on maximizing the multiplier rather than just the chip count. need 868 chips. This isn't working.\\n\\nI should consider discarding to draw a third 9 or find other matching cards. Looking at what's left in the deck: only one more 9, but there are multiple Aces, 8s, Queens, Jacks, and Kings available. A third 9 would give me three of a kind, triggering Zany Joker for an additional 12 mult. With three 9s, I'd have 57 base chips from the hand plus the multiplier boost from Zany Joker.\\n\\nWith Zany Joker's +12 mult and Abstract Joker's +15, my total multiplier would reach 30, giving me 57 \\u00d7 30 = 1,710 chips\\u2014well above what I need. The problem is I only have one discard left and 25 cards in the deck, so the odds of hitting that third 9 are slim. Three face cards of the same rank could work too\\u2014I have one Jack and one Queen, with three more of each in the deck. I need to decide whether to risk my last discard trying for a matching set or preserve my pair of 9s. then gets retriggered for another +3 mult. The Queen of Diamonds doesn't contribute additional multiplier despite retriggering. Both 9s add 9 chips each for a pair total of 28 chips. With base multiplier of 2, Wrathful's +6, and Abstract's +15, I reach 23 mult\\u2014giving 644 total. That's still insufficient, so I need to discard these cards and search for a stronger hand.\\nCommand: discard 2 4 6 7\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 7\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Current Blind: Big (3000 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 2132\n- Chips still needed: 3000 - 2132 = 868\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 0 (no more discards!)\n- Current Money: $11\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n6. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n8. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards (cosmetic here)\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have an excellent hand now! I have:\n- THREE 9s! (9 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs) - This is a Three of a Kind!\n- Two Kings (King of Hearts, King of Clubs)\n- Two Queens (Queen of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds)\n- One Jack (Jack of Spades)\n\nThe best hand I can make is **Three of a Kind with the three 9s**!\n\nLet me calculate the chips for playing three of a kind with all three 9s:\n\n**Three of a Kind (9 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs):**\n\n\nBase chips: 30 + 27 from the three 9s = 57 chips total.\n\nFor multipliers, the three 9s trigger Zany Joker's +12 mult bonus. The 9 of Spades adds +3 mult from Wrathful Joker, and Abstract Joker provides a constant +15 mult. This gives me a solid multiplier to work with for reaching the 868 chip gap. careful about which cards actually contribute to the hand value. Only cards that are part of the highest hand rank add their chip values—the Jack wouldn't count toward the Three of a Kind, so it contributes no chips. However, it would still trigger the Wrathful Joker's +3 mult for being a spade and activate Sock and Buskin's retrigger since it's a face card. Recalculating with the Jack included: the base chips remain 57 (from the three 9s), the base mult is 3, and I need to factor in the Zany Joker's contribution.\n\nThe Wrathful Joker gives +3 for the 9 of Spades, then +3 again for the Jack of Spades, and the retrigger adds another +3, totaling +9 mult. Combined with the Zany Joker's +12 and Abstract Joker's +15, the total multiplier reaches 39, giving 57 × 39 = 2,223 chips. Adding more face cards like the Queen of Hearts would trigger additional retriggering effects, though I need to verify whether those actually increase the multiplier or just cycle through the same jokers without adding new mult values. the Queen doesn't contribute mult since it's not a spade, and while it retriggered, that doesn't generate additional mult without a specific joker effect. So I'll stick with the three 9s and Jack of Spades.\n\nLet me verify the final calculation with positions 1, 2, 5, 7. The hand type is Three of a Kind, giving 30 base chips. Only the spades contribute to the chip count, and I need to recalculate the total mult carefully to ensure I have the right answer. The final score comes to 2,223 chips, which should be sufficient to win the round."
