{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n4. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n5. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n7. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Goal:** Need 800 chips to pass the Small Blind.\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker: Played cards with Spade suit give +3 Mult when scored\n4. Business Card: Played face cards have a 1 in 2 chance to give $2 when scored\n\n**Possible Hands in Current Hand:**\n- Three face cards: Jack of Spades, Queen of Hearts, King of Diamonds - but they're all different ranks, so no Three of a Kind\n- Pair of 6s: 6 of Hearts and 6 of Diamonds\n- Diamond flush potential: King, 8, 7, 6 of Diamonds (4 cards, need 5 for flush)\n- No obvious Three of a Kind\n\nLet me check what hands I can make:\n- High Card: Just play the best cards\n- Pair: 6 of Hearts and 6 of Diamonds\n- No Three of a Kind visible\n- No straights\n- No flush (only 4 diamonds)\n\n**Best Current Option:**\nThe pair of 6s is the best I can make right now. Let me calculate the chips:\n\nPair (6s):\n- Base: 10 chips + 2 mult\n\n\n- Each 6: +6 chips = 12 chips total from the pair\n- Total chips: 22 chips × 2 mult = 44 chips\n\nThat's nowhere near 800 chips. I need to discard and try to draw into a better hand, ideally a Three of a Kind with face cards. I should keep the face cards since they work well with Sock and Buskin, and discard the lower value cards like the 3 of Clubs.\n\nWait, I need to think about this more carefully. With 4 discards available, I should consider what's actually left in the deck. There are still 3 Kings, 3 Queens, and 3 Jacks remaining—I already have one of each. If I can draw into trips of any face card, especially the Jack of Spades, that would give me a much stronger hand. The 6s I'm holding are only worth 12 chips even as a pair, so they're not worth protecting.\n\nI'll discard the low cards and the pair of 6s to maximize my chances of hitting trips on the face cards. Keeping the Jack of Spades, Queen of Hearts, and King of Diamonds means I have three separate opportunities to improve, with the Jack being particularly valuable since it synergizes with Wrathful Joker.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,6,7,8]"}
