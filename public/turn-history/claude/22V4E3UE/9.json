{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- Current Blind: Big (need 450 chips)\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 3\n- Money: $4\n- Joker: Zany Joker (+12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n4. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n5. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\nLet me check for pairs and potential hands:\n- Kings: King of Spades, King of Diamonds - **PAIR!**\n- Jacks: Jack of Spades - only one\n- 7s: 7 of Spades, 7 of Diamonds - **PAIR!**\n- 10s: 10 of Diamonds - only one\n- Aces: Ace of Diamonds - only one\n- 3s: 3 of Clubs - only one\n\nSo I have:\n- Two Pair: Kings and 7s\n\nLet me check if I can make Three of a Kind:\n- Looking at deck: King has 2 cards left, 7 has 2 cards left\n- Jack has 3 cards left, Ace has 3 cards left\n- 10 has 2 cards left\n\nI don't have Three of a Kind yet, but I have Two Pair.\n\n**Option 1: Play Two Pair (Kings and 7s)**\nLet me calculate:\n- Base chips for Two Pair: 20\n\n\n- Cards that participate: King (10), King (10), 7 (7), 7 (7) = 34 chips from cards\n- Total chips: 20 + 34 = 54 chips\n- Base mult for Two Pair: 2\n- Zany Joker doesn't activate (no Three of a Kind)\n- Total mult: 2\n- Total score: 54 × 2 = 108 chips\n\nThat's way too low - I need 450 chips!\n\n**Option 2: Discard and try to get Three of a Kind**\nThe Zany Joker's +12 mult multiplier would be crucial if I can hit Three of a Kind. I should discard the singleton cards that don't contribute to any pair or potential three-of-a-kind, focusing on keeping cards that have duplicates in the remaining deck.\n\nLooking at the deck composition, Jack, Ace, and 3 each have three copies left, making them the strongest candidates to build toward. If I keep one of these and draw two more, I'd trigger the Zany Joker. Alternatively, I could hold onto both pairs and try to draw a third card that matches one of them.\n\nWith King and 7 both having two cards remaining, either could complete a full house or three of a kind. The Zany Joker's +12 Mult bonus for three of a kind makes this particularly valuable—a three of a kind with 7s would score around 765 chips, while Kings would generate similar value through their higher base chip count.\n\nI should prioritize keeping both Kings and both 7s since they have the best odds of completing, then discard lower-value cards like the 3 of Clubs, Jack of Spades, and 10 of Diamonds to maximize my chances of drawing the remaining cards I need. Diamonds - DISCARD\n8. 7 of Diamonds - KEEP\n\nI'm discarding the Jack of Spades, 3 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, and 10 of Diamonds to maximize my chances of hitting a third King or 7.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,4,5,7]"}
