{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $15\n- Max Jokers: 6 (I have 5/6 jokers, so I have 1 open slot)\n\n**My Jokers (5/6):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (for 5 jokers) - will become +18 if I get a 6th joker\n5. Acrobat (Negative edition) - X3 Mult on final hand + +1 Joker slot\n\n**Shop Items:**\nCards:\n1. Uranus (Planet) - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips ($3)\n2. The Hierophant (Tarot) - Enhances 2 selected cards to Bonus Cards (+30 extra chips) ($3)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently ($10)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nCurrent reroll cost is $7, which would leave me with $8.\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Four of a Kind: Level 4 (my strongest, 7,052 chips last time)\n- Flush: Level 2 (4,896 chips)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (played 5 times, various chips 1,350-1,890)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (played 2 times, 2,132 chips)\n\n\n- Uranus doesn't align with my strategy since Two Pair isn't a core hand. The Hierophant offers more immediate value by boosting chip generation on specific cards for just $3. The Jumbo Pack could add flexibility but feels less impactful than direct chip increases. Tarot Merchant is expensive at $10 and represents a longer-term payoff that might not justify the cost right now.\n\nI'm weighing whether to fill my empty joker slot with another $7 reroll, invest $3 in The Hierophant for chip scaling, or save resources for the next round. Since I have that open slot, finding a joker would be ideal, but The Hierophant could provide solid immediate returns if the reroll doesn't pan out. a solid move since it's affordable and gives immediate value by upgrading 2 cards to Bonus Cards for +30 chips each. This leaves me with $12, which is better than gambling on another reroll with uncertain returns.\n\nAfter purchasing The Hierophant, I still have flexibility—I could reroll once more if something promising appears, or bank the remaining funds for the next shop. I'll go ahead and buy it.","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
