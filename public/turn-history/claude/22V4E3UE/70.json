{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $31\n- Just sold Turtle Bean for $3\n\n**My Jokers (4/5):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind ($2 sell)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards ($3 sell)\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored ($2 sell)\n4. Abstract Joker - +12 Mult (for 4 jokers) ($2 sell)\n\n**Shop Items:**\nCards:\n1. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round ($6)\n2. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining ($5)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - Choose 1 of 2 Spectral cards ($4)\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently ($10)\n\n**Hand Performance Analysis:**\n- Flush (Level 2): 4,896 chips (recent boss)\n- Four of a Kind (Level 4): 7,052 chips\n- Three of a Kind (Level 1): 1,350-1,890 chips\n\nI'm at Ante 4/8, which means chip requirements are going to scale significantly. The previous reasoning mentioned selling Turtle Bean, but I actually sold it already based on the state change.\n\nNow I need to decide what to buy:\n\n**Acrobat ($6):** X3 Mult on final hand is very powerful multiplicative scaling. This would work extremely well as a \"finisher\" joker when I need one big hand to win the round. With my current setup, if I can generate ~3,000 chips naturally, Acrobat would turn that into 9,000 chips.\n\n\nMystic Summit offers additive mult instead, requiring all discards to be used—less impactful than multiplicative scaling. The Spectral Pack is unpredictable; while it could provide strong effects like Ankh or Familiar, the variance is risky. My Wrathful Joker synergizes well with spade-heavy hands, making multiplicative effects more valuable than flat additions.\n\nAcrobat's X3 multiplier would amplify my existing joker setup significantly—Wrathful Joker's spade scaling, Sock and Buskin's face card retriggering, and the baseline mult from Abstract and Zany would all benefit from that multiplier on a final hand. This seems like the most impactful purchase with my $31 budget.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
