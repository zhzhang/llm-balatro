{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $10\n- I now have 5 jokers (max capacity)\n\n**Inventory:**\n1. Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n2. Sock and Buskin (Retrigger face cards)\n3. Wrathful Joker (+3 Mult per spade)\n4. Business Card (Money from face cards)\n5. Abstract Joker (+15 Mult with 5 jokers)\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Death Tarot - Convert one card into another - Cost: $3\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack - $6\nVouchers:\n1. Crystal Ball - +1 consumable slot - $10\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed, Reward $4\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed, Reward $5, Boss: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 120, Base Mult 13\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just bought Abstract Joker for $4, leaving me with $10. Now I need to decide what to do next.\n\nMy joker setup is now maxed at 5 jokers:\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retriggers face cards\n- Wrathful Joker: +3 Mult per spade card scored\n- Business Card: Money from face cards\n- Abstract Joker: +15 Mult (constant)\n\n\n- \nNow I'm working through the scoring potential. With Four of a Kind using 4 spade face cards, I get 120 base chips plus 13 mult. The face cards themselves add 40 chips. Zany Joker triggers since Four of a Kind contains Three of a Kind, giving +12 mult, while Abstract Joker adds +15 mult. The Wrathful Joker multiplies with each spade face card, and Sock and Buskin doubles the triggers on those cards.\n\nFor Three of a Kind with 3 spade face cards, the base is 30 chips and 3 mult, with the cards contributing 30 additional chips. The same Jokers apply here—Zany gives +12 mult and Abstract gives +15 mult—while Wrathful Joker provides 18 mult total from the three cards and their doubled triggers. Comparing the final scores, Four of a Kind yields significantly more chips than Three of a Kind.\n\nBoth hands clear the Big Blind and Boss Blind thresholds without difficulty. With $10 remaining, I'm weighing whether to invest in Death Tarot to help assemble Four of a Kind more reliably, grab Jumbo Standard Pack for additional deck cards, take Crystal Ball for an extra consumable slot, or reroll the shop. Since I'm already performing well against the upcoming blinds, I should prioritize flexibility—Crystal Ball's consumable slot could prove valuable later, though Death Tarot might accelerate my Four of a Kind strategy. Tarot ($3) for card conversion, Jumbo Standard Pack ($6) for potential additions, Crystal Ball ($10) to max out consumables, or Reroll ($5) to see different options. Since I'm already positioned well for the upcoming blinds, I should conserve resources. Death Tarot seems like the practical choice—it gives me flexibility for future rounds without draining my bankroll, leaving $7 remaining.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
