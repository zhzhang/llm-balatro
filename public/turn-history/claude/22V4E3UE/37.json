{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 6 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Current Hand:**\n1: 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2: 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3: 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4: 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n5: King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6: Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7: 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n8: 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of 4s (4 of Spades, 4 of Clubs)\n- Pair of 5s (5 of Spades, 5 of Diamonds)\n- Two Pair (4s and 5s)\n- High Card\n\n**Analysis:**\nI still don't have a Three of a Kind. I have two pairs (4s and 5s). The deck still has 2 more 4s and 2 more 5s.\n\nLet me calculate what I could score with what I have:\n\n**Two Pair (4s and 5s):**\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult\n\n\n- Cards scored: 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 18 chips, totaling 38 chips\n- Abstract Joker adds 15 mult for 17 total, and Wrathful Joker contributes 6 more mult from the two spades in the pair, bringing me to 23 mult\n- Since I don't have three of a kind, Zany doesn't activate\n- This scores 874 chips total, which still falls short\n\nI need to pursue a Three of a Kind instead. If I can add a third 4 or 5, I'd trigger a Full House with 40 chips and 4 base mult. The three of a kind would unlock Zany for 12 additional mult, and combined with Abstract's 15 mult, I'd reach 31 mult before Wrathful's spade bonus. However, the boss constraint means I can only play one hand type per round—once I commit to a hand, I'm locked in. My previous Three of a Kind attempt scored 1,890 chips, which is significantly stronger than what I'm getting now.\n\nI have three discards remaining to try drawing another 4 or 5. While I could theoretically build toward a pair of face cards since there are still Kings and Jacks in the deck, focusing on completing my existing pairs makes more sense given the remaining cards available.\n\nI'll discard the 10 of Spades, King of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds to maximize my chances of hitting that third matching card.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,5,6,8]"}
