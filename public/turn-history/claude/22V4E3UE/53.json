{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Current Blind: Big (3000 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 2132\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current Money: $11\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Analysis:**\nI need 3000 - 2132 = 868 more chips to win this round.\n\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Pair of 9s (9 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs)\n- Three spades (10, 5, 3)\n- Single cards: 4 of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds\n\nBest hands I can make:\n1. **Pair of 9s** - This is the best hand I can currently make\n2. High card if I play single cards\n\nLet me calculate the pair of 9s:\n- Base chips: 10\n- Played cards: 9 of Hearts (+9) + 9 of Clubs (+9) = 10 + 9 + 9 = 28 chips\n\n\n- Base mult: 2\n- Abstract Joker: +15 mult\n- Total mult: 2 + 15 = 17 mult\n- Total chips: 28 × 17 = 476 chips\n\nThis falls short of the 868 chips I need. With 2 discards and 3 hands remaining, I should consider what draws could help. The deck has 3 Aces, 3 8s, 4 Queens, 4 Jacks, 2 Kings, and only 1 more 9 available. If I could draw a third 9, I'd trigger Zany Joker and get 57 chips × 30 mult = 1,710 chips—well above my target. However, that's just a 1/30 chance per draw. I should also explore other three-of-a-kind possibilities with the remaining cards.\n\nFor my discard strategy, I can only remove 5 cards at a time, so I need to be selective. I'll hold onto both 9s and consider which other cards to keep. The 10 of Spades could be valuable for Wrathful Joker if I build around spades.\n\nLooking at the remaining hands and discards available, I should focus on maximizing my chances of hitting a third 9 or assembling another matching set. Keeping just the pair of 9s and discarding the rest gives me the best odds of drawing into something useful—either another 9 for three of a kind, or face cards that synergize with Sock and Buskin.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,7,8]"}
