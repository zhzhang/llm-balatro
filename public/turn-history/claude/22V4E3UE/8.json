{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- Current Blind: Big (need 450 chips)\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 4\n- Money: $4\n- Joker: Zany Joker (+12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n7. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n8. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at my current hand, I don't see any immediate pairs or Three of a Kind. Let me check:\n- Spades: Jack, 10, 4 (no pairs)\n- Hearts: 2 (only one)\n- Clubs: 9, 6 (no pairs)\n- Diamonds: Ace, King (no pairs)\n\nNo pairs in this hand. I have:\n- 3 Spades (Jack, 10, 4)\n- 1 Heart (2)\n- 2 Clubs (9, 6)\n- 2 Diamonds (Ace, King)\n\nI could make a flush if I get more Spades, but that's only 3 right now.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI have Zany Joker which gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind hands. My best bet is to discard and try to draw into a Three of a Kind.\n\nLooking at the deck composition:\n- Most ranks have 3-4 cards remaining\n- 5, 7, Queen, 3, 8 all have 4 cards\n\n\n- Ace has 3 cards (I hold 1), and 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, Jack, King all have 3 cards remaining\n\nSince I need to make a Three of a Kind, I should discard cards that are unlikely to help me, and keep high-value cards that might pair up. Playing a high card hand would only give me around 16 chips, which is far too low to reach the blind. I need to focus on building toward the Three of a Kind to activate the Zany Joker's multiplier.\n\nWith 4 discards available, I'll keep the three highest-value cards—Jack, King, and Ace—since each has three copies remaining in the deck, giving me a reasonable chance of pairing up on the draw. I'll discard the lower-value cards to cycle through and find matches.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
