{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $7\n- My previous action to buy Hanging Chad (position 1) failed\n\n**Why did it fail?**\nThe error says \"Cannot buy card at position 1\". Looking at the shop cards:\n1. Hanging Chad - Joker card - $4\n2. To the Moon - Joker card - $8\n\nI already have 6 jokers (at max capacity). I cannot buy another joker without selling one first.\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) - Sells for $4\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards - Sells for $3\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade - Sells for $2\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active) - Sells for $2\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative - Sells for $5\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - Sells for $4\n\n**Analysis of which joker to potentially replace:**\n\nHanging Chad would retrigger the first played card 2 additional times. This is very powerful, especially with enhanced cards.\n\nLet me evaluate which joker is weakest:\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, with Polychrome X1.5 = great for my Three of a Kind strategy\n- Sock and Buskin: Retriggering face cards is good but requires face cards\n- Wrathful Joker: +3 Mult per spade - situational, only 6 chips of mult typically\n\n\n- Abstract Joker: +18 Mult always - solid baseline\n- Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand - extremely powerful for clutch situations\n- The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - core to my strategy\n\nWrathful Joker is the weakest link here. It only generates +3 Mult per spade, so playing two spades yields just +6 Mult—far less reliable than Abstract Joker's guaranteed +18 Mult. Hanging Chad's card retriggering effect would synergize well with my enhanced cards and could provide more consistent value than the Wrathful Joker's conditional spade bonus.\n\nWith $7 available, I'm weighing whether to sell a joker for Hanging Chad ($4), grab a Standard Pack ($4) for enhanced card chances, reroll ($5), or move forward. Since I'm at Ante 5/8 and my Three of a Kind engine is already strong, I need scaling options. A Standard Pack could provide the enhanced cards that would make Hanging Chad's retriggering effect particularly potent, creating a solid path to scale through the remaining antes.\n\nThe most efficient approach seems to be selling Wrathful Joker first—my weakest joker—to reach $9, then purchasing Hanging Chad for $4, leaving me with $5 to potentially grab a Standard Pack afterward. This two-step sequence would give me both the retrigger effect and enhanced cards to work with, though I need to verify whether Hanging Chad's power justifies the investment over other scaling options.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
