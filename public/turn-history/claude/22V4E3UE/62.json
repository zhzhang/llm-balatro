{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in a STANDARD_PACK phase\n- I need to choose 1 of 3 playing cards to add to my deck\n- Current Money: $19\n- I have 5 jokers (at max capacity)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips, Earns $3 when played and scores\n2. 5 of Diamonds - +5 chips (basic card)\n3. 6 of Spades - +6 chips, Wild Card (can be used as any suit), Creates a Planet card for final played poker hand of round if held in hand\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nOption 1: **8 of Clubs** - +8 chips, Earns $3 when played and scores\n- This is a decent card that generates money\n- But I already have $19 and money isn't my main constraint\n- The +8 chips is decent but not exceptional\n\nOption 2: **5 of Diamonds** - +5 chips\n- This is just a basic card with no special abilities\n- Not particularly useful\n\nOption 3: **6 of Spades** - +6 chips, Wild Card, Creates Planet card if held in hand\n- This is VERY valuable! It's a Wild Card (can be used as any suit)\n- More importantly, it creates a Planet card for the final played poker hand if held in hand\n- This means I can level up my most-played hand types (Three of a Kind) for FREE at the end of each round\n- It's also a Spade, which synergizes with Wrathful Joker (+3 Mult per spade scored)\n\n\n- The chip value is lower than the 8 of Clubs, but the utility far outweighs that tradeoff. The 6 of Spades gives me a Wild Card for hand flexibility and generates free Planet cards each round to continuously upgrade Three of a Kind, which directly supports my core strategy. Plus it triggers Wrathful Joker for bonus Mult. Position 3 is the clear winner.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
