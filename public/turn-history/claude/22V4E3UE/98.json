Jack of Hearts - +10 chips\\n3. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\\n4. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\\n5. 7 of Clubs - +7 chips\\n6. 4 of Clubs - +4 chips\\n7. 2 of Clubs - +2 chips\\n\\n**Hand Analysis:**\\n- I have a PAIR of 9s (positions 3 and 4)\\n- I have a FLUSH potential with 4 Clubs (7\\u2663, 4\\u2663, 2\\u2663 and need one more)\\n- No three of a kind yet\\n\\n**My Jokers:**\\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)\\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards (Jack would retrigger)\\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade (6\\u2660 gives +3)\\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active)\\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand (not yet, still have 4 hands)\\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\\n\\nMy build is heavily optimized for Three of a Kind. I need to get a three of a kind to maximize my jokers.\\n\\n**Remaining Deck:**\\n- 9s: 2 remaining (I could get a third 9)\\n\\n\\n- 6s: 4 remaining (I could get more 6s)\\n- Jacks: 2 remaining (I could get more Jacks)\\n- 4s: 2 remaining\\n- 2s: 2 remaining\\n- 7s: 1 remaining\\n\\nWith one discard left, I should focus on completing a three of a kind. The 9s are my best shot since I already have a pair, and there are still two in the deck. Alternatively, the 6s have four copies remaining, giving me decent odds of drawing another one.\\n\\nIf I just play the pair of 9s without improvement, I'd only score 560 chips\\u2014nowhere near the 10,000 I need. A three of a kind is essential to reach my target.\\n\\nWith three 9s, I'd get 30 base chips plus 27 from the cards themselves. The multipliers stack significantly: base mult of 3, plus 12 from Zany Joker, plus 18 from Abstract Joker, and The Trio adds another X3 multiplier. Zany Joker's polychrome effect pushes the additive multipliers to 49.5, which combined with The Trio's X3 should get me much closer to the score I need.\\n\\nIf I add the 6\\u2660 to the hand, the Wrathful Joker triggers for an additional +3 mult. This bumps my total additive multipliers to 36, which becomes 54 after the polychrome effect. The Trio multiplies that to 162, and 63 chips times 162 mult gives me just over 10,000 points.\\n\\nAlternatively, playing the Jack with Sock and Buskin would retrigger it, effectively counting it twice. That setup yields 77 total chips and 148.5 mult, reaching 11,434.5 chips. My best path forward is using my final discard to hunt for a third 9, then playing all three with the Jack to maximize the retrigger bonus. I should discard the weakest cards\\u2014the 6\\u2660, 7\\u2663, 4\\u2663, and 2\\u2663 are all isolated and won't contribute to any scoring patterns. four of them to improve my odds of drawing a third 9 or a better card to pair with what I'm holding.\\nCommand: discard 1 5 6 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 97]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

Ace of Hearts - +11 chips\\n4. Jack of Hearts - +10 chips\\n5. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\\n6. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\\n7. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips\\n\\n**Hand Analysis:**\\n- I have a PAIR of 9s (positions 5 and 6)\\n- I have 2 Spades (10\\u2660, 8\\u2660) and 2 Clubs (9\\u2663, 6\\u2663) - not enough for a flush\\n- I have potential for a straight: 10-9-8-7-6 but I'm missing the 7\\n- Face cards: Jack of Hearts, Ace of Hearts\\n\\n**My Jokers:**\\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)\\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active)\\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand (4 hands remaining, so not final yet)\\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\\n\\nI have 0 discards left, so I must play a hand now. My build is optimized for Three of a Kind, but I only have a pair of 9s. \\n\\nPlaying the pair of 9s with both face cards gives me a solid foundation. The 9\\u2665 and 9\\u2663 contribute 18 chips to the pair, while the J\\u2665 and A\\u2665 will be retriggered by Sock and Buskin, multiplying their value. Abstract Joker adds a flat 18 mult, and Wrathful Joker contributes 6 mult from the two spades I'd include.\\n\\nHowever, I need to verify the scoring rules\\u2014only cards that are part of the highest hand actually count their chip values. If the J\\u2665 and A\\u2665 aren't part of the pair itself, they won't contribute chips unless they're being scored separately through the retrigger mechanic. to-right)\\\". Only cards that score as part of the hand trigger their chip values. Face cards outside the scoring hand don't contribute chips, though they might activate \\\"when played\\\" effects.\\n\\nLet me reconsider the best possible hand. A Pair of 9s gives me 10 base chips plus 9 chips from each 9, totaling 28 chips. With a base multiplier of 2 and the Abstract Joker adding 18 mult, I get 28 \\u00d7 20 = 560 chips\\u2014far short of 10,000. I should explore whether a straight is possible with my cards.\\n\\nFor a 10-9-8-7-6 straight, I'd need all five ranks, but I'm missing the 7. The Wrathful Joker triggers when Spades are scored, not just played, so they must be part of the hand itself. If I include Spades like 10\\u2660 and 8\\u2660 in a scoring hand with the 9s, I'd gain additional multipliers from the Wrathful Joker, though this still seems insufficient to reach the target.\\n\\nWithout three of a kind available, my strongest option is playing a pair. I'm reconsidering whether the Sock and Buskin joker\\u2014which retriggersface cards\\u2014would activate twice if I include a Jack and Ace alongside the pair, even if they don't directly contribute chips. Based on earlier calculations showing three 9s with a Jack yielding over 11,000 chips, there might be value in that approach, but I need to settle on my best available play. \\u2665, 9\\u2663, J\\u2665, A\\u2665)\\n\\nEstimated chips: 560 from this hand. With 4 hands left and needing 10,000 total, I'd need roughly 9,440 more chips across the remaining hands\\u2014that's a steep climb without drawing significantly better cards. Since I have no discards remaining, I can't improve what I'm holding. Playing the pair of 9s with the face cards is my best option here.\\nCommand: play 5 6 3 4 pair 560\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 98]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

Queen of Clubs - +10 chips\\n7. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips\\n\\n**Hand Analysis:**\\nThis is amazing! I have:\\n- A STRAIGHT FLUSH: 10\\u2660-9\\u2660-8\\u2660-7\\u2660-6\\u2660 would be a straight flush, but I don't have 6\\u2660, I have 6\\u2665\\n- A STRAIGHT: 10-9-8-7-6 (positions 1,2,3,4,5)\\n- A FLUSH: 10\\u2660-9\\u2660-8\\u2660-7\\u2660 (4 spades, need 5 for flush)\\n- A PAIR of 6s (positions 5 and 7)\\n\\nWait, let me recheck. I have 10\\u2660, 9\\u2660, 8\\u2660, 7\\u2660 which are 4 spades, and then 6\\u2665, Q\\u2663, 6\\u2663. \\n\\nSo I can make:\\n- A STRAIGHT: 10-9-8-7-6 using positions 1,2,3,4,5 (10\\u2660, 9\\u2660, 8\\u2660, 7\\u2660, 6\\u2665)\\n\\n\\n- A PAIR of 6s: using positions 5,7 (6\\u2665, 6\\u2663)\\n\\nThe straight is clearly superior. For the straight hand, I get 30 base chips plus 40 from the card values (10+9+8+7+6), totaling 70 chips. The multiplier starts at 4 for a Level 1 straight, then the Wrathful Joker adds 12 mult from the four spades scored, and the Abstract Joker provides additional mult\\n\\n. With all bonuses combined, I reach 34 total multiplier, giving me 2,380 chips on this hand alone. Adding my current 588 chips brings me to 2,968 total.\\n\\nI still need 7,032 more chips across my remaining 2 hands to hit 10,000. Let me compare what the pair of 6s would yield instead\\u2014it starts with just 10 base chips and 12 from the card values. 2,380 \\u00d7 3 = 7,140 chips, which combined with 588 would give me 7,728 chips - still short.\\n\\nI need to think strategically about what cards remain in the deck. There's one more 9 available, two more 6s, and several face cards that could retrigger my effects. Since I don't have discards left to search for better combinations, playing the straight now makes sense - I can hope to hit a three of a kind in my remaining hands to activate Zany Joker and The Trio.\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 5 straight 2380\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- Boss Blind: \"First hand is drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 3,528\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 0\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**I need:** 10,000 - 3,528 = 6,472 more chips with just 2 hands remaining.\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades - +11 chips\n2. Queen of Clubs - +10 chips\n3. Jack of Clubs - +10 chips\n4. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips\n5. 3 of Clubs - +3 chips\n6. Ace of Diamonds - +11 chips\n7. Jack of Diamonds - +10 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a PAIR of Aces (positions 1 and 6)\n- I have a PAIR of Jacks (positions 3 and 7)\n- I have TWO PAIR (Aces and Jacks)\n- I have 4 Clubs (Q♣, J♣, 6♣, 3♣) - not enough for flush\n- I have 3 face cards: Q♣, J♣, J♦\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand (2 hands remaining, so not final yet)\n\n\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\nI should hold Acrobat for the final hand since I have two hands left. Playing Two Pair with my Aces and Jacks (positions 1, 6, 3, 7) gives me 20 base chips plus 42 card chips, multiplied by my active jokers. The Wrathful Joker adds 3 Mult for the Ace of Spades, while Sock and Buskin retrigggers my three face cards for additional scoring. (A♠) + 11 (A♦) + 10 + 10 (J♣ twice) + 10 + 10 (J♦ twice) = 82 chips total.\n\nThe multiplier comes to 2 + 3 + 18 = 23. Multiplying these gives 82 × 23 = 1,886 chips for this hand. Combined with my previous score, that puts me at 5,414 chips—still 4,586 short of the goal. I need to think strategically about my final hand and whether Acrobat's X3 multiplier could bridge that gap. Playing Q♣ alongside the jacks would create a pair instead, which changes the hand ranking. With Acrobat's X3 multiplier on my final hand, even a modest setup with around 25 mult and 60 chips would yield 4,500 chips. Playing this Two Pair now gets me 1,886, leaving 4,586 needed—which breaks down to roughly 61 chips required before the Acrobat multiplier kicks in. That's definitely within reach with a solid final hand.\n\nI'll go ahead and play the Two Pair using all four cards. But I'm wondering if adding Q♣ as a fifth card makes sense, since it wouldn't contribute to the Two Pair scoring itself but could potentially retrigger Sock and Buskin as a face card. Looking at the rules though, cards outside the highest hand don't trigger any effects or add chips, so Q♣ would be dead weight. I'm sticking with just the four-card Two Pair."
