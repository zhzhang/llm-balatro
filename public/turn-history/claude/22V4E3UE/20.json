{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $6\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n- Wrathful Joker: Played cards with Spade suit give +3 Mult when scored\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 3, so 2 slots available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 0, so 2 slots available)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Business Card - Played face cards have a 1 in 2 chance to give $2 when scored. Cost: $4\n2. Turtle Bean - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round. Cost: $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Crystal Ball - +1 consumable slot. Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy current strategy revolves around:\n- Playing Three of a Kind or Four of a Kind hands (Four of a Kind is Level 2 now)\n- Using face cards to trigger Sock and Buskin's retrigger effect\n- Zany Joker gives +12 Mult for hands containing Three of a Kind\n- Wrathful Joker now adds +3 Mult per Spade card scored, and this triggers twice for Spade face cards due to Sock and Buskin\n\n**Options with $6:**\n1. Business Card ($4) - Generates money when face cards score. This synergizes with my face card strategy and helps build economy.\n2. Turtle Bean ($6) - +5 hand size for this round, then degrades by 1 each round. This would help me find face cards and Three/Four of a Kind combinations more easily.\n\n\n3. Reroll ($5) - See new options, leaving me with $1\n4. Round Select - Save the money and move on\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nBusiness Card could generate significant value since Sock and Buskin doubles my face card triggers—three face cards in a Three of a Kind would score six times, potentially earning $6 on average. Turtle Bean would consume all my money but expand my hand size substantially, making it easier to assemble the combinations I need. Rerolling leaves me with minimal funds but might reveal better options, while passing preserves capital for future rounds.\n\nThe Business Card seems strongest because it maintains economy while synergizing with my existing strategy. Turtle Bean's hand size boost is powerful but temporary and depletes my resources entirely. I'll go with the Business Card—it costs $4, leaves me $2 for interest, and builds sustainable value through repeated face card scoring across multiple rounds.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
