{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 6 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Current Hand:**\n1: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n2: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n3: Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n4: 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n5: 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n6: 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7: 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n8: 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\nSo I have:\n- Pair of Aces (both Hearts)\n- Pair of 5s (Spades and Diamonds)\n- Pair of 4s (Clubs and Diamonds)\n- Jack of Spades\n- 2 of Spades\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\nWait, what happened with my previous action? I tried to use Death to convert Ace of Hearts to 4 of Spades, but looking at my hand, I now have TWO Ace of Hearts instead of having more 4s. It seems the Death consumable didn't work as expected, or maybe I had a different card layout than I thought.\n\nLet me analyze what I can play now:\n\n**Possible hands:**\n\n\nTwo Pair with Aces and 5s would give me 52 chips (20 base + 32 from card values), with a 2x multiplier from the hand type. The Abstract Joker adds 15 mult on top of that.\n\nThe Wrathful Joker contributes an additional 3 mult from the 5 of Spades, bringing the total multiplier to 20. That yields 1,040 chips—still short of the target.\n\nAlternatively, pairing Aces with 4s produces 50 chips total (20 base + 30 from cards), but without any Spades in that combination, the Wrathful Joker doesn't activate. The multiplier only reaches 17, resulting in 850 chips. Neither option gets me to 1,600.\n\nI should look for a stronger hand. I have three more Aces available in the deck, so if I draw another one, I'd trigger Three of a Kind and activate the Zany Joker. With three Aces, I'd score 33 chips from the cards themselves, plus 30 base chips for 63 total. The base multiplier of 3 combines with Zany Joker's +12 and Abstract Joker's +15, though the Aces won't help with Wrathful Joker since they're not Spades.\n\nThat gives me 1,890 chips—enough to win. I'll discard the Jack, 2, 6, and 8 to keep both Aces and the 5s, betting on drawing a third Ace. With 3 Aces left in a 36-card deck, I have roughly a 30% chance of hitting one across my remaining discards and hands.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,5,6,8]"}
