{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $19\n- I have 5 jokers (at max capacity)\n- No consumables (max 2 allowed)\n\n**Shop Inventory (all FREE!):**\n1. Turtle Bean (Uncommon Joker) - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round - Cost: $0\n2. Mars (Planet) - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips - Cost: $0\n\n**Booster Packs:**\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - Cost: $0\n\n**Recent Actions:**\n- I successfully bought the Mega Arcana Pack and used The Lovers on the Queen of Hearts (making it a Wild Card) and The Tower on the 3 of Diamonds (making it a Stone Card)\n- Now I'm back in the shop with remaining free items\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards (weakest)\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Analysis of Remaining Shop Items:**\n\n1. **Turtle Bean** - +5 hand size (degrades by 1 each round)\n   - This is extremely powerful! Having more cards in hand gives more options for forming hands\n   - However, I'm at max joker capacity, so I'd need to sell one first\n   - Business Card is my weakest joker (only generates money, not chips/mult)\n\n2. **Mars** - Levels up Four of a Kind\n   - Four of a Kind is level 3, I've only played it once\n   - Three of a Kind remains my primary strategy with 5 plays, but since Mars is free, leveling Four of a Kind provides additional value without opportunity cost\n\n3. **Standard Pack** - Add a playing card to deck\n   - Could potentially get another face card or useful card\n   - FREE, so worth considering\n\n**Best Strategy:**\nSince everything is free, I should maximize value:\n\n1. First, buy Mars (the planet card) - It's free and even though Four of a Kind isn't my main strategy, leveling it up doesn't hurt\n2. Then buy the Standard Pack - Free playing card\n3. Consider selling Business Card and buying Turtle Bean - The hand size increase\n\nMars is a consumable that doesn't require target cards, so I'll use buy_and_use_consumable for position 2. The Standard Pack is a booster, so that requires buy_booster 1. I need to execute these in sequence, starting with Mars, then the booster pack.\n\nAfter that, I should sell the Business Card at position 4 and pick up Turtle Bean from the available cards. Mars gives an immediate benefit with no setup required, making it the logical first move.","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
