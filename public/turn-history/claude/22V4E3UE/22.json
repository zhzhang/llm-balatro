{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**Inventory:**\n- 4 Jokers (Zany, Sock and Buskin, Wrathful, Business Card)\n- 0 Consumables\n- Max Jokers: 5, Max Consumables: 2\n\n**Blind Options:**\n\n1. **Small Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 800\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Tag for skipping: Meteor Tag (Free Mega Celestial Pack)\n\n2. **Big Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 1200\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Tag for skipping: D6 Tag (Rerolls in next shop start at $0)\n\n3. **Boss Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 1600\n   - Reward: $5\n   - Boss Description: Play only 1 hand type this round\n   - Cannot skip\n\n**My Strategy:**\n- Built around playing Three of a Kind or Four of a Kind with face cards\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retrigger face cards\n- Wrathful Joker: +3 Mult per Spade (doubled on face cards)\n- Business Card: 50% chance to get $2 per face card scored\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me estimate my scoring power for the Small Blind:\n\nFor a Three of a Kind with 3 face cards (ideally Spade face cards):\n- Base: 30 chips + 3 mult\n- Each face card: ~10 chips (varies by rank)\n- 3 face cards = +30 chips, triggering twice due to Sock and Buskin = +60 chips\n\n\n- Total chips: 90 chips\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult = 15 mult total\n- If 3 Spade face cards: +3 mult each, triggered twice = +18 mult total = 33 mult\n- Total: 90 chips × 33 mult = 2,970 chips\n\nThis comfortably exceeds the 800 chip threshold. The real decision is whether skipping for the Meteor Tag makes sense—a free Mega Celestial Pack would level up hand types significantly, which could accelerate my deck's scaling.\n\nBut I'm short on cash. Playing the Small Blind nets me $3, bringing my total to $5 for shopping. If I skip, I stay at $2 with no shop opportunity before facing the Big Blind. The D6 Tag for skipping that would be valuable too, but I need immediate purchasing power. More importantly, the Boss Blind's restriction—playing only one hand type—actually synergizes with my Three of a Kind focus rather than working against it. I should take the Small Blind, secure the money, and leverage the favorable boss condition.","action":"\"play_round\""}
