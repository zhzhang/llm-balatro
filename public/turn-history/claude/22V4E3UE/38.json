{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 6 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Current Hand:**\n1: Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2: 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3: 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4: 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n5: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n6: 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7: 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n8: 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**Analysis of current hand:**\n- I have THREE 4s! (4 of Spades, 4 of Clubs, 4 of Diamonds) - this is a Three of a Kind!\n- I also have two 5s (5 of Spades, 5 of Diamonds) - this is a Pair\n- I have a Jack of Spades (face card)\n- 4 Spades total (Jack, 5, 4, 2)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**Calculating Three of a Kind with 4s:**\n\nIf I play all three 4s (positions 3, 6, 8):\n- Base chips: 30\n\n\n- Cards scored: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 chips\n- Total chips: 42 chips\n\nBase mult: 3\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult (Three of a Kind bonus)\n- Abstract Joker: +15 mult\n- Total mult so far: 30 mult\n\nThe 4 of Spades triggers Wrathful Joker for +3 mult, bringing total mult to 33 mult.\n\n**Final calculation:**\n42 chips × 33 mult = 1,386 chips\n\nThis falls short of 1,600, so I need to explore other options. Playing a Full House with three 4s and two 5s (positions 2, 3, 6, 7, 8) gives 62 chips and 37 mult, since the base chips increase to 40, both the 4 and 5 of Spades trigger Wrathful Joker for +6 mult total, and the hand still contains the Three of a Kind bonus for Zany Joker.\n\nThat multiplies to 2,294 chips—well above the threshold. I should verify this is better than sticking with Three of a Kind, especially since the boss rule locks me into one hand type per round. My earlier Three of a Kind scored 1,890 chips, so the Full House is stronger. I could also check if the Death consumable offers any advantage, but the Full House path seems solid. I have one 4 of Spades. If I convert the Ace of Hearts using Death, it becomes a 4 of Spades—a perfect copy including suit. That means I'd have two 4s of Spades, which changes the Wrathful Joker calculation since both cards would be spades. Let me reconsider whether converting the Jack of Spades instead might be better, though that would also affect the spade count differently.\n\nActually, converting the Ace gives me four 4s total: two of Spades, one of Clubs, one of Diamonds. That's a Four of a Kind hand. The scoring breaks down to 136 base chips multiplied by 46 from my jokers—the Zany and Abstract Jokers contribute significant multipliers, and the Wrathful Joker gains extra value from having two matching spades. This yields 6,256 chips, and since Four of a Kind reaches Level 3, the hand value scales even further.\n\nI'll activate the Death consumable to transform the Ace of Hearts into a 4 of Spades, then submit the Four of a Kind. The command targets the consumable at position 1, the card at position 5, and converts it using the 4 of Spades from position 3.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,5,3]"}
