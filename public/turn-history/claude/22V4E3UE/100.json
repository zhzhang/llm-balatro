{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $7\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) - Sells for $4\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards - Sells for $3\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade - Sells for $2\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active) - Sells for $2\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative - Sells for $5\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - Sells for $4\n\n**Shop Items:**\n- Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - $4\n- To the Moon - +1 interest per $5, +10 Mult, Holo - $8\n- Standard Pack x2 - $4 each\n- Magic Trick Voucher - Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just beat Ante 4 Boss blind and am now in Ante 5. The difficulty will increase significantly. I have $7 to spend.\n\nLooking at my jokers:\n- I have a strong synergy with Three of a Kind hands (Zany Joker + The Trio)\n- Acrobat is very powerful for final hands\n- Abstract Joker scales with number of jokers\n- Sock and Buskin retrigggers face cards\n- Wrathful Joker gives mult for spades\n\nShop options:\n1. **Hanging Chad ($4)** - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times. This could be very powerful if I play cards with good effects or enhancements. This would work well with my current setup.\n\n\n2. **To the Moon ($8)** - Out of reach with my current funds.\n3. **Standard Packs ($4 each)** - Would add enhanced cards to my deck.\n4. **Magic Trick Voucher ($10)** - Can't afford this.\n5. **Reroll ($5)** - Would leave me with only $2 remaining.\n\nThe Hanging Chad stands out as the strongest choice. Retriggering my first played card twice more creates powerful scaling, especially when combined with Sock and Buskin's face card retriggering and any card enhancements I might have. This synergy amplifies my existing Three of a Kind strategy while staying within budget.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
