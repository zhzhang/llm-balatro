{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $13\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots full)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (none currently)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Owned Vouchers:**\n- Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for your most played poker hand\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\nCards:\n1. The Hanged Man (Tarot) - Destroys up to 2 selected cards ($3)\n2. Marble Joker - Adds one Stone card to deck when Blind is selected, +50 Chips no rank or suit ($6)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards ($4)\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) - Most played (4 times)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3 (120 chips, 13 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Other hands mostly level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just bought the Telescope voucher for $10, leaving me with $13.\n\nNow I have the Telescope, which means any Celestial Pack I buy will always contain a Three of a Kind planet card. \n\nThe Telescope synergizes perfectly with my Zany Joker since Three of a Kind is my most-played hand. I should consider whether to invest in tarot effects like The Hanged Man for deck consistency, grab the Arcana Pack to access more card modifications, or reroll to find better options. The Marble Joker is less appealing since my joker slots are full and I'd need to sacrifice something valuable. Rerolling costs $5 and might surface better options, potentially another Celestial Pack that would make the Telescope worthwhile. But the Arcana Pack for $4 is guaranteed value—I get immediate access to tarot cards that could enhance my scoring cards or modify my deck, leaving me with $9 for future shops. Since the Telescope only pays off if I find another Celestial Pack, and that's uncertain, I'll go with the Arcana Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
