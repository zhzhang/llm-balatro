{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $0\n- Just got Polychrome edition on Zany Joker (X1.5 Mult)!\n\n**Current Jokers (6/6 - maxed out):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, WITH POLYCHROME (X1.5 Mult)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade card\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (with 6 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult if Three of a Kind\n\n**Consumables (1/2):**\n1. The Hierophant - Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Raised Fist: $5 (I have $0)\n- Buffoon Pack: $4 (I have $0)\n- Tarot Merchant voucher: $10 (I have $0)\n- Reroll: $5 (I have $0)\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 7,500 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Boss Blind: 10,000 chips needed, $5 reward (First hand drawn face down)\n\nSince I have $0 and can't afford anything in the shop, my only viable action is to proceed to the round select phase.\n\nLet me calculate my potential scoring with the Polychrome on Zany Joker:\n\nFor a Three of a Kind with face cards:\n- Base: 30 chips, 3 mult\n- Three face cards: +30 chips = 60 chips\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin retriggers: +30 more chips = 90 chips\n- Abstract Joker: +18 mult = 21 mult\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult = 33 mult\n- Zany Polychrome: X1.5 mult = 49.5 mult\n- The Trio: X3 mult = 148.5 mult\n- If spade cards: +3 mult each (let's say 2 spades) = +6 before multipliers\n\nI need to recalculate following proper scoring order: base chips first, then card enhancements, then additive mult bonuses, then multiplicative effects.\n\nStarting with 30 base chips, the three face cards add 30 more for 60 total. Sock and Buskin's retrigger pushes this to 90 chips. For multiplier, I start at 3, then add Abstract Joker's 18 (reaching 21), Zany Joker's 12 (reaching 33), and Wrathful's 6 from the spades (reaching 39). Zany Polychrome multiplies by 1.5 to get 58.5, then The Trio triples it to 175.5. This gives 90 × 175.5 = 15,795 chips. If this is the final hand, Acrobat's X3 multiplier brings it to 47,385.\n\nThis score crushes both the Big Blind and Boss Blind thresholds, so I'm ready to move forward without needing to spend any money.","action":"\"round_select\""}
