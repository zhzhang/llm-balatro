{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (3000 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $9\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (Steel Card - +10 chips, X1.5 Mult while in hand)\n2. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n3. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n5. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards (1 in 2 chance to give $2)\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Analysis of Current Hand:**\nLooking at the cards:\n- Pair of Kings (King of Spades, King of Diamonds)\n- Pair of 4s (4 of Hearts, 4 of Diamonds)\n- One 10 of Clubs\n- One 6 of Clubs\n- One 3 of Clubs\n- One 9 of Diamonds\n\nBest hand type I can currently make: **Two Pair** (Kings and 4s)\n\n**Two Pair Calculation:**\n- Base chips: 20\n\n\n- Base mult: 2\n- Scoring cards are the two Kings and two 4s, giving 48 total chips (20 base + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4)\n- Wrathful Joker adds 3 Mult since King of Spades is the only spade in play\n- Abstract Joker contributes 15 Mult\n- Steel Card on King of Spades provides X1.5 Mult multiplier, though I need to verify if it applies when the card stays in hand versus being played\n\n. If the King of Spades is played as part of the Two Pair, it won't remain in hand, so the Steel Card bonus wouldn't trigger. The bonus only works while the card stays in hand, so playing it disqualifies it from that bonus.\n\nWith both Kings and both 4s, I'd get 48 chips and 20 mult for 960 total—far short of the 3000 needed. I should discard strategically to build toward Three of a Kind, which would unlock the Zany Joker's +12 Mult bonus, or ideally Four of a Kind for even stronger scoring with 120 chips and 13 mult. The best approach is to keep the Kings or another strong pair and discard the remaining cards to chase a better hand.\n\nActually, keeping the Steel King of Spades in hand while playing other cards gives me the x1.5 multiplier—that's the key advantage I've been missing. If I discard the King of Diamonds and the low cards, I can draw toward a third 4 or another matching card to form Three of a Kind while the Steel King stays in hand for the multiplier boost. I need to complete the partial thought from the previous rewriting first. The sentence \"Cards to potentially keep:\n- King of Spades (Steel Card - MUST keep in hand for x1.5 mult)\n- Pair of 4s (building toward Three/Four of a Kind)\n- King of Diamonds (could build toward three Kings, but less likely since only 2 Kings left in deck\" ends with an incomplete thought about the King of Diamonds.\n\nLet me complete this: King of Diamonds (could build toward three Kings, but less likely since only 2 Kings left in deck).\n\nNow I'll summarize the next thinking: I should discard the low-value cards—10 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, and 9 of Diamonds—while keeping the King of Spades and pair of 4s. This leaves me with three cards in hand, and I'll draw five new ones to rebuild to eight cards, maximizing my chances of hitting a strong combination without losing the Steel Card's multiplier.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,7,8]"}
