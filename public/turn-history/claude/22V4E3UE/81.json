{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- Just won the Small Blind with 5,040 chips (needed 5,000)\n- Currently in SHOP phase\n- Money: $12\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 7,500 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Boss Blind: 10,000 chips needed, $5 reward, Effect: First hand is drawn face down\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade card\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (with 5 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. The Trio - X3 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind ($8)\n2. Raised Fist - Adds double the rank of lowest ranked card held in hand to Mult ($5)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards to be used immediately ($4)\n2. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards ($4)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently in the shop ($10)\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Trio looks VERY powerful. It's a X3 Mult joker specifically for Three of a Kind, which I've been playing a lot (6 times total). I already have Zany Joker which gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind. Combined, these would be incredibly strong.\n\n\nIf I add The Trio to my current setup, my Three of a Kind hands would multiply significantly. My last one scored 5,040 chips with 33 total mult (base 3 + Zany's 12 + Abstract's 15 + Wrathful's 3). Adding The Trio's X3 multiplier would push that to 99 mult, turning a 140-chip hand into roughly 13,860 chips—a massive jump that would easily clear the upcoming blinds.\n\nThe cost is steep though. With only $12 available and The Trio at $8, I'd be left with just $4. I'm weighing this against other options like Raised Fist for rank-based mult scaling or pack purchases for additional jokers or tarots, but The Trio's direct synergy with my Three of a Kind strategy makes it the strongest play. I still have one empty joker slot to fill, so I should verify what other resources I have available before committing. save the remaining funds for flexibility in upcoming shops rather than committing to another pack right now.\n\nThe Trio is the clear priority—it directly amplifies my most-used hand and will significantly boost my chip output against tougher blinds. Once purchased, I'll reassess whether the extra $4 is better spent on a booster pack or held in reserve.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
