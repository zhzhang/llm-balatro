{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 6 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\" - CRITICAL CONSTRAINT\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 0 (no more discards!)\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Current Hand:**\n1: Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2: 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n3: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n4: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n5: King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6: 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7: Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n\nWait, that's 7 cards listed. Let me recount:\n1: Ace of Spades\n2: 7 of Spades\n3: Ace of Hearts\n4: Ace of Hearts\n5: King of Hearts\n6: 5 of Clubs\n7: Ace of Diamonds\n8: 7 of Diamonds\n\nThat's 8 cards total.\n\nI have FOUR ACES! This is a Four of a Kind hand!\n- Ace of Spades (position 1)\n- Ace of Hearts (position 3)\n- Ace of Hearts (position 4)\n- Ace of Diamonds (position 7)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind (Four of a Kind contains Three of a Kind!)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards (Aces are face cards!)\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored (Ace of Spades counts!)\n\n\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**Calculating Four of a Kind with all 4 Aces (positions 1, 3, 4, 7):**\n\nFour of a Kind is Level 3:\n- Base Chips: 120\n- Base Mult: 13\n\nCards scored: All 4 Aces contribute their chip values = 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 44 chips\nTotal chips from cards = 120 + 44 = 164 chips\n\nNow for the multiplier:\n- Base mult: 13\n- Zany Joker adds +12 Mult since Four of a Kind contains Three of a Kind\n- Wrathful Joker adds +3 Mult for the Ace of Spades\n- Abstract Joker adds +15 Mult\n- Sock and Buskin retriggers all face cards (the 4 Aces), multiplying their contribution\n- Business Card generates additional money from the face cards scored\n\nEach Ace scores twice due to the retrigger—once initially for 11 chips, then again for 11 chips—giving 88 total chips from the Aces instead of 44.\n\nWith the Wrathful Joker triggering twice on the Ace of Spades, the multiplier jumps to 46 (base 13 + Zany's 12 + Abstract's 15 + two instances of Wrathful's 3). Multiplying 208 chips by 46 gives 9,568 chips, far exceeding the 1,600 needed. This is the winning play.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,7]"}
