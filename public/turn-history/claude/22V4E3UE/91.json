{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Boss Blind: Chips Needed 10,000\n- Boss Description: First hand is drawn face down\n- Reward: $5\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\n**Analysis:**\nThis is a Boss Blind that requires 10,000 chips. The boss effect is \"First hand is drawn face down\", which means I won't be able to see what cards I have in my first hand draw. This is The Serpent boss blind.\n\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- Last Big Blind (7,500 chips): I scored 14,175 chips with a Three of a Kind\n- Previous Small Blind: 5,040 chips with a Three of a Kind\n\nMy Three of a Kind build is very strong. Even though the first hand will be face down, I should be able to win this boss blind. After the first hand, I'll be able to see my cards normally.\n\nThe boss blind cannot be skipped, and I need to play it to progress. With my current joker setup optimized for Three of a Kind, I should be able to beat the 10,000 chip requirement.\n\nThe only available command in BLIND_SELECT is to play_round. I cannot skip boss blinds.\n\nI should play the round and deal with the face-down first hand challenge.","action":"\"play_round\""}
