{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $0\n- Next blind is the Boss Blind for Ante 5\n\n**My Current Jokers (6/6 - at max capacity):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5) - sells for $4\n2. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers × 3) - sells for $2\n3. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative edition - sells for $5\n4. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - sells for $4\n5. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - sells for $2\n6. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round - sells for $3\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Mail-In Rebate ($4) - Earn $5 for each discarded 4\n- Celestial Pack ($4) - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n- Magic Trick voucher ($10) - Playing cards can be purchased from shop\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\nI have $0, so I can't buy anything or reroll. I just bought Card Sharp which complements my Three of a Kind strategy perfectly.\n\nMy joker setup is now complete and optimized for Three of a Kind:\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult with polychrome x1.5 for Three of a Kind\n- Abstract Joker: +18 mult from joker count\n- Acrobat: x3 mult on final hand\n- The Trio: x3 mult for Three of a Kind\n- Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n\n- Card Sharp: x3 mult when replaying a hand type\n\nThis creates powerful synergy—playing Three of a Kind multiple times stacks all the multipliers, and if it's my final hand, Acrobat's x3 mult applies on top. With no funds available and my joker composition locked in, I should move forward to face the Boss Blind.","action":"\"round_select\""}
