{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $0\n- Just completed Small Blind and used a Celestial Pack to level up Three of a Kind to Level 2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5) - sells for $4\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards - sells for $3\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (with 6 jokers) - sells for $2\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand + 1 Joker slot, Negative edition - sells for $5\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - sells for $4\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 times - sells for $2\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Rocket: $6 (too expensive, I have $0)\n- Green Joker: $4 (too expensive)\n- Celestial Pack: $4 (too expensive)\n- Magic Trick Voucher: $10 (way too expensive)\n- Reroll: $5 (too expensive)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI have $0, so I can't buy anything. The only actions available are:\n1. Sell a joker or consumable (but I have no consumables)\n2. Rearrange jokers\n3. Round select to continue\n\nSince I have no money and can't afford anything in the shop, my best option is to proceed to the next blind. I should use `round_select` to finish shopping and move on to the Big Blind.\n\nBefore I do that, let me check if I should rearrange my jokers. The order matters because:\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the FIRST played card used in scoring\n\n\n- Zany Joker and The Trio both activate on Three of a Kind hands, with Zany's Polychrome multiplier applying during the independent joker phase\n- Acrobat triggers on the final hand\n- Abstract Joker provides consistent +18 mult regardless of position\n\nThe current arrangement works well for my Three of a Kind strategy, so I'll proceed to the next blind.","action":"\"round_select\""}
