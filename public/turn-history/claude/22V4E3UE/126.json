{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $3\n- Just upgraded Three of a Kind to Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult base)\n- Next blind is the Boss Blind for Ante 5\n\n**My Jokers (all focused on Three of a Kind):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers × 3)\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative edition\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Mail-In Rebate ($4) - Earn $5 for each discarded 4 (can't afford)\n- Card Sharp ($6) - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round (can't afford)\n- Celestial Pack ($4) - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards (can't afford)\n- Magic Trick voucher ($10) - Playing cards can be purchased from shop (can't afford)\n- Reroll cost: $5 (can't afford)\n\nWith only $3, I cannot afford any of the shop items or a reroll. The cheapest item is the Mail-In Rebate at $4, which I'm $1 short of.\n\nI could sell a joker to get more money, but let me evaluate if any of them are worth selling:\n- Zany Joker ($4) - Core to my Three of a Kind strategy with polychrome\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin ($3) - Retriggers face cards, adding value\n- Abstract Joker ($2) - Provides +18 mult from my joker count\n- Acrobat ($5) - X3 mult on final hand and provides extra joker slot\n- The Trio ($4) - X3 mult for Three of a Kind (core)\n- Hanging Chad ($2) - Retriggers first card 2 additional times\n\nI could sell Abstract Joker ($2) to reach $5, then buy Mail-In Rebate ($4), leaving me with $1. Alternatively, selling Sock and Buskin ($3) would give me $6 total, opening up more options.\n\nMail-In Rebate feels unreliable since it only generates $5 per discarded 4, making income inconsistent. Card Sharp is more compelling—it triggers X3 mult whenever I replay a hand type I've already used this round. Since I'm repeatedly playing Three of a Kind, this would stack significantly on my second and subsequent plays.\n\nComparing the trade: Sock and Buskin's face card retriggering is useful but peripheral to my strategy, whereas Card Sharp directly amplifies my core Three of a Kind plays with consistent multiplier scaling.\n\nFor the Ante 5 Boss with its steep chip requirements, that X3 mult multiplier becomes essential. My second Three of a Kind would triple its mult, and my third (when Acrobat triggers) would triple again. Looking at the actual damage: my base Three of a Kind hits 90 chips with 9 mult, Abstract Joker pushes it to 27 mult, Zany Joker with polychrome reaches 58.5 mult, The Trio triples it to 175.5 mult, and if it's my final hand with Acrobat, I'm at 526.5 mult. Adding Card Sharp's multiplier on top of this would be substantial.\n\nThe math is compelling—Card Sharp would push that final hand from 526.5 mult all the way to 1579.5 mult, nearly tripling my output. Sock and Buskin provides value, but it doesn't match the raw power of that X3 multiplier stacked on my repeated hands. I'm selling Sock and Buskin to fund Card Sharp.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
