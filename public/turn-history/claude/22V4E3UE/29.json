{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- I have 5 jokers (max capacity) and 1 consumable (Death tarot)\n\n**Inventory:**\nJokers:\n1. Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n2. Sock and Buskin (Retriggers face cards)\n3. Wrathful Joker (+3 Mult per spade)\n4. Business Card (Money from face cards)\n5. Abstract Joker (+15 Mult with 5 jokers)\n\nConsumables:\n1. Death - Convert one card into another\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n- No cards available\n- Jumbo Standard Pack - $6\n- Crystal Ball - $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed, Boss: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 120, Base Mult 13\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3\n\n**My Assessment:**\n\nI just bought Death tarot for $3, leaving me with $7. Now I need to decide what to do:\n\n1. **Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)** - Would leave me with $1. This could add a useful card to my deck, potentially helping me form Four of a Kind more easily.\n\n2. **Crystal Ball ($10)** - Too expensive, I only have $7.\n\n3. **Reroll Shop ($5)** - Would leave me with $2. Might reveal better options, but I already have a solid setup.\n\n4. **Round Select** - Move on to the Big Blind with my current setup.\n   \nMy current joker setup already generates well over the chips needed for both upcoming blinds—Four of a Kind alone produces over 10,000 chips. The Jumbo Standard Pack could help me more consistently form Four of a Kind by adding face cards of matching ranks, which would be especially useful given the Boss Blind's restriction to a single hand type. Since I have the funds and the potential benefit outweighs the cost, purchasing it seems like the right move. My deck already performs well, so adding more cards might actually dilute it and make it harder to draw what I need. I'll skip the shop and move to Round Select instead—I have Death tarot for conversions if needed, and my scoring is already solid enough to handle the upcoming blinds.","action":"\"round_select\""}
