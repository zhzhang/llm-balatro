{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 3 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss Effect: All Heart cards are debuffed (can't score chips or use abilities)\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 3 of Hearts (DEBUFFED)\n4. 2 of Hearts (DEBUFFED)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n7. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n8. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n\n**Available Non-Heart Cards:**\n- King of Spades\n- Queen of Spades\n- Queen of Diamonds\n- 9 of Clubs\n- 6 of Clubs\n- 2 of Clubs\n\nI have a pair of Queens (Spades and Diamonds). That's not a Three of a Kind, so I won't get the Zany Joker bonus.\n\nLet me think about what I can play right now:\n- Pair of Queens: This would score the base pair (10 chips + 2 mult), plus the two Queens would each contribute 10 chips (20 total), and with Sock and Buskin, each Queen would retrigger for another 10 chips each (another 20 chips). So: 10 base + 20 from queens + 20 from retriggers = 50 chips, times (2 base mult) = 100 chips. That's far from 600.\n\n\nI need to discard strategically to find a Three of a Kind that would trigger the Zany Joker. The Hearts are useless here, and the low-value Clubs (9, 6, 2) won't help much. I'll discard those five cards to draw fresh cards and hopefully build toward a stronger hand.\n\nAfter the discard, I'll have King of Spades, Queen of Spades, and Queen of Diamonds remaining. With 44 cards left in the deck, I have decent odds of hitting another Queen or King—there are 9 face cards still available. The Hearts are all debuffed anyway, so removing them opens up space for better draws.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,7]"}
