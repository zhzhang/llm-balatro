{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10 (in SHOP after beating Big Blind)\n- Current Money: $2 (down from $7 after rerolling)\n- Next blind will be Boss Blind (Ante 4 Boss)\n\n**My Jokers (very strong Three of a Kind setup):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\n**Current Shop:**\nCards:\n1. Superposition - Create Tarot if Ace + Straight - $4 (can't afford)\n2. Matador - Earn $8 if played hand triggers Boss Blind ability - $7 (can't afford)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - $4 (can't afford)\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack - $6 (can't afford)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - $10 (can't afford)\n\nReroll Cost: $6 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI only have $2 and can't afford anything in the shop. The reroll was not good - I can't buy anything now.\n\nSince I can't make any purchases, I should just move to the round select to face the Boss Blind.\n\nLooking at my last Three of a Kind hand, I scored 14,175 chips. Boss Blinds at Ante 4 typically require around 11,000-15,000 chips depending on the specific boss. \n\nWith this setup, I should have enough power to beat the boss. I'll proceed to the next round since there's nothing to purchase here.","action":"\"round_select\""}
