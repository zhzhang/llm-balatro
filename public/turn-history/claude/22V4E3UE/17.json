{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the current state and choose a planet card from the booster pack.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I'm in Ante 2/8, Round 3, in the SHOP phase, specifically looking at a Planet Pack (Celestial Pack)\n- I have $10 remaining\n- I have Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind) and Sock and Buskin (retrigger face cards)\n\nPlanet Pack Options:\n1. Jupiter - Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips)\n2. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n3. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult and +15 chips)\n\nLooking at my hand history:\n- Three of a Kind - 1,350 chips (most recent)\n- Full House - 1,344 chips\n- Three of a Kind - 153 chips\n- Three of a Kind - 180 chips\n- Two Pair - 88 chips\n\nI've played Three of a Kind THREE times and it's clearly my most successful hand type. My entire strategy revolves around it with Zany Joker giving +12 Mult for Three of a Kind hands.\n\nHowever, none of the planet cards offered level up Three of a Kind! This is unfortunate.\n\nLet me think about which is the best alternative:\n\n1. **Jupiter (Flush)**: I haven't played a single Flush yet. This doesn't align with my current strategy at all.\n\n2. **Mars (Four of a Kind)**: Four of a Kind is a natural progression from Three of a Kind. If I draw an extra card of the same rank as my three of a kind, I'd have Four of a Kind. It would level up to Base Chips 90 and Base Mult 10. However, my Zany Joker only triggers on Three of a Kind, not Four of a Kind, so I'd lose the +12 Mult bonus. This seems counterproductive to my strategy.\n   \nMercury (Pair) would be easier to form but represents a step backward—it's weaker than Three of a Kind and doesn't synergize with my Zany Joker either. Mars is tempting though, since Four of a Kind naturally contains a Three of a Kind within it. If the \"Contains\" rule applies here, I might still get the Zany Joker bonus even when playing Four of a Kind, which would make it a genuine upgrade to my strategy. d the rules say a hand \"contains\" another hand type if that hand type can be formed with the cards. Four of a Kind definitely contains Three of a Kind because you can form a Three of a Kind from any three of the four cards. So yes, Zany Joker should trigger on Four of a Kind!\n\nThis makes Mars the clear winner since it upgrades to a hand type that still activates my Zany Joker bonus while being stronger than Three of a Kind and naturally achievable when I'm already building toward it. Mercury would work too given that Three of a Kind contains a Pair, but the Four of a Kind is the superior option. Jupiter doesn't fit my current strategy. Mars at position 2 is the right choice.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
