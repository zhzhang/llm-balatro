{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $9\n- Just sold Wrathful Joker for $2 (had $7, now have $9)\n\n**Current Jokers (5/6):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) - Sells for $4\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards - Sells for $3\n3. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (3 per joker, now 5 jokers) - Sells for $2\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative - Sells for $5\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - Sells for $4\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - $4\n2. To the Moon - +1 interest per $5, +10 Mult, Holo - $8\n3. Standard Pack x2 - $4 each\n4. Magic Trick Voucher - $10\n5. Reroll - $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy strategy is built around Three of a Kind hands with:\n- Zany Joker (+12 Mult with Polychrome X1.5)\n- The Trio (X3 Mult)\n- Acrobat (X3 on final hand)\n- Abstract Joker (+15 Mult, now scales with 5 jokers)\n\nI have $9 to spend. My options:\n1. Buy Hanging Chad for $4, leaving $5\n2. Buy To the Moon for $8, leaving $1\n3. Buy Standard Pack for $4, leaving $5\n\n\n4. Reroll for $5, leaving $4\n5. Save money for next shop\n\nHanging Chad could be strong if I have enhanced cards in my deck that benefit from retriggering. To the Moon provides both scaling interest and a Mult boost with Holo edition, which would compound my money generation over remaining antes. Standard Packs give me more cards to work with, while a reroll might surface better options. I need to weigh immediate power against long-term economy for the final antes. Hanging Chad retriggering cards multiple times compounds their effects—each retrigger means additional chip and mult contributions. With my Sock and Buskin already in play, face cards get even more value since they'd be retriggered by all three effects simultaneously. The synergy here is strong: playing a Three of a Kind with a face card as the first card means it scores three times from Hanging Chad alone, plus additional retrigs from my existing jokers. After buying Hanging Chad for $4, I'd have $5 left to grab a Standard Pack, which could add enhanced cards that further amplify these retriggering effects.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
