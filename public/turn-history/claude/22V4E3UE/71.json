{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $25\n- Just bought Acrobat for $6\n\n**My Jokers (5/5):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (for 5 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round\n\n**Shop Items:**\nCards:\n1. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining ($5)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - Choose 1 of 2 Spectral cards ($4)\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently ($10)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at Ante 4/8, halfway through the game. The chip requirements will continue to scale significantly. Let me think about what else I should buy:\n\n**Mystic Summit ($5):** \n- +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n- This is additive mult, not multiplicative\n- Would require using all discards first\n- My joker slots are full (5/5), so I'd need to sell a joker to buy this\n- Abstract Joker currently gives +15 mult already, so this would just add another +15 when I have no discards\n- Not very compelling given I'd need to sell a joker\n\n**Spectral Pack ($4):**\n- Could provide powerful effects\n- Spectral cards can do things like duplicate jokers, destroy cards for benefits, etc.\n\n\n- Random, but potentially very powerful\n- Worth considering\n\n**Jumbo Standard Pack ($6):**\n- Adds playing cards to my deck\n- Could help me find better cards for my strategies\n- Less impactful than spectral cards typically\n\n**Tarot Merchant ($10):**\n- Makes tarot cards appear 2x more frequently\n- Long-term investment\n- I have $25, so I could afford this\n- Tarot cards can enhance playing cards, which could be valuable\n\n**Hand Performance Analysis:**\n- Four of a Kind (Level 4): 7,052 chips - my strongest hand\n- Flush (Level 2): 4\n\nThe Spectral Pack seems like the best value at $4—spectral effects can be game-changing, especially with duplication or destruction mechanics. Tarot Merchant is tempting for long-term scaling, but at $10 it's a significant investment when I need immediate power for the remaining antes. I could also grab a Jumbo Standard Pack ($6) or reroll ($6), leaving me with $19 either way. At this stage of the run, a Spectral Pack seems more valuable than standard cards—the one-time effects could meaningfully strengthen my setup. Cards like Ankh for duplicating a joker or Familiar for adding enhanced face cards would be particularly useful. That said, I've already secured Acrobat and have a decent joker core, so banking the money for upcoming shops might be the smarter long-term play.\n\nThe Spectral Pack at $4 offers strong upside with minimal cost, leaving me $21 to work with. Given I'm only at Ante 4 out of 8, having access to powerful effects now could make a real difference in the harder rounds coming up. I'll go with the Spectral Pack. rolling to see if there are better options. The Spectral Pack at $4 is a solid investment with potential for strong effects, so I'll grab it and move forward to the next round.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
