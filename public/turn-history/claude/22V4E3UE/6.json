{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1, in SHOP phase\n- Money: $4\n- Just got Zany Joker (+12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind)\n- Have beaten Small Blind, next is Big Blind\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Neptune (Planet) - $3 - Levels up Straight Flush\n2. Lusty Joker - $5 - +3 Mult per Heart card scored (can't afford)\n3. Standard Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of 3 playing cards\n4. Hieroglyph Voucher - $10 - Can't afford\n5. Reroll - $5 - Can't afford\n\n**What I can afford with $4:**\n- Neptune ($3) - Would leave me with $1\n- Standard Pack ($4) - Would leave me with $0\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have Zany Joker which gives +12 Mult for hands containing Three of a Kind. This synergizes well with my recent play pattern (played Three of a Kind twice).\n\nShould I buy Neptune?\n- Neptune levels up Straight Flush (+4 Mult and +40 chips)\n- I haven't played any Straight Flushes yet\n- Straight Flushes are hard to make and require 5 cards of same suit in sequence\n- This doesn't synergize with my current strategy\n- Not a good purchase\n\nShould I buy Standard Pack?\n- Adds a playing card to my deck\n- At Ante 1, my deck composition isn't critical yet\n- I already have Zany Joker for scaling\n- This could dilute my deck or help me make specific hands\n- Marginal benefit, not urgent\n\nShould I reroll?\n- Costs $5, I only have $4\n- Can't afford it\n\nShould I save money and proceed?\n- I'll be going to Big Blind next\n\n\n- After Big Blind, I'll earn more money ($1 per remaining hand + interest), giving me better purchasing power in the next shop\n- I already have one solid joker for scaling\n\n**Decision:**\n\nNeptune doesn't align with my Three of a Kind focus, and Standard Pack offers minimal value right now. I'll skip both and proceed to Big Blind, which will let me accumulate more funds for better shop opportunities later.","action":"\"round_select\""}
