{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $6\n- Just sold Sock and Buskin for $3\n- Next blind is the Boss Blind for Ante 5\n\n**My Current Jokers (5/6):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (5 jokers × 3)\n3. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative edition\n4. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Mail-In Rebate ($4) - Earn $5 for each discarded 4\n- Card Sharp ($6) - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n- Celestial Pack ($4) - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n- Magic Trick voucher ($10) - Playing cards can be purchased from shop\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy entire build is focused on Three of a Kind. I have exactly $6, which is enough to buy Card Sharp.\n\nCard Sharp gives X3 Mult if I've already played a poker hand type this round. Since I consistently play Three of a Kind multiple times per round, this will give me a massive multiplier boost on my 2nd and 3rd plays.\n\nLet me calculate the damage:\n- Base Three of a Kind: 90 chips, 9 mult\n- Abstract Joker: +15 mult → 24 mult\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult → 36 mult, then polychrome x1.5 → 54 mult\n\n\n- The Trio stacks on top with x3 mult → 162 mult, and if it's my final hand with Acrobat active that becomes x3 again → 486 mult. Card Sharp on subsequent plays multiplies this by another x3 → 1458 mult before Hanging Chad's retriggers add even more chips.\n\nThis is the right move—Card Sharp will massively amplify my Three of a Kind strategy heading into the Boss Blind.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
