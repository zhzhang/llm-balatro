{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 6 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\" - This is CRITICAL\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 1\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Current Hand:**\n1: 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n2: 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n4: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n5: King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6: 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n7: 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n8: 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of Aces (positions 3, 4)\n- Pair of 5s (positions 2, 8)\n- Two Pair (Aces and 5s)\n- Potentially a flush if I draw more hearts (I have 4 hearts: Ace, Ace, King, 4, 2)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have 3 Aces left in the deck (32 cards remaining). If I can get a third Ace, I'll have Three of a Kind which will activate Zany Joker.\n\nLet me calculate what I can score with what I have now:\n\n**Two Pair (Aces and 5s) - positions 2, 3, 4, 8:**\n\n\nPlaying this scores 52 chips with 20 multiplier (Abstract Joker's +15 and Wrathful Joker's +3 from the spade), giving me 1,040 chips total. That's still short of my 1,600 target.\n\n**Full House would need three of one rank and two of another:** I only have 2 Aces and 2 Fives, so this isn't possible with my current hand.\n\n**Trying a Pair of Aces with the King:** If I play positions 3, 4, 5 (Ace, Ace, King), I get 42 base chips plus 32 from the cards. With Abstract Joker adding 15 multiplier and Sock and Buskin retriggering the King, I need to clarify how card values actually contribute to the hand score—only cards that are part of the scoring combination count toward the base chip value.\n\nSo the two Aces form the pair with 10 base chips plus 22 from their card values, totaling 32 chips. The King doesn't contribute to the pair itself, though Sock and Buskin would retrigger it as a face card, but that doesn't generate additional chips since it's not part of the hand. I'm also constrained by the boss rule limiting me to one hand type per round, which I need to account for when planning my next move.\n\nMy strategy should focus on drawing a third Ace to upgrade to Three of a Kind. With one discard remaining and four hands left, the odds are roughly 9% per draw. I'll discard the low cards—6 of Spades, 4 of Hearts, and 2 of Hearts—while keeping the 5s since they could form Two Pair if needed.\n\nBut I need to consider my fallback. If the Ace doesn't come through, a Flush would be my next best outcome—it scored higher than Three of a Kind in my previous rounds. I have four hearts and need just one more from the remaining 32 cards, giving me about a 28% chance. The constraint is that once I commit to a hand type, I'm locked in for the rest of the round, so I can't pivot strategies mid-game.\n\nSince I haven't played any hands yet this round and still have one discard remaining, I should use it to chase one of my three possible improvements: a third Ace, a third 5, or that fifth heart. I'll discard the 6 of Spades along with other non-contributing cards to maximize my odds of hitting one of these combinations.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,6,7,8,2]"}
