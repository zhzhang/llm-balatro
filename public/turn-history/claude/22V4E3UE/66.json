{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Blind: Boss\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Boss Description: -1 Hand Size\n- Reward: $5\n- Current Money: $21\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (for 5 jokers)\n5. Turtle Bean - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round\n\n**Boss Blind Effect:**\nThe boss blind reduces hand size by 1. This is particularly relevant because:\n- I just acquired Turtle Bean which gives +5 hand size\n- With the boss effect of -1 hand size, Turtle Bean will give me a net +4 hand size\n- Base hand size is 8, so I'll have 8 + 4 = 12 cards in hand\n\n**My Recent Performance:**\n- Three of a Kind - 1,881 chips (Ante: 3, Big Blind)\n- Two Pair - 2,132 chips (Ante: 3, Big Blind)\n- Four of a Kind - 7,052 chips (Ante: 2, Boss)\n\nThe chips needed is 4000. Looking at my recent hands:\n- My Four of a Kind scored 7,052 chips (well above the threshold)\n- My Three of a Kind hands have been scoring around 1,800-1,900 chips\n- Two Pair scored 2,132 chips\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to score 4000 chips. With my current joker setup:\n- Zany Joker gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin retriggers face cards, Wrathful Joker adds +3 Mult per spade, and Abstract Joker provides +15 Mult\n- Turtle Bean gives +4 hand size (after boss effect)\n\nA Four of a Kind should easily exceed 4000 chips based on my last attempt scoring 7,052. Three of a Kind with face cards and spades would also work well. With 12 cards available, I'll have plenty of flexibility to build strong hands.\n\n**Decision:**\nSince this is a Boss blind and cannot be skipped, I need to commit to playing through it.\n\nThe -1 hand size penalty is actually beneficial here—Turtle Bean's +4 bonus more than offsets it. My joker setup is already optimized, so there's no value in rearranging or selling anything. I'll play the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
