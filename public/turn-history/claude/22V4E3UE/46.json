{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: TAROT_PACK (choosing from a tarot pack)\n- Current Money: $9\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots full)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (none currently)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. The Fool - Creates the last Tarot or Planet card used during this run (The Fool excluded) - Jupiter (Level up Flush +2 Mult and +15 chips)\n2. The Sun - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Hearts\n3. The Chariot - Enhances 1 selected card into a Steel Card (X1.5 Mult while this card stays in hand)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n4. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n5. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n6. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n7. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n8. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) - Most played (4 times)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3 (120 chips, 13 mult) - Played 1 time\n\n\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) - Played 1 time\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Fool would upgrade my Flush to Level 3, gaining 2 Mult and 15 chips. The Sun could convert my spades to hearts, which would strengthen my heart-based scoring since I already have three hearts in hand. I need to weigh whether leveling Flush or converting cards to create better hand combinations serves my current strategy better.\n\nThe Chariot stands out as the strongest option—it permanently enhances a card with x1.5 Mult whenever it stays in hand. Since my strategy centers on Three of a Kind with Zany Joker, Abstract Joker, and Wrathful Joker for spades, a steel card would multiply these bonuses across every hand I play going forward. This permanent boost compounds my existing synergies far more effectively than a one-time hand level increase.\n\nFor which card to enhance, I need something I won't play often—ideally a face card that benefits from Sock and Buskin's retriggering but that I can keep benched to maintain the x1.5 multiplier. A King or Queen of Spades would work well since they're face cards that synergize with my retrigger effects while staying out of play to preserve the steel enhancement bonus.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,1]"}
