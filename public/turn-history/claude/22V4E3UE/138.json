{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in Ante 6/8, Round 14\n- I'm in the SHOP phase\n- Current money: $8\n- I have a Venus planet card that levels up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult and +20 chips)\n\n**My Joker Setup:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (for 6 jokers)\n3. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Riff-raff: Creates 2 Common Jokers when Blind selected - $6\n2. Business Card: Face cards have 1/2 chance to give $2 when scored - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Spectral Pack - $6\n2. Standard Pack - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Hone: Foil/Holographic/Polychrome appear 2x more often - $10\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\nI just beat the Ante 5 Boss Blind with a strong Three of a Kind build. Looking at my last played hands, I relied heavily on Three of a Kind scoring, which makes sense given my joker setup (Zany Joker, The Trio both boost Three of a Kind).\n\nMy current Three of a Kind is Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult) and I have 11 plays with it. I have a Venus planet card that can level it up further.\n\nNow I need to think about Ante 6. The blinds are going to be much harder. Let me consider my options:\n\n\nUsing Venus would push Three of a Kind to 110 chips and 11 mult, strengthening my core strategy. Riff-raff could add jokers but I'm already at capacity. Business Card offers modest money generation. The Jumbo Spectral Pack is tempting but unpredictable, while Hone at $10 is out of reach with my current funds.\n\nWith $8 available, applying Venus first makes the most sense—it directly amplifies my primary hand without spending money. That leaves me with options like Business Card ($4) or Standard Pack ($4) to round out my turn, though I could also hold the remaining funds for future rounds.\n\nSince I'm at Ante 6 with increasingly demanding chip requirements, I should prioritize strengthening Three of a Kind through Venus, then move forward to assess what the next blinds will demand.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
