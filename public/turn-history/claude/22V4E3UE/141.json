{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 6/8, Round 14\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $2\n- Just used Grim spectral card which destroyed 1 card and added 2 Enhanced Aces to my deck\n\n**My Joker Setup:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (for 6 jokers)\n3. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Riff-raff: $6 (I only have $2)\n- Business Card: $4 (I only have $2)\n- Standard Pack: $4 (I only have $2)\n- Hone voucher: $10 (I only have $2)\n- Reroll: $5 (I only have $2)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI currently have only $2, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop. My options are:\n1. Sell a joker to get more money\n2. Go directly to round_select\n\nSince I'm at max capacity with 6 jokers and all of them are synergistic with my Three of a Kind build, selling any of them would weaken my strategy. Let me think about whether any shop items are worth it:\n\n- Riff-raff ($6): Would create 2 Common Jokers when blind selected, but I'm already at max capacity. I'd need to sell jokers to make room, which doesn't seem worth it.\n- Business Card ($4): Gives money when face cards score. This could help with income but doesn't directly boost my scoring.\n\n\n- Standard Pack ($4): Could add enhanced cards to my deck, which might be useful.\n- Hone voucher ($10): Too expensive even if I sell jokers.\n\nMy Three of a Kind is now Level 5 with solid scaling (110 chips, 11 mult), and I've just strengthened my deck with Enhanced Aces. Since I can't afford anything meaningful without dismantling my synergies, I should move forward to the next round.","action":"\"round_select\""}
