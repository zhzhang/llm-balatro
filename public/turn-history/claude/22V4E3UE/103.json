{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**Current Jokers (6/6 - at max capacity):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) - Sells for $4\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards - Sells for $3\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (3 per joker, now 6 jokers) - Sells for $2\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative - Sells for $5\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - Sells for $4\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - Sells for $2\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. To the Moon - +1 interest per $5, +10 Mult, Holo - $8 (can't afford)\n2. Standard Pack x2 - $4 each (can afford 1)\n3. Magic Trick Voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n4. Reroll - $5 (can afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just bought Hanging Chad and now have $5 left. My options are:\n1. Buy a Standard Pack for $4, leaving $1\n2. Reroll the shop for $5, leaving $0\n3. Save money and proceed to round select\n\nMy current joker setup is very strong for Three of a Kind:\n- Zany Joker gives +12 Mult with Polychrome X1.5\n- The Trio gives X3 Mult\n- Hanging Chad will retrigger the first played card 2 additional times\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin will retrigger face cards, while Abstract Joker adds +18 Mult and Acrobat multiplies the final hand by X3\n\nA Standard Pack could give me enhanced cards with effects like Mult or Bonus that would be retriggered multiple times through Hanging Chad, making them significantly more valuable. The question is whether that potential upside justifies spending $4 now versus rerolling for better shop options or saving the money.\n\nI'm at Ante 5/8 and need to scale up, so I should weigh the immediate benefit of enhanced cards against the opportunity cost. A $5 reroll might not yield anything better, and $4 for a Standard Pack is reasonable. But if I spend $4, I'll have $1 left with no interest at round's end, whereas keeping $5 gives me $1 interest. The real question is whether the enhanced cards I get are worth sacrificing that $1 interest and leaving myself with minimal funds going forward.\n\nSince Hanging Chad retrigggers cards, enhanced cards become significantly more valuable—a single Mult, Glass, or Bonus card could be played multiple times. That scaling potential justifies the investment. I'll buy the Standard Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
