My build is heavily optimized for Three of a Kind with:\n- The Trio (x3 mult)\n- Zany Joker (polychrome, +12 mult then x1.5)\n- Hanging Chad (retriggers first card 2 additional times)\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin (retriggers face cards)\n\nCard Sharp ($6) would be excellent since I play Three of a Kind multiple times per round, giving me x3 mult on subsequent plays. But I'm at max capacity (6/6), so I'd need to sell a joker. My core pieces—Zany Joker, The Trio, Abstract Joker, and Hanging Chad—are essential to the build. Acrobat provides the final hand multiplier, while Sock and Buskin synergizes with face cards. I need to evaluate whether adding Card Sharp's multiplier outweighs keeping one of my current jokers.\n\nSelling Sock and Buskin ($3) would give me $12 total, enough for Card Sharp ($6) with $6 remaining. The trade-off is losing the face card retriggering effect against gaining x3 mult on my second Three of a Kind play. Since my strategy relies heavily on repeated Three of a Kind hands, the multiplier boost from Card Sharp seems more impactful than the occasional face card synergy.\n\nHowever, I should question whether I need to spend at all. With $9 and a strong Three of a Kind foundation already in place, I could skip purchases entirely and save for post-boss opportunities. A Celestial pack might level up my hand further, but the immediate x3 mult multiplier from Card Sharp on subsequent plays feels more directly useful for the upcoming boss blind. including Venus.\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack seems like the strongest play—spending $6 for five planet options means I'm guaranteed to hit Venus with Telescope, pushing Three of a Kind to Level 4 and significantly boosting my chip generation before facing the boss. Card Sharp could be useful if I had more joker slots available, but leveling my primary hand feels more reliable right now.\n\nActually, let me reconsider Card Sharp more carefully. If I'm at 6/6 jokers and want it, I'd need to sell one. Card Sharp triggers x3 mult whenever I play a hand type I've already played that round—so my second and third Three of a Kinds would each get tripled. With my current setup of Abstract Joker, Zany Joker, and The Trio all stacking multiplicatively, that x3 could compound significantly on repeated hands.\n\nLet me compare: selling Abstract Joker means losing +18 mult but gaining Card Sharp's x3 on hands 2+. My first Three of a Kind drops from 166.5 to 85.5 mult, but subsequent plays jump to 256.5 and then 769.5 on the final hand—substantially higher than the 499.5 I'd get without Card Sharp. The trade-off seems worth it for the scaling on later hands, though I'm still weighing whether the early hand loss is acceptable.\n\nActually, I think the safer approach is to skip the swap entirely and just grab a Celestial pack instead. Leveling up Three of a Kind further feels more reliable than banking on Card Sharp's multiplier on future hands. I'll go with the Jumbo Celestial Pack for $6.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
