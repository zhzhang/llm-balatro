{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- Boss Blind: \"First hand is drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Hand:**\nAll 7 cards are face down (Unknown). This is the boss effect - the first hand is drawn face down.\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand (this is my 4th hand, so not final yet)\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince all cards are face down, I cannot see what I have. I have two options:\n1. Discard some/all cards to draw new cards that I can see\n2. Play cards blindly\n\nGiven that I can't see the cards, the smart move is to discard cards to draw new ones that I can see. This will allow me to make informed decisions about what to play.\n\nI should discard all 7 cards? Actually, I can only discard up to 5 cards at a time. So I should discard 5 cards to get 5 new cards I can see.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again - I have 7 cards in hand but can only discard up to 5 at a time. After discarding 5, I'll draw 5 new cards and still have 2 face-down cards remaining, plus the 5 new ones I can see.\n\n\nThe boss effect only applies to the initial draw, so once I discard and draw new cards, those should be visible. I'll discard the maximum 5 cards to get visible replacements, leaving me with 2 face-down cards and 5 I can actually see. If needed, I can discard those remaining 2 face-down cards on my next turn.\n\nI'll discard from positions 1 through 5.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
