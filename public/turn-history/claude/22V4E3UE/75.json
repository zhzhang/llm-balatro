{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Money:** $15\n**Failed Action:** I tried to buy_and_use_consumable at position 2 (The Hierophant), but it failed because \"Cannot use consumable at position 2\"\n\nLooking at the shop cards:\n1. Uranus (Planet) - $3\n2. The Hierophant (Tarot) - $3\n\nThe reason the action failed is that The Hierophant requires target cards - it \"Enhances 2 selected cards to Bonus Cards\". So I cannot use `buy_and_use_consumable` for it since that command explicitly states \"Cannot do this if the consumable requires target hand cards.\"\n\n**Available Options:**\n1. Buy The Hierophant normally (buy_card 2) for $3, then use it later\n2. Buy Uranus (buy_and_use_consumable 1) for $3 - this doesn't require targets\n3. Buy Jumbo Standard Pack for $6\n4. Buy Tarot Merchant voucher for $10\n5. Reroll shop for $7\n6. Go to round select\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy current joker setup is strong but I have one open slot (5/6 jokers). The shop doesn't have any jokers available right now.\n\nLooking at my hand levels and play history:\n- Four of a Kind (Level 4): My strongest hand, 7,052 chips\n- Flush (Level 2): Second strongest, 4,896 chips\n- Three of a Kind (Level 1): Played 5 times, my most-played hand\n\nSince I have the Telescope voucher, Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for my most played poker hand, which is Three of a Kind.\n\n**Option 1: Buy The Hierophant ($3)**\n- Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n- Would leave me with $12\n- Could be useful but requires selecting cards wisely\n\n\n- Not immediately usable in shop\n\n**Option 2: Buy Uranus ($3)**\n- Levels up Two Pair, which I've only played twice and doesn't fit my core strategy\n\n**Option 3: Buy Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)**\n- Adds a random card but less impactful than finding a joker, leaving $9\n\n**Option 4: Buy Tarot Merchant ($10)**\n- Expensive long-term investment that would drop me to just $5\n\n**Option 5: Reroll shop ($7)**\n- Costs $7 to see different cards, leaving $8 to spend\n- Could reveal a joker for my empty slot or better consumables\n- Next reroll would cost $8\n\n**Option 6: Round Select**\n- Preserve all $15 for later rounds\n- Skip any immediate improvements\n\nWith an empty joker slot and Four of a Kind and Three of a Kind as my strongest hands, I'm weighing whether to hunt for a joker through rerolling, grab The Hierophant for a +60 chip boost across two cards, or bank my money. The Hierophant's value is substantial—adding 30 chips to each of two cards compounds meaningfully when they're scored.\n\nI need to buy it first with buy_card 2, which adds it to my consumables. Then I can deploy it strategically during the round. Spending $3 on The Hierophant leaves me $12 to work with, giving me flexibility for another reroll if an opportunity arises. This feels like the right call.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
