{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in a STANDARD_PACK phase where I need to choose one of three cards:\n\n1. 7 of Spades - +7 chips (basic card)\n2. Ace of Spades - +11 chips (basic card)\n3. 2 of Clubs - +2 chips, Gold Card enhancement ($3 if held in hand at end of round, creates Planet card for final played poker hand if held in hand)\n\nLet me analyze which card would be best for my build:\n\n**My current strategy:**\n- I'm focused on Three of a Kind hands\n- I have Hanging Chad which retriggers the first played card 2 additional times\n- I have Sock and Buskin which retriggers all played face cards\n- I have Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind with Polychrome X1.5)\n- I have The Trio (X3 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n- I have Abstract Joker (+18 Mult)\n- I have Acrobat (X3 Mult on final hand)\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nOption 1: 7 of Spades\n- A 7 can help form Three of a Kind\n- +7 chips is decent\n- If played as the first card with Hanging Chad, it would retrigger 2 additional times, adding +7 chips each time for +21 chips total\n- This is okay but not exceptional\n\nOption 2: Ace of Spades\n- An Ace is a face card (wait, no - in poker Ace is not typically considered a face card, face cards are Jack, Queen, King)\n- Actually, looking at standard poker terminology, Ace is NOT a face card\n- +11 chips is good\n- If played as the first card with Hanging Chad, it would retrigger 2 additional times for +33 chips total\n- Aces can help form pairs and Three of a Kinds\n\n\n- This is solid\n\nOption 3: 2 of Clubs - Gold Card\n- Gold Card enhancement: $3 if held in hand at end of round, creates Planet card for final played poker hand if held in hand\n- This is particularly compelling because it generates $3 passively each round while also creating a Planet card that levels up my Three of a Kind, providing both immediate economic value and long-term scaling through increased base chips and mult\n- The tradeoff is the weak +2 chip contribution when played\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Gold Card's dual benefit of passive income and hand leveling seems more valuable than the straightforward chip gains from the other options, especially given my Three of a Kind focus.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
