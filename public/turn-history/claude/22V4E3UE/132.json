{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades - DEBUFFED (scores no chips, all abilities disabled)\n2. 10 of Spades - DEBUFFED (scores no chips, all abilities disabled)\n3. 5 of Hearts - +5 chips\n4. Jack of Clubs - +10 chips\n5. King of Diamonds - +10 chips\n6. 9 of Diamonds - +9 chips\n7. 5 of Diamonds - +5 chips\n\n**Goal:** Need 22,000 chips\n**Remaining:** 4 hands, 2 discards\n\n**What I have:**\n- A pair of 5s (5 of Hearts and 5 of Diamonds)\n- A pair of Jacks (but one is debuffed, so this doesn't count as a pair)\n- Two debuffed Spades\n\n**Deck remaining:**\n- 5s: 2 more cards\n- Jacks: 2 more cards\n- Kings: 3 more cards\n\nMy strategy is to get a Three of a Kind to leverage my jokers:\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n- Abstract Joker: +18 Mult\n- Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n- The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n- Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\nI currently have a pair of 5s. I need to:\n1. Discard the debuffed Spades and other cards that don't help\n2. Try to draw into a third 5 or another three of a kind\n\nWith only 2 discards left, I need to be strategic. Let me discard the two debuffed Spades and maybe some other cards to try to draw into a third 5 or build another three of a kind.\n\n\nI should focus on the pair of 5s I already have—there are still 2 more in the deck. If I discard the debuffed Spades and the 9 of Diamonds, I can draw into a third 5, third Jack, or third King to complete a three of a kind.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,6]"}
