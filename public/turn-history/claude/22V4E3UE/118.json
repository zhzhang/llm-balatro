{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $0\n- Facing Big Blind: Need 16,500 chips, reward $4\n- Upcoming Boss Blind: Need 22,000 chips, reward $5, \"All Spade cards are debuffed\"\n- Skip tag: Double Tag (gives a copy of the next selected tag)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5) - effectively +18 mult when Three of a Kind is played\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (with 6 jokers)\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand + 1 Joker slot, Negative edition\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\n- Three of a Kind scored 7,290 chips recently in Small Blind\n\nLet me calculate what I can expect from a Three of a Kind hand now:\n\nBase: 50 chips, 5 mult\n\nWith my jokers:\n- Abstract Joker: +18 mult\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult, then x1.5 from Polychrome\n- The Trio: x3 mult\n\nIf I play three face cards as Three of a Kind:\n- Base chips: 50 chips\n- Each face card adds 10 chips (assuming they score): 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80 chips\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin retriggering all face cards means each one scores again, doubling their contribution\n- Hanging Chad adds 2 extra triggers to the first card, so it scores 3 times total instead of once\n\nPlaying three Kings as Three of a Kind would give me: 50 base chips, plus the first King scoring 3 times (30 chips), the second and third Kings each scoring twice from Sock and Buskin (40 chips combined).\n\nThat totals 120 chips. For multiplier, I'm stacking Abstract Joker (+18), Zany Joker (+12), Polychrome (×1.5), and The Trio (×3), which multiplies out to 157.5. So 120 × 157.5 = 18,900 chips—well above the 16,500 threshold.\n\nSkipping would give me Double Tag, copying the next tag, but I have no money to use it and I need to win this round to progress.","action":"\"play_round\""}
