{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (just beat the Big Blind)\n- Currently in SHOP phase\n- Money: $11\n- Joker: Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. The Lovers (Tarot) - $3 - Enhances 1 card into Wild Card\n2. Sock and Buskin (Joker) - $6 - Retriggers all played face cards (Uncommon)\n3. Jumbo Buffoon Pack (Booster) - $6 - Choose 1 of 4 Joker cards\n4. Jumbo Celestial Pack (Booster) - $6 - Choose 1 of 5 Planet cards\n5. Hieroglyph (Voucher) - $10 - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance, I've been successfully playing Three of a Kind and Full House hands with the Zany Joker. The Full House just scored 1,344 chips, which is very strong.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\n1. **The Lovers ($3)** - Turning a card into a Wild Card could help me make more hands, but it's not a huge game-changer right now.\n\n2. **Sock and Buskin ($6)** - This retriggers face cards. This could be very powerful! If I play face cards, they would score twice. Combined with Zany Joker, this could be strong. Face cards are Jacks, Queens, and Kings. Since I've been making Three of a Kinds and Full Houses, and I just made a Full House with three Kings, this could be valuable. Each King would score twice (10 chips each, so 20 total), and any face card effects would trigger twice.\n\n\n3. **Jumbo Buffoon Pack ($6)** - A second joker could open up new synergies and give me more scoring potential alongside Zany Joker. Getting to pick from 4 options increases my chances of finding something useful.\n\n4. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)** - Leveling up Three of a Kind or Full House through planet cards would directly boost the hands I'm already winning with.\n\n5. **Hieroglyph ($10)** - Reducing the ante makes blinds easier, but losing a hand per round is a significant trade-off that could hurt my flexibility.\n\nLooking at what I can afford with $11, the Jumbo Buffoon Pack stands out as the strongest choice. Getting a second joker that synergizes with Zany Joker would give me more consistent scoring and better scaling through the remaining rounds. The Jumbo Celestial Pack is solid too for leveling my strongest hands, but the joker synergy feels more impactful right now.\n\nSock and Buskin is tempting since I'll be playing face cards, and retriggering them would significantly boost my chip output. However, early in a run like this, having flexibility to find the right joker feels more valuable than a guaranteed effect. The Jumbo Buffoon Pack lets me pick from four options and choose what actually fits my strategy best.\n\nBut Sock and Buskin is uncommon—harder to find later. And the math is compelling: three Kings would score 60 chips instead of 30 with the retrigger effect. That kind of consistent value across most strong hands makes it worth locking in now rather than gambling on what the Buffoon Pack offers.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
