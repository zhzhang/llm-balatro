{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $33\n- Just won the Boss Blind with a Flush scoring 4,896 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (for 5 jokers)\n5. Turtle Bean - +4 hand size (reduces by 1 every round)\n\n**Shop Items:**\nCards:\n1. Sly Joker - +50 Chips if played hand contains a Pair ($3)\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips per hand with exactly 4 cards ($4)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - Choose 1 of 2 Spectral cards ($4)\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently ($10)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my hand levels and recent plays:\n- Flush (Level 2): Played 2 times, most recently for 4,896 chips\n- Three of a Kind (Level 1): Played 5 times\n- Four of a Kind (Level 4): Played 1 time, scored 7,052 chips\n\nMy current joker setup is heavily oriented toward:\n- Spades (Wrathful Joker)\n- Face cards (Sock and Buskin)\n- Three of a Kind (Zany Joker)\n- General mult (Abstract Joker)\n\n**Evaluating Shop Options:**\n\n\nSly Joker doesn't fit my strategy since I haven't touched Pair hands and my setup favors stronger combinations. Square Joker is similarly weak—4 chips for exactly 4 cards is too niche and low-value. Spectral Pack could introduce powerful effects like card conversion or joker modification, making it worth the $4 investment. Jumbo Standard Pack offers flexibility to find cards that synergize with my current setup, though it costs more.\n\nI'm at the midpoint of the game now, and chip requirements are climbing steeply. My recent hands show a clear pattern: Four of a Kind generated 7,052 chips while Three of a Kind only managed 1,881, indicating my deck scales best with higher-ranked hands. Turtle Bean's bonus is diminishing—it's already down to +4 hand size and loses 1 each round, so I need to capitalize on it soon before it becomes negligible.\n\nThe shop offerings are underwhelming. Both jokers available are lackluster, though the Spectral Pack presents an intriguing possibility with its potential for powerful effects like card duplication or enhancement, though it carries unpredictable downsides. With $33 available and the game at a critical juncture, rerolling the shop for $5 seems like the strongest move, leaving me $28 to work with and hopefully revealing better upgrade options. Tarot cards can provide meaningful boosts to my deck over the course of the game, but spending $10 feels steep when I could use that money for direct upgrades. Rerolling the shop for $5 seems like the smarter move—I'll get a fresh look at what's available without overcommitting resources.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
