{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $21\n- I have 4 jokers (max capacity is 5)\n- No consumables (max 2 allowed)\n\n**Recent Actions:**\n- I successfully sold Business Card (was in position 4) and got $2, bringing my money from $19 to $21\n- Abstract Joker is now in position 4 (was position 5), and now gives +12 Mult instead of +15 Mult (because I went from 5 jokers to 4)\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\n1. Turtle Bean (Uncommon Joker) - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round - Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +12 Mult constant (was +15 when I had 5 jokers)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe only thing left in the shop is Turtle Bean, which is FREE and provides +5 hand size.\n\n**Why Turtle Bean is valuable:**\n- +5 hand size is extremely powerful - it gives me 13 cards instead of 8\n- More cards means more options for forming hands\n- Even though it degrades by 1 each round, it will still provide value for multiple rounds\n- It's FREE, so there's no cost to acquire it\n\n**Current Capacity:**\n- I have 4/5 jokers, so I have room to buy Turtle Bean without selling anything\n\n**Decision:**\nI should buy Turtle Bean (position 1) since it's free and I have space for it.\n\nAfter buying Turtle Bean, I'll have:\n\n\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (will go back up to +15 when I have 5 jokers)\n5. Turtle Bean - +5 hand size\n\nThis creates a solid joker lineup with the hand size boost helping me form better hands. Once I acquire Turtle Bean, there's nothing else to purchase, so I'll move forward to the next round.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
