{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $9\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots full)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (none currently)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Owned Vouchers:**\n- Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for your most played poker hand\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\nCards:\n1. The Hanged Man (Tarot) - Destroys up to 2 selected cards ($3)\n2. Marble Joker - Adds one Stone card to deck when Blind is selected, +50 Chips no rank or suit ($6)\n\nBoosters: None\nVouchers: None\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) - Most played (4 times)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3 (120 chips, 13 mult)\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just used The Chariot to enhance a card into a Steel Card (x1.5 Mult while it stays in hand). This is a great permanent boost to my mult.\n\nNow I'm back in the shop with $9 remaining.\n\nOptions:\n1. The Hanged Man ($3) - Destroys up to 2 selected cards. Could thin my deck.\n\n\n2. Marble Joker ($6) - Adds one Stone card to deck when Blind is selected. But I have no joker slots available.\n3. Reroll shop ($5) - Look for better options\n\nThe Marble Joker is tempting for its chip boost, but I'd need to sacrifice one of my current jokers. Zany Joker drives my Three of a Kind strategy, Sock and Buskin multiplies face cards, and Wrathful Joker scales with spades. Business Card generates money, which is less critical right now. The real question is whether a Stone card's passive chip generation outweighs losing one of these active effects.\n\nStone cards give +50 chips but can't form hand types themselves—they're pure chip value without interfering with my hand composition. With Ante 3 approaching and my Three of a Kind still at Level 1, I need to weigh whether that extra chip value justifies the joker slot trade-off.\n\nThe Hanged Man could thin my deck for consistency, but with only $9 and needing flexibility for future rounds, I'm better off banking my money and letting interest build. I'll proceed to the next round and reassess with a larger budget.\n\nSteel gives me a solid x1.5 mult multiplier when in play, so my joker lineup is strong enough to carry through the round. I'll earn more money from interest and leftover hands, then have better purchasing power at the next shop phase.","action":"\"round_select\""}
