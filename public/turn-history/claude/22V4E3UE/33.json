{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (choosing from a Celestial Pack)\n- Current Money: $16\n- Next blind is the Boss Blind requiring 1600 chips\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**Pack Choices:**\n1. Uranus - Level up Two Pair (+1 Mult, +20 chips) → Would be 21 chips base, 3 mult base\n2. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult, +15 chips) → Would be 11 chips base, 3 mult base\n3. Saturn - Level up Straight (+3 Mult, +30 chips) → Would be 31 chips base, 7 mult base\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3, Base Chips 120, Base Mult 13\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3\n- Two Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2\n- Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 10, Base Mult 2\n- Straight: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 4\n- Full House: Level 1, Base Chips 40, Base Mult 4\n- Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4\n\n**Boss Strategy:**\nI need to pick ONE hand type to play for the entire boss round. \n\nThe restriction forces me to commit to a single hand type that can reliably hit 1600+ chips. Four of a Kind is my strongest option at Level 3, but none of these planets upgrade it. Three of a Kind offers the best synergy with Zany Joker's +12 mult bonus and is easier to construct than Four of a Kind. Two Pair could be upgraded via Uranus, though it starts from a weaker foundation.\n\nI'm also considering Pair with Mercury and Straight with Saturn as alternatives. The key constraint is choosing one hand I can consistently produce while meeting the chip threshold. Let me evaluate Three of a Kind more carefully: my base multiplier sits at 30 (3 base + 12 from Zany + 15 from Abstract), and Wrathful Joker with Sock and Buskin adds another 18 mult through its card triggers.\n\nWith three spade face cards providing 30 bonus chips on top of the hand's 30 base, I'm looking at 60 chips × 48 multiplier = 2,880 chips—well above what I need. Two Pair doesn't work as effectively since Zany Joker won't trigger without three of a kind, and the hand generates fewer chips overall. Pair with Mercury would give me a lower base, making it harder to reach the threshold.\n\nThe real constraint I'm facing is that the boss forces me to commit to a single hand type for the entire run. Four of a Kind is already leveled up and produces massive scores, but it's difficult to assemble consistently. Three of a Kind is much more achievable and still delivers strong results with my current setup.\n\nNone of these planet options directly upgrade either of my primary hands, so I'm essentially choosing the least harmful option. Mercury boosts Pair, but that only applies when I'm specifically scoring a Pair—not when Three of a Kind or Four of a Kind contains a pair. The game only upgrades the exact hand type played, not the component hands within it. Since I'm forced to pick something, I need to evaluate which planet creates the least interference with my strategy going forward.","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
