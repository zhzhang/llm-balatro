{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Money:** $5\n**Ante:** 4/8 (halfway through the run)\n**Game Step:** SHOP\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers: 5/6 (one slot empty)\n  1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n  2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n  3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n  4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (would be +18 with 6th joker)\n  5. Acrobat (Negative) - X3 Mult on final hand + +1 Joker slot\n\n- Consumables: 1/2\n  1. The Hierophant - Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Death (Tarot) - $3 - Converts one card into another\n2. Ride the Bus (Joker) - $6 - Gains +1 Mult per consecutive hand without face cards (currently +0)\n3. Jumbo Standard Pack - $6\n4. Tarot Merchant (Voucher) - $10\n5. Reroll - $8 (but I only have $5)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $5 after the reroll. The shop now shows:\n- Death tarot for $3\n- Ride the Bus joker for $6 (I can't afford this)\n- Jumbo Standard Pack for $6 (can't afford)\n- Tarot Merchant for $10 (can't afford)\n- Next reroll would be $8 (can't afford)\n\nMy only affordable option is Death for $3, which would leave me with $2.\n\nHowever, looking at my joker setup and playstyle:\n- I primarily play Three of a Kind (played 5 times) and Four of a Kind\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin retriggers face cards, and Wrathful Joker scales with spades\n\nRide the Bus would actually work against my strategy since I'm constantly playing face cards to leverage Sock and Buskin's retrigger effect. The joker would reset its multiplier every time I use a face card, making it incompatible with my current build. Death could help me reshape my deck or duplicate valuable cards, especially since The Hierophant is already boosting specific cards. With only $5 available, Death is my only realistic purchase option.\n\nThe real question is whether Death justifies spending $3 when I'm already halfway through the run with a functional joker setup. Since I'll have The Hierophant enhancing cards anyway, Death might feel redundant rather than essential. I need to weigh whether the flexibility of converting cards now outweighs keeping $5 for future rounds.\n\nLooking at my strongest hands—Four of a Kind at Level 4 and Flush at Level 2—I'd benefit most from duplicating cards of matching ranks. Death could facilitate that, but I'm not certain it's the critical piece right now. Saving the money gives me more options down the line, so I'll pass and move forward with what I have.","action":"\"round_select\""}
