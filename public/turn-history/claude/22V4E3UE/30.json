{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $7\n- Big Blind requires 1200 chips\n- If I skip, I get D6 Tag (Rerolls in next shop start at $0)\n- Boss Blind requires 1600 chips and restricts to playing only 1 hand type\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. Death - Convert one card into another\n\n**Scoring Analysis:**\n\nLet me calculate if I can beat the Big Blind (1200 chips):\n\nFor Three of a Kind with 3 spade face cards:\n- Base: 30 chips, 3 mult\n- 3 face cards add: 30 chips (10 each)\n- Total chips: 60\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult\n- Abstract Joker: +15 mult\n- Current mult: 3 + 12 + 15 = 30 mult\n- Wrathful Joker: Each spade face card gives +3 mult when scored\n- With Sock and Buskin retriggering, each face card triggers twice\n- So 3 cards × 2 triggers × 3 mult = 18 mult\n- Final mult: 30 + 18 = 48 mult\n- Total: 60 × 48 = 2,880 chips\n\nThis easily beats 1200 chips.\n\nFor Four of a Kind (Level 3) with 4 spade face cards:\n\n\n- Base: 120 chips, 13 mult\n- 4 face cards add: 40 chips\n- Total chips: 160\n- Zany Joker applies: +12 mult\n- Abstract Joker: +15 mult\n- Current mult: 13 + 12 + 15 = 40 mult\n- Wrathful Joker with retriggering: 4 cards × 2 triggers × 3 mult = 24 mult\n- Final mult: 40 + 24 = 64 mult\n- Total: 160 × 64 = 10,240 chips\n\nFour of a Kind significantly outperforms Three of a Kind, yielding over 10,000 chips compared to 2,880. The Big Blind is easily beatable with either hand, but Four of a Kind provides a much stronger score.\n\nSkipping isn't worth it. The D6 Tag offers free rerolls next shop, but I'm already generating $4 from this blind plus my current $7 gives me $11 total. Since boss blinds can't be skipped anyway, I need to play at least one more blind regardless. My scoring power is already solid, so the immediate cash and remaining hand opportunities outweigh the potential value of extra rerolls. If I skip, I go straight to the Boss without another shop, but I'd get the D6 Tag. If I play the Big Blind, I earn $4, get interest and Business Card money, then shop again before facing the Boss. Since I can comfortably beat this blind and the extra cash with another shopping opportunity is more valuable than the D6 Tag right now, I should play the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
