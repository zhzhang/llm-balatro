{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $14\n- I just upgraded Four of a Kind to Level 3 (120 chips + 13 mult)\n\n**Inventory:**\n- 4 Jokers (1 slot available):\n  1. Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n  2. Sock and Buskin (Retrigger face cards)\n  3. Wrathful Joker (+3 Mult per spade)\n  4. Business Card (Money from face cards)\n- 0 Consumables (2 slots available)\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Abstract Joker - +3 Mult per Joker (Currently +12 Mult) - Cost: $4\n2. Death Tarot - Convert one card into another - Cost: $3\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack - $6\nVouchers:\n1. Crystal Ball - +1 consumable slot - $10\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed, Reward $4\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed, Reward $5, Boss: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nMy deck is built around playing face card combinations, particularly Three of a Kind. I just upgraded Four of a Kind to Level 3, which gives me a stronger hand option that still triggers Zany Joker (since Four of a Kind contains Three of a Kind).\n\nLet me evaluate my options:\n\n1. **Abstract Joker ($4)** - Would give +15 Mult total with 5 jokers\n   - This is a consistent multiplier boost across all hands\n   - With my current setup, this would be very valuable\n   - I'd have 5 jokers total, making it +15 mult permanently\n\n\n2. **Death Tarot ($3)** - One-time card conversion that could help assemble Four of a Kind more reliably, though less impactful than a permanent joker. 3. **Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)** - Adding more cards to the deck seems less critical since I already have solid face card coverage. 4. **Crystal Ball ($10)** - Too expensive for the current situation. 5. **Reroll ($5)** - Could reveal better options, but Abstract Joker is already a strong pick.\n\nIf I grab Abstract Joker for $4, I'm left with $10 and 5 jokers total. Let me work through the math on a Three of a Kind with three spade face cards: the base hand scores 30 chips plus 3 mult, the three cards add 30 chips for 60 total, Zany Joker pushes it to 15 mult, then Abstract Joker doubles that to 30 mult. Since Sock and Buskin trigger each card twice, and Wrathful Joker grants +3 mult per spade face card trigger, that's 6 mult per card or 18 mult across all three, bringing the final multiplier to 48.\n\nA Four of a Kind hand (Level 3) with four spade face cards performs significantly better. Starting with 120 chips and 13 mult, adding 40 chips from the cards gives 160 base chips. Zany Joker contributes 12 mult for a total of 25, Abstract Joker adds another 15 to reach 40 mult, and the four face cards with double triggers from Sock and Buskin generate 24 additional mult from Wrathful Joker, reaching 64 mult total. This yields 10,240 chips—a massive jump in scoring potential.\n\nAbstract Joker is clearly the priority purchase at $4, leaving $10 to work with. Death Tarot ($3) could help consolidate cards into matching sets, while a Reroll ($5) would reveal new shop options. Given the Boss Blind's restriction to play only one hand type, consistency matters more than flexibility. I should secure Abstract Joker first, then decide whether Death's card conversion or a fresh shop reroll better supports a Four of a Kind strategy.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
