{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Boss Blind: -1 Hand Size\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $21\n\n**My Hand (12 cards due to Turtle Bean +5 and Boss -1):**\n1. Ace of Spades - +11 chips\n2. King of Spades - +10 chips, X1.5 Mult while in hand (Steel Card)\n3. Queen of Spades - +10 chips\n4. 10 of Spades - +10 chips\n5. 3 of Spades - +3 chips\n6. 2 of Spades - +2 chips\n7. King of Hearts - +10 chips\n8. 10 of Hearts - +10 chips\n9. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n10. 2 of Hearts - +2 chips\n11. 5 of Clubs - +5 chips\n12. 3 of Clubs - +3 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult\n5. Turtle Bean - +5 hand size (already applied)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLooking at my hand, I have:\n- 6 Spades: Ace, King, Queen, 10, 3, 2\n- 4 Hearts: King, 10, 7, 2\n- 2 Clubs: 5, 3\n\n\n- Face cards available: King of Spades (Steel), Queen of Spades, King of Hearts\n- Pairs I can make: Two Kings, Two 10s, Two 3s, Two 2s\n\n**Best Hand Options:**\n\nA Flush with all 6 spades would give me 50 base chips plus 6 multiplier from the Level 2 Flush, then add the card values (Ace 11 + King 10 + Queen 10 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 46 chips) for a total of 96 chips.\n\nFor multiplier, I'm getting 6 from the flush itself, then Wrathful Joker adds 3 per spade (18 total), and Abstract Joker contributes 15, bringing me to 39 mult. The King and Queen both retrigger via Sock and Buskin, each adding 10 chips and 3 mult since they're spades, pushing my chip total to 116 and mult to 45.\n\nBut I need to reconsider the Steel King—it only provides the x1.5 multiplier if it stays in hand, which means I can't actually play it. Let me explore other hand types instead, like a pair of Kings or three of a kind, to see if those yield better results.\n\nLooking at my available options, a Flush with Spades seems promising. Playing Ace, King, Queen, 10, and 3 of Spades gives me a Level 2 Flush with 50 base chips and 6 multiplier. The card values add up to 94 chips total, and my Wrathful Joker contributes +3 per spade scored, while Sock and Buskin retriggers the face cards and Abstract Joker adds another +15 to the multiplier.\n\nWhen scoring left to right, the King and Queen each trigger twice due to the retrigger effect, giving me 6 multiplier each instead of 3. Combined with the other spades and my joker bonuses, I reach 63 total multiplier after factoring in the Steel King's x1.5 boost from staying in hand. That gives me 5,922 chips overall.\n\nThis should comfortably exceed the 4000 threshold. Let me double-check my positioning though—the Steel King needs to remain unplayed in position 2 while I score positions 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. When cards retrigger from Sock and Buskin, they apply all their effects again, so the face cards gain both their chip values and Wrathful multiplier bonuses twice. The King contributes 20 chips total and 6 multiplier, while the Queen does the same.\n\nTallying everything: 114 chips from the hand (50 base plus 11 from Ace, 20 from King, 20 from Queen, 10 from the 10, and 3 from the 3), and 21 multiplier from Wrathful across all five cards, plus 15 from Abstract, bringing the total multiplier to 42 before applying Steel King's boost.\n\nWith Steel King active at 1.5x, the multiplier becomes 63. This gives a final score of 7,182 chips—well above the 4,000 threshold needed. The optimal play is positions 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Ace, Queen, 10, 3, and 2 of Spades), leaving the Steel King in hand to apply its multiplier boost.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,5,6]"}
