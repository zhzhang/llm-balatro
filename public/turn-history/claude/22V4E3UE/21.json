{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n- Wrathful Joker: Played cards with Spade suit give +3 Mult when scored\n- Business Card: Played face cards have a 1 in 2 chance to give $2 when scored\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 4, so 1 slot available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 0, so 2 slots available)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Turtle Bean - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round. Cost: $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Crystal Ball - +1 consumable slot. Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith only $2, I cannot afford:\n- Turtle Bean ($6)\n- Crystal Ball ($10)\n- Reroll ($5)\n\nMy options are:\n1. Round Select - Move on to the next blind with $2 (no interest earned since I need $5 for $1 interest)\n\nSince I've already built a strong joker lineup with good synergies (face cards + Three of a Kind strategy), and I have no money to make any purchases, the best option is to proceed to round select.\n\nMy current strategy is solid:\n- Play Three of a Kind or Four of a Kind hands with face cards\n- Zany Joker gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin retriggers face cards\n- Wrathful Joker gives +3 Mult per Spade (doubled for Spade face cards)\n\n\n- Business Card generates money from face cards\n\nI should move forward to blind selection and start earning money from rounds. The Business Card will help generate income during play, and I'll work toward accumulating enough cash for future purchases. The correct action is to use round_select to proceed.","action":"\"round_select\""}
