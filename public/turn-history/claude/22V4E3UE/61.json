{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $19\n- I have 5 jokers (at max capacity)\n- No consumables (max 2 allowed)\n\n**What just happened:**\n- I successfully bought and used Mars (Planet card) to level up Four of a Kind from Level 3 to Level 4 (now 150 chips, 16 mult)\n\n**Current Shop Inventory (all FREE!):**\n1. Turtle Bean (Uncommon Joker) - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round - Cost: $0\n\n**Booster Packs:**\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - Cost: $0\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards (weakest joker)\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe remaining free items are:\n1. **Turtle Bean** - +5 hand size (degrades by 1 each round)\n   - This is VERY powerful! Having more cards in hand gives many more options\n   - However, I'm at max joker capacity (5/5), so I need to sell one first\n   - Business Card is clearly my weakest joker - it only generates money, not chips/mult\n   - The hand size increase from Turtle Bean is extremely valuable, especially since it starts at +5\n\n2. **Standard Pack** - Add a playing card to deck\n   - Could get another face card or useful card\n   - FREE, so worth buying\n\n**Best Strategy:**\n1. Buy the Standard Pack (booster) first - it's free and doesn't require selling anything\n\n\n2. Sell Business Card (position 4) - it's my weakest joker\n3. Buy Turtle Bean (position 1) - the +5 hand size is incredibly valuable\n\nI'll grab the Standard Pack first since it's free and straightforward.\n\nCommand: buy_booster 1","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
