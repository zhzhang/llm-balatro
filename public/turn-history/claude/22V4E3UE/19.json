{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK phase where I need to choose one of two jokers:\n\n1. Wrathful Joker - Played cards with Spade suit give +3 Mult when scored. (Common)\n2. Odd Todd - Played cards with odd rank give +31 Chips when scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3). (Common)\n\nMy current strategy:\n- I have Zany Joker (+12 Mult for hands containing Three of a Kind)\n- I have Sock and Buskin (retrigger all played face cards)\n- I'm focusing on Three of a Kind and Four of a Kind hands with face cards\n- Four of a Kind is now Level 2 with Base Chips 90, Base Mult 10\n\nLet me analyze both jokers:\n\n**Wrathful Joker (+3 Mult per Spade played):**\n- This is suit-dependent, so I'd need Spade cards to benefit\n- Only 1/4 of my deck is Spades on average\n- If I play 5 cards and 3 are Spades, that's +9 Mult\n- Not very reliable since it depends on drawing specific suits\n- Doesn't synergize particularly well with my face card strategy\n\n**Odd Todd (+31 Chips per odd rank card played):**\n- Odd ranks: A, 9, 7, 5, 3\n- That's 5 out of 13 ranks, so roughly 38% of the deck\n- Face cards (J, Q, K) are even ranks (11, 12, 13 in some systems, but typically J=11, Q=12, K=13)\n- Wait, let me reconsider: A=1 (odd), 2=even, 3=odd, 4=even, 5=odd, 6=even, 7=odd, 8=even, 9=odd, 10=even, J=11 (odd), Q=12 (even), K=13 (odd)\n\n\n- The description explicitly lists (A, 9, 7, 5, 3) as the odd ranks, so face cards don't count toward this effect. Since my whole strategy revolves around playing face cards with Sock and Buskin, Odd Todd wouldn't help much. Wrathful Joker also falls short since I'm not building around suits specifically.\n\nComparing the two: Wrathful Joker gives +3 Mult per Spade in a hand, likely yielding +3 to +6 Mult total. Odd Todd offers +31 Chips per odd-ranked card—if I play three odd cards, that's +93 Chips. The key difference is that Chips add to the base before multiplication, while Mult multiplies everything. With my Three of a Kind setup and current Zany Joker giving 3x Mult, I need to evaluate which effect scales better with my existing multipliers.\n\nThe critical factor is Sock and Buskin retriggering face cards. If I play face cards, they score twice, meaning each card's base chips double and any triggered effects activate twice. This makes Wrathful Joker particularly valuable since it would trigger twice per Spade face card, effectively doubling its Mult bonus.\n\nPlaying three Spade face cards with this setup yields +6 Mult per card (the initial +3 from Wrathful Joker plus another +3 on the retrigger), totaling +18 Mult. Odd Todd would force me to abandon the face card strategy entirely to benefit from odd-rank cards, losing the retrigger advantage that makes my current approach work. Wrathful Joker aligns perfectly with what I'm already doing, while Odd Todd would require a complete pivot away from my existing synergies.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
