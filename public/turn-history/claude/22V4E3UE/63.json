{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $19\n- I have 5 jokers (at max capacity)\n- No consumables (max 2 allowed)\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\n1. Turtle Bean (Uncommon Joker) - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round - Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards (weakest joker)\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Recent Actions:**\n- I just successfully:\n  1. Bought and used Mars to level up Four of a Kind to Level 4\n  2. Bought a Standard Pack and selected the 6 of Spades Wild Card (which creates Planet cards)\n\n**What's Left to Do:**\nThe only thing remaining in the shop is the **Turtle Bean** joker, which costs $0 (FREE).\n\n**Analysis of Turtle Bean:**\n- +5 hand size is EXTREMELY powerful\n- It degrades by 1 each round, but even at +1 hand size it's still useful\n- Having more cards in hand gives many more options for forming hands\n- This is a very strong joker\n\n**The Problem:**\n- I'm at max joker capacity (5/5)\n- To buy Turtle Bean, I need to sell one of my current jokers\n- Business Card is clearly my weakest joker - it only generates money ($2 per face card, 50% chance), not chips/mult\n- I already have $19, so money generation is less critical than chip/mult generation\n\n\n- Business Card needs to go. Selling it frees up space for Turtle Bean, which provides far more value through hand size expansion than the occasional money generation I'd lose.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
