{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 14\n- Boss Blind requiring 22,000 chips\n- Boss effect: All Spade cards are debuffed\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 10 of Hearts - +10 chips\n2. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n3. 5 of Hearts - +5 chips\n4. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips\n5. 6 of Diamonds - +6 chips\n6. 5 of Diamonds - +5 chips\n7. Stone Card - +50 chips, no rank or suit\n\n**Analysis:**\nI have two 5s (5 of Hearts and 5 of Diamonds), which makes a pair. The Stone Card has no rank or suit, so it can't participate in forming poker hands.\n\nI need to find a Three of a Kind to maximize my joker synergies. Let me see what I can do:\n- Pair of 5s\n- Three Hearts (10, 7, 5) - could make a flush if I get more hearts\n\n**Deck Analysis:**\nRemaining in deck:\n- 5s: 2 more cards (I have 2, so 2 left)\n- 6s: 4 cards\n- 7s: 3 cards\n- 8s: 2 cards\n- 10s: 3 cards\n\nI need to discard and try to get a third 5, or get three of another rank. Let me discard the cards that don't help me:\n- Keep: 5 of Hearts, 5 of Diamonds (my pair)\n- Discard: 10 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, 6 of Diamonds, Stone Card\n\nWait, let me reconsider. \n\nWith two 5s already in hand and two more available in the deck, pursuing a three of a kind seems viable. I could also draw into other ranks—there are three 10s, three 7s, four 6s, and two 8s remaining. My best strategy is to hold onto the pair of 5s and discard the rest, giving myself the best chance to hit a third 5 or pivot to another three of a kind if the draws don't cooperate.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,7]"}
