{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $1\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. Small Blind: 11,000 chips needed, $3 reward, skip tag: Handy Tag ($1 per played hand = $17)\n2. Big Blind: 16,500 chips needed, $4 reward, skip tag: Double Tag\n3. Boss Blind: 22,000 chips needed, $5 reward, Boss effect: All Spade cards are debuffed\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n1. **Can I beat the Small Blind?**\n   - Need 11,000 chips\n   - My Three of a Kind setup is very strong:\n     - Base: 30 chips + 3 mult (Level 1)\n     - Zany Joker: +12 mult with Polychrome X1.5 = +18 mult\n     - The Trio: X3 mult\n     - Abstract Joker: +18 mult\n     - Acrobat: X3 mult on final hand\n     - Hanging Chad: Retriggers first card 2 additional times\n   \n   Let me calculate a typical Three of a Kind hand:\n   - Say I play three Kings (face cards, so retriggered by Sock and Buskin)\n   - The first King triggers three times via Hanging Chad: 30 chips, while the second and third Kings each trigger twice: 20 chips each, totaling 100 chips from the three cards. Multiplier-wise, I'm stacking Zany's +18, The Trio's X3, Abstract's +18, and Acrobat's X3 on the final hand, which compounds significantly. Handy Tag would give $17 immediately since I've played 17 hands, which is substantial given my current $1. But I should evaluate whether my current setup can reliably beat the Small Blind first. The Boss Blind's Spade debuff is concerning, though my new Gold Card 2 of Clubs generates $3 per round and creates Planet cards. Skipping means gaining $17 but losing the $3 reward and potential interest, while playing gives me the reward plus interest if I finish with $5+, plus the $3 from the Gold Card.\n\nMy Three of a Kind jokers are strong enough to beat this blind, so playing makes more sense—I get the money, maintain momentum for leveling, and can shop. Skipping would stall my progression toward Ante 8.","action":"\"play_round\""}
