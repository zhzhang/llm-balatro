{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in a PLANET_PACK selection phase\n- I bought a Celestial Pack for $4, leaving me with $14\n- I need to choose 1 of 3 planet cards:\n  1. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult and +15 chips)\n  2. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush (+4 Mult and +40 chips)\n  3. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n\n**My Strategy:**\nMy deck is built around Three of a Kind with face cards, specifically:\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retriggers face cards\n- Wrathful Joker: +3 Mult per spade\n- Business Card: Money from face cards\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Just scored 1,890 chips on Three of a Kind\n- Upcoming Big Blind needs 1200 chips\n- Boss Blind needs 1600 chips with restriction \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**Analysis of Planet Choices:**\n\n1. **Mercury (Pair)** - Would upgrade Pair from Level 1 to Level 2\n   - Currently: 10 chips + 2 mult\n   - After: 25 chips + 3 mult\n   - This is a backup hand type I haven't used yet (0 times played)\n   - Could be useful if I can't make Three of a Kind\n\n2. **Neptune (Straight Flush)** - Would upgrade Straight Flush\n   - Currently: 100 chips + 8 mult\n   - After: 140 chips + 12 mult\n   - I've never played this hand type (0 times played)\n   - Very hard to make, requires 5 sequential cards of same suit\n\n3. **Mars (Four of a Kind)** - Already at Level 2!\n   - Currently: 90 chips + 10 mult\n   - After: 120 chips + 13 mult\n   - I've never played this hand type (0 times played)\n   - This is a stronger hand than Three of a Kind\n\n**Key Insight:**\nMars stands out because Four of a Kind would still trigger my Zany Joker—since Three of a Kind is technically contained within Four of a Kind. Leveling it to Level 3 gives me a more powerful option while maintaining my core synergy.\n\nLooking at the containment rule more carefully: Four of a Kind definitely qualifies as containing Three of a Kind, so I'd get both the upgraded base stats and the +12 mult from Zany. My other jokers would continue working as well. Mercury feels redundant since I'm already reliably hitting Three of a Kind, whereas Mars pushes me toward a genuinely stronger hand that preserves my existing combo. of a Kind gives better base stats than Three of a Kind, jumping from 90 chips + 10 mult to 120 chips + 13 mult at the next level. It still triggers Zany Joker's bonus and keeps my other synergies intact with Sock and Buskin for face cards and Wrathful for spades. Mercury would work but I'm already hitting Three of a Kind reliably, and Neptune's too inconsistent to build around.\n\nI'm going with Mars.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
