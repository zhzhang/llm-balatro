{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in Ante 6/8, Round 14\n- I'm in the SHOP phase\n- Current money: $8\n- I just used Venus to level up Three of a Kind to Level 5 (110 chips, 11 mult)\n\n**My Joker Setup:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (for 6 jokers)\n3. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Riff-raff: Creates 2 Common Jokers when Blind selected - $6\n2. Business Card: Face cards have 1/2 chance to give $2 when scored - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Spectral Pack - $6\n2. Standard Pack - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Hone: Foil/Holographic/Polychrome appear 2x more often - $10\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\nI'm going into Ante 6, which means the chip requirements are going to be significantly higher. Let me think about what I need:\n\n1. My build is heavily focused on Three of a Kind, which is now Level 5 (110 chips, 11 mult)\n2. My last Three of a Kind scored 45,441 chips\n3. I have 6 jokers at max capacity\n\nWith $8, my options are:\n- Riff-raff for $6 - but I'm at max jokers, so I'd need to sell jokers first\n\n\n- Business Card for $4 - adds some money generation\n- Standard Pack for $4 - could add enhanced cards to my deck\n- Jumbo Spectral Pack for $6 - spectral cards can be powerful but risky\n- Reroll for $5 - to see if better options appear\n\nThe key constraint is my joker capacity. Riff-raff would create 2 Common Jokers when the Blind is selected, but since I'm already at 6/6, I'd need to sacrifice existing jokers to make room. Business Card could provide steady income through face card scoring, while the Standard Pack might offer useful card enhancements. A reroll could reveal better options, though it costs $5 and leaves limited funds. Spectral cards offer powerful effects like adding editions to jokers or transforming my deck, though they carry some risk of being destructive. The reroll could find better options but seems unnecessary given my strong joker setup and limited space. Between the Jumbo Spectral Pack, Standard Pack, and saving for later rounds, the Spectral Pack stands out as the most impactful—it could meaningfully upgrade my jokers with editions or reshape my deck composition in ways that directly strengthen my Three of a Kind strategy heading into Ante 6. est and most strategic move is to buy the Jumbo Spectral Pack for $6. The edition upgrades alone—getting Polychrome, Holographic, or Foil on my remaining jokers—would substantially increase my scoring potential. I'll go with that purchase.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
