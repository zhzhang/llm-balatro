{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (choosing from a celestial pack)\n- Current Money: $23\n- I have 5 jokers (max capacity)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Saturn - Level up Straight (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n2. Uranus - Level up Two Pair (+1 Mult and +20 chips)  \n3. Jupiter - Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips)\n\n**My Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) - Played 4 times\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3 (120 chips, 13 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Flush: Level 1 (35 chips, 4 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Straight: Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult) - Never played\n- Full House: Level 1 (40 chips, 4 mult) - Played 1 time\n\n**Recent Played Hands:**\n- Four of a Kind - 7,052 chips (most recent)\n- Flush - 1,995 chips\n- Three of a Kind - 1,890 chips (played 3 times recently)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n \nLooking at what's available, Saturn doesn't make sense since I haven't used Straight yet. Uranus is weak given my limited Two Pair usage. Jupiter seems most viable—I've already scored nearly 2,000 chips with Flush, and boosting it further would strengthen a hand I'm actively playing. my current joker setup doesn't synergize well with Two Pair since Zany Joker won't help. Straights are harder to form than flushes and I haven't played them yet, so they're not worth prioritizing. Flush stands out as the practical choice—it's a hand I've already succeeded with, flushes come up frequently enough, and it gives me a reliable fallback when Three of a Kind and Four of a Kind aren't available. The stat increases are solid too. I'll go with position 3.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
