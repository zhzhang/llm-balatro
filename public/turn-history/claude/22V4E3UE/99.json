Ace of Hearts - +11 chips\\n4. Jack of Hearts - +10 chips\\n5. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\\n6. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\\n7. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips\\n\\n**Hand Analysis:**\\n- I have a PAIR of 9s (positions 5 and 6)\\n- I have 2 Spades (10\\u2660, 8\\u2660) and 2 Clubs (9\\u2663, 6\\u2663) - not enough for a flush\\n- I have potential for a straight: 10-9-8-7-6 but I'm missing the 7\\n- Face cards: Jack of Hearts, Ace of Hearts\\n\\n**My Jokers:**\\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)\\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active)\\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand (4 hands remaining, so not final yet)\\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\\n\\nI have 0 discards left, so I must play a hand now. My build is optimized for Three of a Kind, but I only have a pair of 9s. \\n\\nPlaying the pair of 9s with both face cards gives me a solid foundation. The 9\\u2665 and 9\\u2663 contribute 18 chips to the pair, while the J\\u2665 and A\\u2665 will be retriggered by Sock and Buskin, multiplying their value. Abstract Joker adds a flat 18 mult, and Wrathful Joker contributes 6 mult from the two spades I'd include.\\n\\nHowever, I need to verify the scoring rules\\u2014only cards that are part of the highest hand actually count their chip values. If the J\\u2665 and A\\u2665 aren't part of the pair itself, they won't contribute chips unless they're being scored separately through the retrigger mechanic. to-right)\\\". Only cards that score as part of the hand trigger their chip values. Face cards outside the scoring hand don't contribute chips, though they might activate \\\"when played\\\" effects.\\n\\nLet me reconsider the best possible hand. A Pair of 9s gives me 10 base chips plus 9 chips from each 9, totaling 28 chips. With a base multiplier of 2 and the Abstract Joker adding 18 mult, I get 28 \\u00d7 20 = 560 chips\\u2014far short of 10,000. I should explore whether a straight is possible with my cards.\\n\\nFor a 10-9-8-7-6 straight, I'd need all five ranks, but I'm missing the 7. The Wrathful Joker triggers when Spades are scored, not just played, so they must be part of the hand itself. If I include Spades like 10\\u2660 and 8\\u2660 in a scoring hand with the 9s, I'd gain additional multipliers from the Wrathful Joker, though this still seems insufficient to reach the target.\\n\\nWithout three of a kind available, my strongest option is playing a pair. I'm reconsidering whether the Sock and Buskin joker\\u2014which retriggersface cards\\u2014would activate twice if I include a Jack and Ace alongside the pair, even if they don't directly contribute chips. Based on earlier calculations showing three 9s with a Jack yielding over 11,000 chips, there might be value in that approach, but I need to settle on my best available play. \\u2665, 9\\u2663, J\\u2665, A\\u2665)\\n\\nEstimated chips: 560 from this hand. With 4 hands left and needing 10,000 total, I'd need roughly 9,440 more chips across the remaining hands\\u2014that's a steep climb without drawing significantly better cards. Since I have no discards remaining, I can't improve what I'm holding. Playing the pair of 9s with the face cards is my best option here.\\nCommand: play 5 6 3 4 pair 560\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 98]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

Queen of Clubs - +10 chips\\n7. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips\\n\\n**Hand Analysis:**\\nThis is amazing! I have:\\n- A STRAIGHT FLUSH: 10\\u2660-9\\u2660-8\\u2660-7\\u2660-6\\u2660 would be a straight flush, but I don't have 6\\u2660, I have 6\\u2665\\n- A STRAIGHT: 10-9-8-7-6 (positions 1,2,3,4,5)\\n- A FLUSH: 10\\u2660-9\\u2660-8\\u2660-7\\u2660 (4 spades, need 5 for flush)\\n- A PAIR of 6s (positions 5 and 7)\\n\\nWait, let me recheck. I have 10\\u2660, 9\\u2660, 8\\u2660, 7\\u2660 which are 4 spades, and then 6\\u2665, Q\\u2663, 6\\u2663. \\n\\nSo I can make:\\n- A STRAIGHT: 10-9-8-7-6 using positions 1,2,3,4,5 (10\\u2660, 9\\u2660, 8\\u2660, 7\\u2660, 6\\u2665)\\n\\n\\n- A PAIR of 6s: using positions 5,7 (6\\u2665, 6\\u2663)\\n\\nThe straight is clearly superior. For the straight hand, I get 30 base chips plus 40 from the card values (10+9+8+7+6), totaling 70 chips. The multiplier starts at 4 for a Level 1 straight, then the Wrathful Joker adds 12 mult from the four spades scored, and the Abstract Joker provides additional mult\\n\\n. With all bonuses combined, I reach 34 total multiplier, giving me 2,380 chips on this hand alone. Adding my current 588 chips brings me to 2,968 total.\\n\\nI still need 7,032 more chips across my remaining 2 hands to hit 10,000. Let me compare what the pair of 6s would yield instead\\u2014it starts with just 10 base chips and 12 from the card values. 2,380 \\u00d7 3 = 7,140 chips, which combined with 588 would give me 7,728 chips - still short.\\n\\nI need to think strategically about what cards remain in the deck. There's one more 9 available, two more 6s, and several face cards that could retrigger my effects. Since I don't have discards left to search for better combinations, playing the straight now makes sense - I can hope to hit a three of a kind in my remaining hands to activate Zany Joker and The Trio.\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 5 straight 2380\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 99]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

Jack of Diamonds - +10 chips\\n\\n**Hand Analysis:**\\n- I have a PAIR of Aces (positions 1 and 6)\\n- I have a PAIR of Jacks (positions 3 and 7)\\n- I have TWO PAIR (Aces and Jacks)\\n- I have 4 Clubs (Q\\u2663, J\\u2663, 6\\u2663, 3\\u2663) - not enough for flush\\n- I have 3 face cards: Q\\u2663, J\\u2663, J\\u2666\\n\\n**My Jokers:**\\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)\\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active)\\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand (2 hands remaining, so not final yet)\\n\\n\\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\\n\\nI should hold Acrobat for the final hand since I have two hands left. Playing Two Pair with my Aces and Jacks (positions 1, 6, 3, 7) gives me 20 base chips plus 42 card chips, multiplied by my active jokers. The Wrathful Joker adds 3 Mult for the Ace of Spades, while Sock and Buskin retrigggers my three face cards for additional scoring. (A\\u2660) + 11 (A\\u2666) + 10 + 10 (J\\u2663 twice) + 10 + 10 (J\\u2666 twice) = 82 chips total.\\n\\nThe multiplier comes to 2 + 3 + 18 = 23. Multiplying these gives 82 \\u00d7 23 = 1,886 chips for this hand. Combined with my previous score, that puts me at 5,414 chips\\u2014still 4,586 short of the goal. I need to think strategically about my final hand and whether Acrobat's X3 multiplier could bridge that gap. Playing Q\\u2663 alongside the jacks would create a pair instead, which changes the hand ranking. With Acrobat's X3 multiplier on my final hand, even a modest setup with around 25 mult and 60 chips would yield 4,500 chips. Playing this Two Pair now gets me 1,886, leaving 4,586 needed\\u2014which breaks down to roughly 61 chips required before the Acrobat multiplier kicks in. That's definitely within reach with a solid final hand.\\n\\nI'll go ahead and play the Two Pair using all four cards. But I'm wondering if adding Q\\u2663 as a fifth card makes sense, since it wouldn't contribute to the Two Pair scoring itself but could potentially retrigger Sock and Buskin as a face card. Looking at the rules though, cards outside the highest hand don't trigger any effects or add chips, so Q\\u2663 would be dead weight. I'm sticking with just the four-card Two Pair.\\nCommand: play 1 3 6 7 two pair 1886\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- Boss Blind: \"First hand is drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 5,619\n- Remaining hands: 1 (THIS IS MY FINAL HAND!)\n- Remaining discards: 0\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**I need:** 10,000 - 5,619 = 4,381 more chips with just 1 hand remaining.\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. King of Spades - +10 chips, X1.5 Mult while this card stays in hand (Steel Card enhancement)\n2. 3 of Spades - +3 chips\n3. 3 of Hearts - +3 chips\n4. Queen of Clubs - +10 chips\n5. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips\n6. 3 of Clubs - +3 chips\n7. King of Diamonds - +10 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a THREE OF A KIND of 3s (positions 2, 3, 6)\n- I have a PAIR of Kings (positions 1 and 7)\n- I have a FULL HOUSE (three 3s and two Kings)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand (THIS IS THE FINAL HAND!)\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\nThis is critical! I have Acrobat which gives X3 Mult on my final hand, and this IS my final hand!\n\n\nNow I need to evaluate what hand to play. Playing the full house with the three 3s and two Kings gives me 69 base chips plus multipliers from Abstract Joker (+18), Wrathful Joker (spades give +3 each), Zany Joker (+12 for the three of a kind with Polychrome), and The Trio (X3 for three of a kind), all multiplied by Acrobat's X3 on this final hand. Zany Joker's Polychrome adds X1.5: 40 × 1.5 = 60 mult. The Trio multiplies by 3: 60 × 3 = 180 mult. Then Acrobat triples it again: 180 × 3 = 540 mult. Final score is 69 × 540 = 37,260 chips.\n\nAlternatively, I could just play the three 3s as a Three of a Kind instead. That gives 30 base chips plus 9 from the cards themselves for 39 total chips, with a base mult of 3 before applying Zany Joker's bonus.\n\nCompleting the calculation for this second option: the mult becomes 36 after accounting for Zany Joker (12), Abstract Joker (18), and Wrathful Joker (3). Applying Polychrome brings it to 54 mult, The Trio pushes it to 162, and Acrobat takes it to 486. This yields 39 × 486 = 18,954 chips.\n\nHowever, I'm realizing the King of Spades grants X1.5 mult while staying in hand, so I need to factor that into the second option's calculation.\n\nWith the King remaining unplayed, the multiplier chain becomes: 36 × 1.5 (King) × 1.5 (Polychrome) × 3 (The Trio) × 3 (Acrobat) = 729 mult, giving 39 × 729 = 28,431 chips. The Full House path also delivers 37,260 chips. Both far exceed what I need, so I'll go with the Full House to push the score higher.\n\nLet me verify the Full House scoring: 40 base chips plus 29 from the cards (three 3s and two Kings) equals 69 chips. The multiplier stacks to 40 from the base, Zany's bonus for containing three of a kind, Abstract, and Wrathful covering both spade cards. Applying Polychrome and the other multipliers gives me the winning total."
