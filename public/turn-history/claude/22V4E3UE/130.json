{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 14\n- Boss Blind requiring 22,000 chips\n- Boss effect: All Spade cards are debuffed\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades - DEBUFFED\n2. 9 of Spades - DEBUFFED\n3. 8 of Spades - DEBUFFED\n4. 2 of Spades - DEBUFFED\n5. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n6. 5 of Diamonds - +5 chips\n7. Stone Card - +50 chips, no rank or suit\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult\n3. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n**Analysis:**\nMy hand has 4 debuffed Spades that cannot score. I have:\n- 7 of Hearts\n- 5 of Diamonds\n- Stone Card (no rank/suit)\n\nThis is a terrible hand. I cannot form a Three of a Kind with these cards since they're all different ranks. The Stone Card has no rank, so it can't participate in forming poker hands.\n\nMy best option here is to discard all the Spades and the cards I can't use to try to get better cards. I should keep discarding until I can form a Three of a Kind from non-Spade cards.\n\nSince I have 4 discards available, I should discard the 4 Spades cards to get new cards and hopefully draw into a Three of a Kind.\n\n\nI'll discard positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 to remove all the Spades and draw fresh cards that might help me build toward a Three of a Kind.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4]"}
