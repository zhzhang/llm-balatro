{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 6/8, Round 14\n- In BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Money: $2\n- Have Investment Tag (will give $25 after beating Boss Blind)\n\n**My Joker Setup:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (for 6 jokers)\n3. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip tag: Polychrome Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n2. Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss effect: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\" (1 in 7 cards are drawn face down/debuffed)\n\n**Previous Performance:**\n- My last Three of a Kind scored 45,441 chips (Ante 5, Boss)\n- That's more than enough for both Big Blind (30,000) and Boss Blind (40,000)\n- I also scored 16,965 and 13,466 chips on previous Three of a Kind hands\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nShould I skip Big Blind for the Polychrome Tag?\n\n**Polychrome Tag:**\n- Gives me a free Polychrome Joker in the shop (next base edition shop Joker)\n- Polychrome gives x1.5 mult\n- This is a very valuable tag - I already have Zany Joker with Polychrome which is crucial to my build\n\n\n- Playing through would net $4, but a free Polychrome Joker is worth significantly more than that cash reward. The x1.5 multiplier on a high-tier joker is essentially doubling its value. Skipping seems like the better long-term play since I'll get $25 from the Investment Tag after beating the Boss anyway, making the $4 less critical.\n\nI'm confident in my scoring power—I've hit 45,441 before and only need 40,000 for the Boss. The real constraint is that I'm at full joker capacity (6/6), so I'd need to make room in my deck before the Polychrome Joker appears in the shop, or I'll miss out on the reward entirely.\n\nSelling a weaker joker like Abstract Joker (just +18 mult) seems reasonable if it means securing a stronger replacement. The Polychrome Tag essentially guarantees a high-impact joker, which matters more than the $4 and Card Sharp activation I'd get from playing the Big Blind. With two antes left to go, having that extra power now helps me scale through the final rounds.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
