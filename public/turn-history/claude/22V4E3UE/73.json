{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $21\n- Max Jokers: 6 (just gained +1 from Ectoplasm adding Negative to Acrobat)\n\n**My Jokers (5/6):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (for 5 jokers)\n5. Acrobat (Negative edition) - X3 Mult on final hand + +1 Joker slot\n\n**Shop Items:**\nCards:\n1. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining ($5)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently ($10)\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. I now have 6 max joker slots but only 5 jokers - I have room for 1 more joker!\n2. Abstract Joker still shows +15 Mult (for 5 jokers), meaning if I get a 6th joker it will become +18 Mult\n3. I have $21, which is enough to buy Mystic Summit ($5), Jumbo Standard Pack ($6), Tarot Merchant ($10), or reroll ($6)\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n**Mystic Summit ($5):**\n- +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n- This is additive mult, but still decent\n- Would fill my 6th joker slot\n\n\n- If I add it, Abstract Joker scales to +18 Mult, giving a net +18 Mult boost when I exhaust my discards. The condition is restrictive though.\n\n**Jumbo Standard Pack ($6):**\n- Could add a good playing card to my deck\n- Less impactful than a joker at this stage\n\n**Tarot Merchant ($10):**\n- Long-term investment for more tarot cards\n- Could be valuable for enhancing cards\n- Leaves me with $11\n\n**Reroll Shop ($6):**\n- Could reveal better options, though current offerings are solid\n- Costs $6, leaves me with $15\n- Next reroll would cost more\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\nI'm at Ante 4/8, halfway through the game. Chip requirements will continue to scale. My hand history shows:\n- Four of a Kind (Level 4): 7,052 chips - strongest\n- Flush (Level 2): 4,896 chips\n- Three of a Kind: 1,350-1,890 chips\n\nI have an open joker slot now (5/6), which is valuable. I should consider:\n1. Buying Mystic Summit to fill that slot - it's cheap at $5 and provides conditional mult\n2. Rerolling to find a better joker option\n3. Buying Tarot Merchant for long-term scaling\n\nGiven that I'm at Ante 4/8, I need to balance immediate power with scaling potential. The open joker slot is pressing—filling it with Mystic Summit is low-risk, but rerolling could yield something stronger. Tarot Merchant offers long-term value but requires committing resources now.\n\nRerolling for $6 seems worth exploring. I might uncover a more impactful joker, additional planet cards to boost my hands, or tarot options that multiply my deck's potential. With $15 remaining after the reroll, I'd still have flexibility to purchase whatever emerges. Let me reroll and reassess.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
