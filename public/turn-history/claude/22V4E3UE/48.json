{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $9\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots full)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (none currently)\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind:** 2000 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Skip Tag: Coupon Tag (free cards and boosters in next shop)\n2. **Big Blind:** 3000 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip Tag: Foil Tag (next base edition shop joker is free and becomes Foil)\n3. **Boss Blind:** 4000 chips needed, $5 reward, -1 Hand Size\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Last played hands show I've been scoring:\n  - Four of a Kind: 7,052 chips\n  - Flush: 1,995 chips\n  - Three of a Kind: 1,890 chips\n  - Full House: 1,344 chips\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) - Most played (4 times)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3 (120 chips, 13 mult)\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need to decide whether to:\n1. Play the Small Blind (2000 chips)\n\n\n2. Skip for the Coupon Tag (free cards and boosters in next shop)\n\nThe Coupon Tag is extremely valuable - it makes initial cards and booster packs FREE in the next shop. This could save me a significant amount of money and let me upgrade my deck substantially. My recent Three of a Kind hands scored around 1,890 chips, and with my steel card providing x1.5 multiplier plus my joker bonuses (Zany's +12, Abstract's +15, Wrathful's +3 per spade), I should be able to exceed the 2000 chip threshold needed for the Small Blind. the Coupon Tag offers significant value that might outweigh skipping the Small Blind. Getting free cards and booster packs in the next shop—potentially including Celestial Packs for planet cards or tarot cards to strengthen the deck—could provide a substantial advantage heading into the Big and Boss blinds. The risk is jumping directly to 3000 chips without the Small Blind warmup, then facing 4000 chips with reduced hand size, but my current scoring potential seems solid enough to manage the jump. The free boosters could include Celestial Packs or other powerful additions that set me up better for the harder blinds ahead. - Play Small → Shop → Face Big → Shop → Face Boss\n\nIf I skip, I get one free shopping session with the Coupon Tag between Big and Boss. If I play, I get two normal shopping sessions instead. The real calculation is whether one discounted shop outweighs two paid ones plus the $3 Small Blind reward. With my current $9, I'd normally afford 1-2 purchases per round, but the Coupon Tag could unlock $12-15 worth of value through free boosters and cards. That advantage seems substantial enough to justify skipping.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
