{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Current Blind: Big (3000 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current Money: $9\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. King of Spades (Steel Card - +10 chips, X1.5 Mult while in hand)\n3. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n4. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n5. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n6. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Analysis of Current Hand:**\n\nI have:\n- Pair of Aces (Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds)\n- Pair of Kings (King of Spades Steel Card, King of Diamonds)\n- 10 of Spades\n- 3 of Spades\n- 4 of Clubs\n- 7 of Diamonds\n\nBest hands I can make:\n1. **Two Pair** (Aces and Kings)\n2. **Flush** (I have 4 spades: Ace, King, 10, 3)\n\nLet me calculate the best option:\n\n**Option 1: Flush with 4 spades (need 5 for flush, so this won't work)**\n\n\n**Option 2: Two Pair (Aces and Kings)**\n\nTo form two pair, I need to play both the Aces and Kings together. If I play Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds, King of Diamonds, and a fourth card, I get a pair of Aces worth 32 chips base. But I should consider whether playing both pairs gives me better value with my Jokers, particularly Sock and Buskin which retriggers face cards and Wrathful Joker which rewards spades.\n\n**Option 3: Playing all four face cards**\n\nIf I commit both Kings and both Aces to Two Pair, I sacrifice the Steel King's X1.5 multiplier. The hand scores 62 chips base (20 for two pair plus the card values), and with Wrathful Joker adding +3 per spade, Abstract Joker's +15 mult, and Sock and Buskin retriggering all four face cards, the multiplier compounds significantly. I need to weigh whether this setup outperforms keeping the Steel King held for its multiplier bonus. 3, King of Spades +3, and they each score twice, so +12 total. Mult comes to 2 (base) + 12 (wrathful) + 15 (abstract) = 29 mult, giving me 104 × 29 = 3,016 chips.\n\nThat exceeds 3000, but I should double-check this. Actually, Steel King requires staying in hand to get the X1.5 mult bonus—if I play it, that multiplier disappears. So I need to reconsider whether keeping it unplayed while using the other cards for Three of a Kind might work better.\n\nWith 4 spades, I can't make a Flush, so I'm weighing whether Steel King's X1.5 mult in hand outweighs playing it as part of a stronger combination. If I keep it and play a pair of Aces instead, I get 32 chips from the pair, base mult of 2, plus the Wrathful and Abstract bonuses, with Sock and Buskin retriggering the Aces for additional scoring.\n\nThat gives me 54 chips × 30 mult = 1,620 total, which falls short. Let me evaluate the Two Pair hand more carefully by playing all four cards—both Aces and both Kings. The base is 20 chips, and scoring left to right: Ace of Spades adds 11 chips and triggers Wrathful for +3 mult, then gets retriggered by Sock and Buskin. King of Spades contributes 10 chips with another Wrathful trigger and retrigger. Ace of Diamonds adds 11 chips with a retrigger, followed by King of Diamonds.\n\nThe second King adds 10 chips with a retrigger, bringing total chips to 104. Multiplier comes to 29 from the base 2, plus 12 from Wrathful activations across both spades cards, plus 15 from Abstract. That's 104 × 29 = 3,016 chips, which works. I'll go with positions 1, 2, 6, 7 for the Two Pair.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,7]"}
