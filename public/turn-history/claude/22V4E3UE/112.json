{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Current Chips: 7,290\n- Chips Needed: 11,000\n- Remaining: 3,710 chips needed\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Available Hands:**\n- Pair of Kings (King of Hearts, King of Diamonds)\n- Pair of Jacks (Jack of Hearts, Jack of Clubs)\n- Two Pair: Kings and Jacks\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5) = +18 mult when triggered (won't trigger)\n2. Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards (THIS IS KEY!)\n3. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (always active)\n4. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand (won't trigger unless this is the last hand)\n5. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind (won't trigger)\n6. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\nI have 3 hands left to get 3,710 chips. That's about 1,237 chips per hand on average.\n\nLet me think about what I can play:\n\n**Option 1: Two Pair (Kings and Jacks)**\nBase: 20 chips, 2 mult\nCards that score: King, King, Jack, Jack = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 chips\n\n\nWith Sock and Buskin retriggering all face cards, the first King gets hit by Hanging Chad for 3 total plays (10 × 3 = 30), then Sock and Buskin adds another trigger (10 more). The remaining Kings and Jacks each get doubled by Sock and Buskin's retrigger effect, giving 20 chips each for the second King, first Jack, and second Jack.\n\nAdding it up: 20 base + 40 from the first King + 20 + 20 + 20 from the others = 120 chips. The multiplier comes to 20 (2 base + 18 from Abstract), so the final score is 2,400 chips.\n\nFor a Pair of Kings instead, I'm looking at 10 base chips and 2 mult. The two Kings score 20 chips total, but with Hanging Chad triggering the first King three times (30 chips) and Sock and Buskin adding one more trigger (10 chips), that's 40 from the first King alone. The second King gets the Sock and Buskin retrigger for 20 chips.\n\nThat gives 70 chips × 20 multiplier = 1,400 chips. A Pair of Jacks would score the same. Two Pair looks strongest at 2,400, though I should double-check the math since retriggering means the entire scoring sequence repeats, not just individual card values. The order cards are played matters too when calculating how Hanging Chad and Sock and Buskin interact.\n\nIf I play King of Hearts first, it scores 10 chips initially, then Hanging Chad triggers it twice more (10 + 10), and Sock and Buskin triggers it again (10), totaling 40 chips. The King of Diamonds scores 10 chips, then Sock and Buskin triggers it once more for 20 total. Both Jacks follow the same pattern—10 chips each, then Sock and Buskin triggers them for 20 chips each.\n\nThe Jack of Clubs scores 10 chips on play, then Sock and Buskin triggers it for another 10, giving 20 chips. Adding up all four cards: 40 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 100 chips from the hand itself, plus the 20 base chips equals 120 chips. With a multiplier of 20 (2 base plus 18 from Abstract), this hand scores 2,400 chips total. That leaves me needing 1,310 chips across my final two hands.\n\nI'm considering whether to hold the Acrobat x3 for the last hand instead of using it now. If I commit this Two Pair, I'll need to generate the remaining chips efficiently with whatever cards remain.\n\nLooking at what's left in the deck—2 Kings, 1 Jack, 1 Queen, 3 tens, and 4 Aces—I can likely hit decent hands. Playing Two Pair now gets me to 2,400 chips, requiring just 655 chips per remaining hand on average, which is manageable. I'll go ahead and play the Two Pair with the Kings and Jacks from positions 2, 6, 3, and 4.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,6,3,4]"}
