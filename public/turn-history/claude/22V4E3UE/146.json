{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 6/8, Round 15\n- Boss Blind: Need 40,000 chips\n- Boss effect: 1 in 7 cards drawn face down\n- Current chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 3\n- Money: $2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 6 of Spades - Wild Card (can be any suit)\n2. 7 of Hearts\n3. 5 of Hearts\n4. 6 of Clubs\n5. 2 of Clubs\n6. 10 of Diamonds\n7. 2 of Diamonds\n\n**Joker Setup:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult\n3. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n**Analysis of current hand:**\nLooking at the cards:\n- Two 6s (6 of Spades Wild, 6 of Clubs)\n- Two 2s (2 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds)\n- 7 of Hearts\n- 5 of Hearts\n- 10 of Diamonds\n\nI have TWO PAIR! (pair of 6s and pair of 2s)\n\nHowever, my best jokers are optimized for Three of a Kind:\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind (x1.5 from polychrome)\n- The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n\n- \nWith 4 hands and 3 discards left, I should hunt for a third 6 or 2 to trigger my Three of a Kind multipliers. There are still 6 matching cards in the remaining deck, so I have reasonable odds of completing a set. Playing two pair now won't activate my strongest bonuses, so discarding to search for the third card makes more sense given my joker configuration.\n\nI'll keep the pair of 6s since the Wild card gives me additional flexibility. That means discarding the 7, 5, 2 of Clubs, 10, and 2 of Diamonds to maximize my chances of drawing another 6.\n\nActually, holding both pairs is smarter—I can discard just the 7 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, and 10 of Diamonds, then draw 3 new cards hoping for either a 6 or a 2 to complete a set.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,6]"}
