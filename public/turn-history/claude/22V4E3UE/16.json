{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $14\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 2, so 3 slots available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 0, so 2 slots available)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Business Card - Played face cards have a 1 in 2 chance to give $2 when scored. Cost: $4\n2. Turtle Bean - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round. Cost: $6\n\nBoosters:\n1. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately. Cost: $4\n2. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards. Cost: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Crystal Ball - +1 consumable slot. Cost: $10\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm now in Ante 2, which means the chip requirements will be much higher. Looking at my previous hands:\n- Three of a Kind scored 1,350 chips\n- Full House scored 1,344 chips\n\nMy strategy has been working well with Three of a Kind and face cards. The synergy between Zany Joker and Sock and Buskin is strong.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n1. **Business Card ($4)** - This gives money when face cards score. Since I'm playing a lot of face cards with Sock and Buskin, this could generate extra income. However, it's not directly increasing my scoring potential.\n\n2. **Turtle Bean ($6)** - +5 hand size is huge! It reduces by 1 every round, but even temporarily having more cards in hand means more options to form better hands. This could be very valuable.\n\n\n3. **Celestial Pack ($4)** - Since I've been relying on Three of a Kind frequently, using a Planet card to level it up would boost both its base chips and multiplier significantly.\n\n4. **Buffoon Pack ($4)** - Another joker could add more scoring power, and I have room for 3 more.\n\n5. **Crystal Ball ($10)** - Too expensive right now and I have no consumables to justify the slot.\n\n6. **Reroll ($5)** - Could explore other options.\n\nWith $14 available, I need to prioritize what gives the most value.\n\nThree of a Kind is clearly my strongest hand since I've played it repeatedly, so leveling it up with Celestial Pack feels like the right first move—it directly strengthens my most consistent scoring engine. After spending $4, I'd have $10 left, which opens up either grabbing a second joker from Buffoon Pack, increasing my hand size with Turtle Bean, or going all-in on Crystal Ball if I want to commit to consumables.\n\nThe real question is whether I want to double down on jokers or diversify. Buying both Celestial Pack and Buffoon Pack for $8 total gives me a permanently upgraded hand plus another source of mult and chips, which feels more reliable than the temporary boost from Turtle Bean. That leaves me with $6 for future flexibility.\n\nI'll go with Celestial Pack first to strengthen my core hand.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
