{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n2. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n3. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n4. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n5. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n6. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n7. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Resources:**\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 1\n- Current chips: 0\n- Chips needed: 11,000\n\n**Available Hands:**\n- Two Pair: 7s and 6s (7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 6 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs)\n- Two Pair: 7s and 2s (7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds)\n- Two Pair: 6s and 2s (6 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds)\n- Pair of 7s\n- Pair of 6s\n- Pair of 2s\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5) = +18 mult when triggered\n2. Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards (no face cards in hand currently)\n3. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult\n4. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n5. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Analysis:**\nI don't have a Three of a Kind, which is my strongest hand with the joker setup. \n\nI can form several two pairs from my current cards. Testing the 7s and 6s combination: the base two pair gives 20 chips, and with the 7 of Hearts retriggered by Hanging Chad, that's 7 × 3 = 21 chips, plus the remaining cards (7 + 6 + 6 = 19), totaling 60 chips before multipliers.\n\nWith a base multiplier of 2 and Abstract Joker adding 18, I get a 20x multiplier, resulting in 1,200 chips—still far short of the 2,750 average I need per hand. I'm facing a critical constraint: only one discard remains, which means I can swap up to 5 cards and then have exactly 4 hands left to play. The deck still holds useful cards like three 6s, one 7, three 2s, and two 9s, but my limited discards make it risky to pursue a different strategy now. a 2, so roughly 18% chance of hitting Three of a Kind this way.\n\nBut I could also discard all cards except the pair of 6s and draw 5 new cards instead. With 3 sixes remaining in the deck, drawing 5 cards gives me about a 38% probability of completing the set—significantly better odds than the single draw approach.\n\nThe 2 of Clubs is a Gold Card worth $3, but it doesn't contribute to forming Three of a Kind, so I should discard it along with the other non-pair cards. I'll keep just the 6s and draw 5 fresh cards to maximize my chances of improvement.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,6,7]"}
