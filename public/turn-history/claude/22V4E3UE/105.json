{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $1\n- Just selected the Gold Card (2 of Clubs) from the Standard Pack\n\n**Current Jokers (6/6 - at max capacity):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) - Sells for $4\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards - Sells for $3\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (3 per joker, now 6 jokers) - Sells for $2\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative - Sells for $5\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - Sells for $4\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - Sells for $2\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. To the Moon - +1 interest per $5, +10 Mult, Holo - $8 (can't afford, only have $1)\n2. Standard Pack - $4 (can't afford)\n3. Magic Trick Voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n4. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $1, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop or reroll. My options are:\n1. Proceed to round select\n2. Sell a joker to get more money to potentially buy something\n\nSince I can't afford anything, I should proceed to the round select phase. I have a strong joker setup focused on Three of a Kind hands, and I just added a Gold Card that will generate passive income and create Planet cards.\n\nThe best action here is to use the `round_select` command to move forward to the next phase.","action":"\"round_select\""}
