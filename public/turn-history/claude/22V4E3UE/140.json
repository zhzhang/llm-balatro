{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the spectral pack options and choose the best one for my Three of a Kind focused build.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Ante 6/8, in SPECTRAL_PACK phase\n- Money: $2\n- My build is heavily focused on Three of a Kind with multiple multiplicative jokers\n- I have 6 jokers at max capacity\n\nSpectral pack options:\n1. Grim - Destroy 1 random card, add 2 random Enhanced Aces\n2. Talisman - Add Gold Seal to 1 selected card (earn $3 when scored)\n3. Ectoplasm - Add Negative to random joker, -2 hand size (+1 joker slot)\n4. Sigil - Convert all cards in hand to single random suit\n\nLet me evaluate each:\n\n**Grim**: Destroys a card and adds 2 Enhanced Aces. This could be good if I need more reliable cards to form Three of a Kind. However, destroying a card randomly is risky, and I don't know what enhancement the Aces will have.\n\n**Talisman**: Adds Gold Seal to 1 card, which gives $3 when scored. This provides money generation but doesn't directly boost my scoring power. With my current low money ($2), this could help, but it's not a major upgrade.\n\n**Ectoplasm**: This is very interesting! It adds Negative to a random joker (giving +1 joker slot) BUT reduces hand size by 2. I already have Acrobat with Negative edition, which gave me +1 joker slot. Getting another Negative joker would give me another +1 joker slot, bringing me to 7 total joker slots. However, losing 2 hand size is significant - I currently have 7 cards in hand, and reducing to 5 cards would make it harder to find Three of a Kind combinations. The trade-off is: do I want another joker slot at the cost of -2 hand size?\n\n\nSigil converts my entire hand to one suit, which would enable flush scoring but conflicts with my Three of a Kind strategy. My joker lineup includes Zany, Abstract, Acrobat, The Trio, Hanging Chad, and Card Sharp—most of which are built around Three of a Kind synergies rather than flush payoffs. Adding another joker slot via Ectoplasm seems more aligned with my multiplicative approach than pivoting to a different hand type.\n\nThe real constraint is the -2 hand size penalty. While 5 cards still allows Three of a Kind formation with Hanging Chad's retriggering, I'm working with 28 remaining cards in my deck. Reducing from 7 to 5 cards significantly lowers my odds of finding matching ranks when I need them, especially as Ante 6 approaches and difficulty increases. The extra joker slot would be powerful, but the reduced hand size makes it harder to consistently execute my core strategy.\n\nGrim offers a more direct path forward—adding 2 Enhanced Aces gives me 6 total Aces in deck, making Three of a Kind with Aces nearly guaranteed. Talisman provides safety but minimal scoring benefit, Sigil doesn't support my Three of a Kind approach, and the hand size loss from Ectoplasm outweighs the joker slot advantage. Grim's ability to enhance specific cards and increase my chances of hitting the combination I need makes it the strongest choice here.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
