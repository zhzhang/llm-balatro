{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- Boss Blind: \"First hand is drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 6 of Spades - +6 chips\n2. 10 of Hearts - +10 chips\n3. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\n4. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\n5. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips\n6. 7 of Diamonds - +7 chips\n7. 2 of Diamonds - +2 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a PAIR of 9s (9♥ and 9♣)\n- I also have 10-9-8-7-6 which is a STRAIGHT\n- The straight is higher value than the pair\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (always active)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand (4th hand remaining, so not final yet)\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\nMy jokers are optimized for Three of a Kind, but I don't have that. I have:\n- A pair of 9s\n- A straight (10-9-8-7-6)\n\nLet me calculate the chips for each option:\n\n**Option 1: Play the Pair of 9s (positions 3, 4)**\n\n\nThe pair scores 28 chips before jokers (10 base + 2 mult, plus 18 from the two 9s). Only the Abstract Joker activates here, adding 18 mult for a final multiplier of 20, yielding 560 chips total.\n\nFor a straight instead, I could play 10-9-8-7-6 using positions across the hand. A Level 1 straight gives 30 base chips and 4 multiplier, with the 10 contributing additional chips.\n\nAdding the card values (10+9+8+7+6 = 40), I get 70 total chips before jokers and 4 multiplier. The Wrathful Joker triggers on the 6 for +3 multiplier, and Abstract Joker adds +18 multiplier, bringing final multiplier to 25. That yields only 1,750 chips—still far short of the goal.\n\nI should focus on finding three of a kind to unlock better joker synergies with my remaining discards and hands.\n\nLooking at what's left in the deck, the 6s have the best draw odds with 4 remaining, while the 9s have only 2 left. I'll discard the 10♥, 8♣, and 7 to maximize my chances of hitting a matching card on the next draw.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,5,6,7]"}
