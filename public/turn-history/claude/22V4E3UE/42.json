{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $27\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots full)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (no consumables currently)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\nCards:\n1. The Hanged Man (Tarot) - Destroys up to 2 selected cards ($3)\n2. Marble Joker - Adds one Stone card to deck when Blind is selected, +50 Chips no rank or suit ($6)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards ($4)\n2. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards ($4)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for your most played poker hand ($10)\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my hand levels, my most played hand is Three of a Kind (4 times), followed by Four of a Kind (1 time). I just beat the boss with a massive 7,052 chip Four of a Kind play.\n\nMy strategy should focus on:\n1. Building stronger chip-generating combinations\n2. Leveling up hands I'm likely to play\n3. Improving my joker setup\n\n**Current Joker Analysis:**\n- Zany Joker is great for Three of a Kind hands (+12 mult)\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin works well with face cards since it retriggers them\n- Wrathful Joker provides conditional bonuses based on spades\n- Business Card generates money but isn't critical for scoring\n- Abstract Joker provides steady +15 mult\n\nThe Telescope voucher ($10) would guarantee Three of a Kind planets in future Celestial Packs, which aligns with my most-played hand. A Celestial Pack ($4) could immediately level up Three of a Kind since it's only level 1, making it significantly stronger.\n\nMarble Joker adds a Stone card for +50 chips. Prioritizing the Celestial Pack seems most efficient—leveling Three of a Kind from level 1 to level 2 boosts both its chip and mult scaling. The Telescope voucher is tempting but expensive and only pays off if I purchase additional packs later. Marble Joker offers chip generation but doesn't directly strengthen my most-played hand.\n\nLooking at recent performance, Four of a Kind is already performing well at level 3, while Three of a Kind at 1,890 chips has room to grow. Leveling it would provide consistent scaling improvements across future rounds.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
