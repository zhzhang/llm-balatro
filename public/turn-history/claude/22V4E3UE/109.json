{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n3. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n5. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n6. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n7. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n\n**Goal:** Need 11,000 chips total\n**Resources:**\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 2\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Best Hand:**\nI have a pair of 6s (6 of Hearts + 6 of Clubs)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5) = effectively +18 mult when triggered\n2. Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (3 per joker × 6 jokers)\n4. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n5. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Deck Analysis:**\nLooking at what's remaining in the deck:\n- Kings: 4 cards\n- 10s: 3 cards (I have one)\n- Jacks: 3 cards\n- 8s: 2 cards\n- 5s: 4 cards\n- 9s: 3 cards\n- 6s: 3 cards (I have two)\n- 7s: 3 cards (I have one)\n- Queens: 2 cards\n- 2s: 4 cards (I have one)\n\n\n- Aces: 4 cards (I have one)\n- 4s: 2 cards\n- 3s: 1 card (I have one)\n\n**Strategy:**\nThree of a Kind would unlock significant multiplier synergies with my jokers, so I'm weighing whether to discard further with my remaining 2 discards to chase that, or play the pair of 6s now. With 4 hands left, I have some flexibility, but I need to be strategic about when to commit.\n\nThe pair of 6s would only yield 440 chips—far short of the ~2,750 average I need per hand to hit 11,000 total. Discarding again makes more sense. Among my options, the Ace has the most duplicates in the deck, making it the safest to let go of, while the 6 of Hearts is worth keeping since I already have a pair there. I'm weighing whether to hold onto the pair of 6s since drawing a third would give me trips with my jokers. With only 3 sixes remaining in the 38-card deck, I'd have roughly a 28% chance of hitting one across my 4 draws. The safer approach seems to be keeping the 6s and the 2 of Clubs for its Gold Card value, then discarding the Ace, 7, 10, and 3 to maximize my chances at completing the set.\n\nLet me work through what Three of a Kind actually scores. The base hand gives 30 chips, and three 6s contribute 18 additional chips. My Zany Joker adds 12 multiplier (18 when accounting for polychrome), The Trio triples my multiplier, and the Abstract Joker stacks another 18 multiplier on top. The Hanging Chad becomes crucial here—it retrigggers the first 6 twice more, which fundamentally changes how the scoring calculates.\n\nWhen I account for the retriggers properly, the first 6 scores three times for 18 chips, while the other two 6s score once each for 12 more chips, bringing my total to 60 chips. My multiplier builds to 39 before The Trio's x3 effect, resulting in a final multiplier of 117. That gives me 7,020 chips—more than half of what I need to win. This makes Three of a Kind my target hand.\n\nI need to discard strategically since I can only remove 4 cards from my 7-card hand. I'll get rid of the Ace of Spades, 7 of Spades, 10 of Hearts, and 3 of Clubs, keeping the pair of 6s and the 2 of Clubs to pursue the three-of-a-kind.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,6]"}
