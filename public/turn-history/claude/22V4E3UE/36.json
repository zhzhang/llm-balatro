{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 6 (Boss Blind)\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Current Money: $16\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Current Hand:**\n1: 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n2: 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3: 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4: 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n5: 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6: 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n7: 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n8: 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Pair of 4s (4 of Spades, 4 of Clubs)\n- Pair of 5s (5 of Spades, 5 of Diamonds)\n- Two Pair (4s and 5s)\n- High Card\n- No Three of a Kind available\n- No face cards available\n- Flush potential with 4 Diamonds\n\n**Analysis:**\nI need to decide which hand type to commit to for this entire boss round. Looking at my available options:\n\n1. **Two Pair** - I have 4s and 5s, which would give me:\n   - Base: 20 chips, 2 mult (level 1)\n   - Only the paired cards count: 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 18 chips\n   - Total: 38 chips with 17 mult (2 base + 15 Abstract)\n   - Zany Joker doesn't activate since there's no Three of a Kind\n   - Wrathful provides minimal value with only 2 spades in the pair\n   - This scores 646 chips, which falls short\n\nA single pair of 4s or 5s would yield around 408 chips—also insufficient. For a flush, I'd need five cards of the same suit, but I only have four diamonds available.\n\nMy current hand lacks the strength needed. I previously scored 1,890 chips with Three of a Kind, so that's my target. Since I'm locked into one hand type for the entire round once I commit, playing Two Pair now would cap me at roughly 408 chips—well below the 1,600 threshold.\n\nI need to discard strategically to build toward Three of a Kind. The remaining deck has two 4s and two 5s left, plus several 7s and three 10s still in play.\n\nI'll discard the weakest cards—8 of Spades, 10 of Diamonds, 9 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds—while keeping one pair to draw a matching third card.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,5,6,8]"}
