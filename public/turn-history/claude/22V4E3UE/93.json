{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- Boss Blind: \"First hand is drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 10 of Hearts - +10 chips\n2. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\n3. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips\n4. 7 of Diamonds - +7 chips\n5. Unknown (face down)\n6. 2 of Diamonds - +2 chips\n7. Unknown (face down)\n\n**Visible cards:**\n- 10 of Hearts\n- 9 of Clubs\n- 8 of Clubs\n- 7 of Diamonds\n- 2 of Diamonds\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, Polychrome (X1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\n**Analysis:**\nI still have 2 face-down cards (positions 5 and 7). The visible cards don't form any strong hand:\n- 10♥, 9♣, 8♣, 7♦, 2♦\n- No pairs, no three of a kind\n- Could potentially make a straight if the unknown cards help (need a 6 to complete 10-9-8-7-6, or need other cards)\n\nSince I need 10,000 chips and my build is optimized for Three of a Kind, I should discard the remaining unknown cards to see what I have. \n\nI've got 3 discards available. The visible cards show a partial straight with 10-9-8-7, so if either unknown card is a 6 or Jack, I could complete it. But since my jokers are built around Three of a Kind, I should reveal what's face down and discard the 2 of Diamonds along with the unknowns to draw fresh cards that might give me the pairs I need. d the 2 of Diamonds to draw 4 new cards, hoping to hit a Three of a Kind or better combination.\n\nI'm analyzing the remaining deck composition to see what's available: Queens (4), Aces (5), Kings (3), and 6s (5) are still in play. Since I don't have any matching pairs or strong combos with my current hand, discarding the unknowns plus low cards gives me the best shot at improving. I'll go with removing positions 5, 6, 7, and the 2♦ to draw fresh cards.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,7]"}
