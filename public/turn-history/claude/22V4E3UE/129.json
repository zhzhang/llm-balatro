{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Phase: BLIND_SELECT\n- Boss Blind requiring 22,000 chips\n- Boss Description: All Spade cards are debuffed\n- Money: $0\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Joker Setup (6/6):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers × 3)\n3. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy build is heavily focused on Three of a Kind. The boss blind debuffs all Spade cards, which means I need to avoid playing Spades in my Three of a Kind hands.\n\nLet me calculate my potential damage with Three of a Kind:\n\n**First Three of a Kind (without Card Sharp):**\n- Base: 90 chips, 9 mult\n- Abstract Joker: +18 mult → 27 mult\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult → 39 mult, then polychrome x1.5 → 58.5 mult\n- The Trio: x3 mult → 175.5 mult\n- Chips from cards: Let's say 3 cards at ~10 chips each = 30 chips → 120 total chips\n- Score: 120 × 175.5 = 21,060 chips\n\n**Second Three of a Kind (with Card Sharp):**\n- Base: 90 chips, 9 mult\n- Abstract Joker: +18 mult → 27 mult\n\n\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult → 39 mult, then polychrome x1.5 → 58.5 mult\n- The Trio: x3 mult → 175.5 mult\n- Card Sharp: x3 mult → 526.5 mult\n- Chips from cards: 120 chips\n- Score: 120 × 526.5 = 63,180 chips\n\nIf I play this as my final hand, Acrobat multiplies the entire result by 3, giving me 1,579.5 mult and a total of 189,540 chips. This comfortably exceeds the 22,000 chip requirement.","action":"\"play_round\""}
