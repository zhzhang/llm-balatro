{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK\n- Money: $3\n- Just bought a Jumbo Celestial Pack\n- I need to select one of 5 planet cards\n\n**My Jokers:**\nAll focused on Three of a Kind strategy:\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers × 3)\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind from Level 3 to Level 4 (+2 Mult and +20 chips)\n2. Mercury - Level up Pair from Level 1 to Level 2 (+1 Mult and +15 chips)\n3. Jupiter - Level up Flush from Level 2 to Level 3 (+2 Mult and +15 chips)\n4. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind from Level 4 to Level 5 (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n5. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush from Level 1 to Level 2 (+4 Mult and +40 chips)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy entire build is centered around Three of a Kind. I have:\n- Two jokers that specifically trigger on Three of a Kind (Zany Joker and The Trio, both providing multiplicative bonuses)\n- Hanging Chad that retriggers the first card\n- Sock and Buskin that retriggers face cards\n\n\n- Abstract Joker providing baseline mult and Acrobat amplifying the final hand\n\nI've already leveled Three of a Kind once with Venus, and another Venus would push it to Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult base). My recent hands show consistent Three of a Kind performance—16,965 and 13,466 chips—with 10 total plays of this hand. The Ante 5 Boss Blind is coming up and will demand substantial chip output, making the Venus upgrade critical for scaling my primary hand type.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
