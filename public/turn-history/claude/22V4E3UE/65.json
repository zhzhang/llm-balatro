{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $21\n- I have 5 jokers (at max capacity)\n- No consumables (max 2 allowed)\n\n**Owned Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (for 5 jokers)\n5. Turtle Bean - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round\n\n**Shop Info:**\n- Shop Cards: None\n- Shop Boosters: None\n- Shop Vouchers: None\n- Current Reroll Cost: $5\n- Can Reroll Boss: No\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe shop is completely empty - there are no cards, no boosters, and no vouchers to buy. I have the following options:\n\n1. **Reroll the shop** for $5 to see if there are better items\n2. **Proceed to round select** since there's nothing to buy\n\n**Should I reroll?**\n\nLet me think about my current situation:\n- I have $21\n- I have a solid joker lineup with Turtle Bean for extra hand size\n- My most played hand is Three of a Kind (5 times played)\n- I have Zany Joker which gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- I'm on Ante 3/8, so I'm still in early-mid game\n\nThings that could help:\n- Planet cards to level up Three of a Kind (currently level 1)\n- Better jokers to replace my weaker ones\n- Tarot cards to enhance my deck\n\nHowever:\n- Rerolling costs $5, which is a significant portion of my $21\n\n\n- A reroll offers no guarantee of finding something worthwhile, and my current joker composition is already functional. Since I'm near the end of this ante and have $16 remaining after a reroll, the risk-reward doesn't seem favorable enough to justify spending the money on an uncertain outcome.\n\nLooking at my scoring patterns, Four of a Kind is pulling significant weight at 7,052 chips, while my other hands are contributing steadily. The deck is performing well enough that pushing forward makes more sense than gambling on upgrades I might not find.","action":"\"round_select\""}
