{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in a Mega Arcana Pack selection phase\n- I need to choose 2 of 5 Tarot cards\n- Current hand has 8 cards (King of Spades with Steel Card enhancement, Queen of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, King of Diamonds, 8 of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds)\n\n**Available Tarot Cards:**\n1. The Hermit - Doubles money (Max of $20) - I have $19, so this would give me $20 (capped)\n2. The Sun - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Hearts\n3. The Lovers - Enhances 1 card into a Wild Card (can be used as any suit)\n4. The Tower - Enhances 1 card into a Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank or suit)\n5. The Star - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Diamonds\n\n**My Strategy:**\nLooking at my jokers:\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retriggers face cards\n- Wrathful Joker: +3 Mult per spade scored\n- Business Card: Money from face cards\n- Abstract Joker: +15 Mult constant\n\nMy main strategy has been Three of a Kind with face cards and spades being valuable.\n\n**Analysis of Tarot Cards:**\n\n1. **The Hermit** - Gives me $1 more (from $19 to $20 cap). Not very valuable since I'm already close to the cap.\n\n2. **The Sun** - Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts. I have 2 Hearts already (Queen of Hearts, 5 of Hearts). This could help with flush strategies, but I don't have strong flush synergies in my jokers.\n   \nThe Lovers stands out as particularly strong—converting a card to Wild means it triggers Wrathful Joker's spade bonus automatically while maintaining flexibility for hand formation. The Tower offers raw chip value with its +50 bonus, but loses the suit and rank interactions that power my current joker synergies. The Star would convert cards to Diamonds, giving me more options for that suit. onsidering the King of Spades more carefully—it already has Steel Card enhancement giving X1.5 Mult while in hand, so converting it would waste that benefit. I should target the Queen of Hearts or King of Diamonds with The Lovers to get both the Wild Card flexibility and Sock and Buskin's retrigger. For The Tower, the 3 of Diamonds is the obvious choice since it has minimal inherent value. I'll go with The Lovers on the Queen of Hearts first.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,2]"}
