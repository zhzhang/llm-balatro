{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big Blind\n- Chips Needed: 1200\n- Current Money: $7\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1: 7 of Hearts\n2: Ace of Diamonds\n3: King of Diamonds\n4: Jack of Diamonds\n5: 10 of Diamonds\n6: 9 of Diamonds\n7: 5 of Diamonds\n8: 3 of Diamonds\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. Death - Convert one card into another\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my hand, I have 7 diamonds (Ace, King, Jack, 10, 9, 5, 3) and 1 heart (7).\n\nPossible hands I can make:\n1. **Flush** - I have 7 diamonds, so I can play 5 of them for a flush\n2. **Straight** - I could potentially make a straight with A-K-J-10-9 (but ace high straight needs A-K-Q-J-10, so this doesn't work). Let me check... I have Ace, King, Jack, 10, 9 - that's A-K-J-10-9, which is NOT a straight. A straight needs consecutive ranks.\n   \nWait, let me reconsider straights:\n\n\n- For a straight I need 5 consecutive ranks\n- I have: Ace, King, Jack, 10, 9, 7, 5, 3\n- Possible straights: None that I can see. King-Jack-10-9 is only 4 cards, and adding Ace doesn't work since Ace-King isn't consecutive unless it's A-2-3-4-5 or 10-J-Q-K-A.\n\nSo my best option is likely a **Flush** with 5 diamonds. Let me calculate the scoring for a Flush: Base: 35 chips, 4 mult (Level 1). I'll play the five highest diamonds: Ace, King, Jack, 10, 9, which gives me 11 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 50 chips from the cards themselves, totaling 85 chips. For multipliers, I have a base of 4, plus 15 from Abstract Joker. Zany Joker won't trigger since there's no three of a kind, and Wrathful Joker doesn't apply without spades. Sock and Buskin will retrigger the face cards (King and Jack), and Business Card might generate money but won't affect the chip count. I should reconsider the exact scoring order to make sure I'm calculating this correctly. triggered (flush doesn't contain three of a kind)\n- Wrathful Joker: NOT triggered (no spades)\n- Total mult: 4 + 15 = 19 mult\n\nTotal chips: 85 × 19 = 1,615 chips\n\nThis beats the 1200 chips needed! I could use Death to convert a card, but the current flush is already strong enough. Converting the 7 of Hearts to a diamond wouldn't meaningfully improve the score since I already have sufficient diamonds for the flush. Before committing to this play, I should evaluate whether discarding to draw better cards might be worthwhile—my deck composition shows I'm light on diamonds with only 6 remaining, while clubs and spades are at full strength.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
