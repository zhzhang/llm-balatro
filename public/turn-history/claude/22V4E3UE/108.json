{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips, Wild Card - can be used as any suit)\n4. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n5. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n6. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n7. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**Goal:** Need 11,000 chips total\n\n**Resources:**\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 3\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Best Hand Available:**\nI have a pair of Queens (Queen of Spades + Queen of Hearts). The Queen of Hearts is a Wild Card, so it can match any suit.\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5) = +18 mult\n2. Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult\n4. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n5. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Analysis:**\nI still don't have a Three of a Kind, which is my strongest hand type. I have a pair of Queens. Looking at the deck, there are only 2 Queens remaining (I have 2 in hand, started with 4).\n\nMy options:\n1. Play the pair of Queens now\n2. Discard again to try for a Three of a Kind\n\nLet me calculate what a pair of Queens would give me:\n- Base: 10 chips + 2 mult (Pair Level 1)\n- Queens are face cards, so:\n  - First Queen triggers Sock and Buskin twice and Hanging Chad twice more = 3 total activations = 30 chips\n  - Second Queen triggers Sock and Buskin = 2 activations = 20 chips\n- Total chips from cards: 10 (base) + 30 + 20 = 60 chips\n- Mult: 2 (base) + 18 (Abstract) = 20 mult\n- No Three of a Kind multipliers would apply\n- Final chips: 60 × 20 = 1,200 chips\n\nThat's far short of the 11,000 needed across 4 hands—I need roughly 2,750 per hand. I should discard and try for a Three of a Kind instead. Looking at what's left in the deck: Kings (4), 10s (4), Jacks (3), 8s (2), 5s (4), 9s (3), 6s (4, one in hand), 7s (4), Queens (2, both in hand), 2s (4, one in hand), and Aces (4 remaining).\n\nThe best keeps are cards where I have realistic odds of drawing two more—the Ace of Spades and 6 of Clubs both have four copies left in the deck. The 2 of Clubs is worth keeping too since it's my Gold Card worth $3 at round's end. I should dump the Queens since only two remain, plus the 3 of Hearts, 4 of Diamonds, and other low-count cards that won't help me build a set.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,7]"}
