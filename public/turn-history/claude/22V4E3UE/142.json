{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 6/8, Round 14\n- In BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Money: $2\n- Just added 2 Enhanced Aces to my deck via Grim\n\n**My Joker Setup:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (for 6 jokers)\n3. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. Small Blind: 20,000 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Skip tag: Investment Tag (gain $25 after defeating Boss Blind)\n2. Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip tag: Polychrome Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n3. Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss effect: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\" (This means 1 in 7 cards are drawn face down, which is debuffed)\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\n- My last Three of a Kind scored 45,441 chips (Ante 5, Boss)\n- That's more than enough for the Small Blind (20,000) and Big Blind (30,000)\n- Boss Blind needs 40,000 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me think about skipping vs playing:\n\n**Small Blind (20,000 chips):**\n- I can easily beat this with my setup\n- Reward: $3\n\n\n- Skip tag: Investment Tag ($25 after beating Boss)\n\nThe Investment Tag is tempting—$25 is substantial money. But skipping means losing the $3 immediate payout and missing a chance to activate Card Sharp's X3 multiplier if I replay a hand type. The net gain from skipping is only $22 after accounting for the lost $3 reward, and I'd forfeit the opportunity to build momentum with another scoring round.\n\nHowever, the Boss Blind's face-down card mechanic isn't particularly threatening to my Three of a Kind strategy since those cards simply won't contribute to scoring. Given my current $2 bankroll is critically low and the Investment Tag would give me $25 to spend after beating the Boss, the shopping power seems worth the trade-off. I'm confident I can handle all three blinds based on my previous scoring, so I'll skip the Small Blind. ipping the Small Blind nets me $36 compared to $14 if I play it—a $22 difference that significantly improves my purchasing power. I'm skipping it.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
