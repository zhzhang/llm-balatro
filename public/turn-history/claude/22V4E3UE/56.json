{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $19\n- I have 5 jokers (max capacity)\n- No consumables\n- I just beat the Big Blind\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\n1. Turtle Bean (Uncommon) - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round - Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n2. Mars (Planet) - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips - Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n\n**Booster Packs:**\n1. Mega Arcana Pack - Choose 2 of up to 5 Tarot cards - Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n2. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n\n**Analysis:**\nAll items in the shop are FREE! This is because I had the Coupon Tag from earlier. This is an amazing opportunity.\n\nLet me consider what to get:\n\n1. **Turtle Bean** - This gives +5 hand size initially, but reduces by 1 every round. This could be very powerful for drawing better hands, but it degrades over time. Still, even a few rounds of +5 hand size could be game-changing.\n\n2. **Mars** - This levels up Four of a Kind. I already have Four of a Kind at Level 3 (Base Chips 120, Base Mult 13). Mars would bring it to Level 6 with even more chips and mult. However, I've only played Four of a Kind once, and my most played hand is Three of a Kind (5 times).\n\n3. **Mega Arcana Pack** - Tarot cards can enhance playing cards, which could be very powerful. I could get cards that add multipliers, chips, or other effects.\n\n4. **Standard Pack** - This adds playing cards to my deck. \n\nAdding more cards to my deck could help me assemble better hand combinations more consistently. My current joker synergies lean heavily toward Three of a Kind plays, face card triggers, and spade scoring, so I need to think about whether these free items actually support my existing strategy or if they'd push me in a different direction.\n\nThe Turtle Bean stands out as genuinely powerful—five extra hand size for multiple rounds means drawing significantly more cards per turn, which dramatically improves my chances of hitting the specific hands my jokers reward. Mars feels like a weak fit since I'm not building toward Four of a Kind. The Mega Arcana Pack could add tarot cards that enhance individual cards with multipliers or other modifiers, while a Standard Pack would simply expand my deck with more cards to work with.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
