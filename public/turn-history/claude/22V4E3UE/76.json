{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- I'm in the SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $12\n- I have 5/6 jokers (one slot empty)\n- I just purchased The Hierophant and it's now in my consumables\n\n**Inventory:**\nJokers (5/6):\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (will be +18 if I get a 6th joker)\n5. Acrobat (Negative) - X3 Mult on final hand + +1 Joker slot\n\nConsumables (1/2):\n1. The Hierophant - Enhances 2 selected cards to Bonus Cards (+30 extra chips)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Uranus (Planet): $3 - Levels up Two Pair\n- Jumbo Standard Pack: $6 - Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards\n- Tarot Merchant (Voucher): $10 - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently\n- Reroll: $7\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy strongest hands are:\n1. Four of a Kind (Level 4) - 7,052 chips\n2. Flush (Level 2) - 4,896 chips\n3. Three of a Kind (Level 1) - Most played (5 times)\n\nKey considerations:\n1. I have an empty joker slot - filling this would be valuable\n2. I have The Hierophant ready to use, which will add +60 chips total to 2 cards\n3. Current money: $12\n\nOptions:\n1. **Reroll ($7)** - Try to find a joker for my empty slot, leaves me with $5\n\n\n2. **Buy Tarot Merchant ($10)** - Increases tarot frequency for future rounds, leaves me with $2\n3. **Buy Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)** - Adds a card to my deck, leaves me with $6\n4. **Round Select** - Keep my $12 and The Hierophant for the next round\n\nThe core decision is whether to spend now trying to fill that joker slot through a reroll, invest in the Tarot Merchant for long-term value, or preserve my resources and move forward with what I have.\n\nI'm halfway through the run at Ante 4/8, and my current joker collection is already performing well. The Hierophant will give me a solid chip boost next round. A $7 reroll is expensive relative to what I might find—if I don't hit something worthwhile, I'm left with just $5, which severely limits my options. Holding onto the full $12 gives me flexibility for better opportunities ahead. I'll skip the reroll and proceed to the next round.\n\nWait—I should think about this differently. My Abstract Joker gains +3 Mult for each joker I have, so filling that empty slot would push it from +15 to +18 Mult alone. That's a meaningful scaling boost, and whatever new joker I add on top of that could be significant. The risk of spending $7 and finding nothing decent is real, but the potential payoff of landing a strong sixth joker justifies the gamble here.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
