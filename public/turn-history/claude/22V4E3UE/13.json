{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (Boss Blind phase)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $5\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Boss Effect: All Heart cards are debuffed\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at the Boss Blind selection. The boss debuffs all Heart cards, which means any Heart cards I play will have their abilities and chip values disabled. However, importantly, debuffed cards STILL participate in forming hand types - they just don't contribute chips or trigger effects.\n\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- Full House scored 1,344 chips (way over the 600 requirement)\n- I've been successfully playing Three of a Kind and Full House hands\n- My jokers work well together: Zany gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind (and Full House contains Three of a Kind), and Sock and Buskin retriggers face cards\n\nThe boss debuff on Hearts is concerning, but let me think about this:\n1. Debuffed cards still form hand types\n2. I have a strong scoring engine with my two jokers\n3. The requirement is only 600 chips\n\nFrom the previous turn, I had this hand:\n1. King of Spades\n2. 7 of Spades  \n3. King of Hearts (will be debuffed)\n4. 9 of Hearts (will be debuffed)\n5. 2 of Clubs\n6. King of Diamonds\n7. Jack of Diamonds\n8. 7 of Diamonds\n\nIf I avoid Hearts, I still have:\n- King of Spades, King of Diamonds (2 Kings)\n- 7 of Spades, 7 of Diamonds (2 Sevens)\n\n\n- Jack of Diamonds\n- 2 of Clubs\n\nThat's not enough for a Three of a Kind with just non-Heart cards. But with 35 cards remaining in the deck—8 Diamonds, 10 Hearts, 9 Clubs, 8 Spades—and only 1 King and 2 Jacks left, I have plenty of options to build stronger hands by discarding the Hearts and drawing fresh cards.\n\nSince the boss blind forces me to play, I'm calculating potential scores. A Three of a Kind using face cards could work well: three Kings would give 30 base chips, then with Sock and Buskin retriggering each card, that's 60 additional chips from the Kings themselves. Combined with a 3x multiplier and the Zany Joker's +12 boost, I'd reach around 1,350 chips total.\n\nEven a pair of face cards nets 100 chips, which falls short. However, I have discards available to cycle through the deck and avoid Hearts while building toward stronger combinations. Since I can't skip this round anyway and my scoring engine is solid, 600 chips seems achievable with proper card selection.","action":"\"play_round\""}
