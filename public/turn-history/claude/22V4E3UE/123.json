{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $9\n- Just beat the Big Blind (needed 16,500 chips, scored with two Three of a Kind hands)\n\n**Owned Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (6 jokers × 3)\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand, +1 Joker slot, Negative edition\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips (Level 2 → Level 3)\n\n**Shop:**\n- Mail-In Rebate ($4) - Earn $5 for each discarded 4\n- Card Sharp ($6) - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n- Celestial Pack ($4) - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n- Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6) - Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards\n- Magic Trick voucher ($10) - Playing cards can be purchased from the shop\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy strategy is heavily focused on Three of a Kind hands. I have:\n- Zany Joker (polychrome) - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, x1.5\n- The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Abstract Joker - +18 Mult from 6 jokers\n- Hanging Chad - Retriggers first card 2 additional times\n\n\n- Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n\nI have Venus ready to upgrade Three of a Kind from Level 2 to Level 3, gaining 20 chips and 2 Mult. Card Sharp could amplify my scoring since I frequently play Three of a Kind multiple times per round, giving me X3 Mult on repeated hands. The Celestial packs offer flexibility to level up other hands or add new scoring mechanics.\n\nMail-In Rebate doesn't fit my current setup, and Magic Trick is out of budget at $10. Since the next blind is the Ante 5 boss, I need to maximize my scoring potential now. I can spend up to $9: Venus is free and essential, Card Sharp costs $6 and synergizes well with my playstyle, leaving $3 for a Celestial Pack at $4 if I want additional planet cards for future scaling.\n\nCard Sharp is particularly strong since I regularly cycle through Three of a Kind multiple times per round—the X3 Mult multiplier would compound significantly. However, I'm at my joker capacity and would need to sacrifice something. Comparing my current jokers, Zany Joker and Sock and Buskin are both critical to my hand strength, while Abstract Joker provides solid baseline multiplier scaling.\n\nGiven that all my jokers serve important functions, it makes more sense to focus on what I can do without sacrificing. I'll use Venus to strengthen Three of a Kind instead, then consider whether to save for a Celestial Pack or pursue other upgrades.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
