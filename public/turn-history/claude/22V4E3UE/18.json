{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $10\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n- Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 2, so 3 slots available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 0, so 2 slots available)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Business Card - Played face cards have a 1 in 2 chance to give $2 when scored. Cost: $4\n2. Turtle Bean - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round. Cost: $6\n\nBoosters:\n1. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards. Cost: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Crystal Ball - +1 consumable slot. Cost: $10\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Four of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 90, Base Mult 10 (just upgraded!)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3, Times Played 3\n- Full House: Level 1, Base Chips 40, Base Mult 4, Times Played 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just used a planet card to upgrade Four of a Kind to Level 2. My strategy revolves around Three of a Kind/Four of a Kind hands with face cards, synergizing with:\n- Zany Joker (+12 Mult for hands containing Three of a Kind)\n- Sock and Buskin (retrigger all played face cards)\n\nWith $10 remaining, I have several options:\n\n1. **Business Card ($4)** - Generates money when face cards score. \n\nThe face card synergy with Sock and Buskin makes this appealing for economy, though it doesn't directly increase scoring power. Turtle Bean ($6) would expand my hand size temporarily, giving me better odds of assembling the Three/Four of a Kind combinations I need, but the effect diminishes each round. Buffoon Pack ($4) offers another joker slot that could significantly amplify my scoring if it synergizes with my current strategy. Crystal Ball ($10) would consume all my money for a consumable slot I don't currently need.\n\nReroll ($5) would show me other options, but moving forward into Ante 2 seems more valuable since the chip requirements will scale dramatically from my last score of 1,350. The Buffoon Pack stands out as the highest-impact purchase—adding another joker creates opportunities for additional mult/chip scaling and synergies with my face card focus. With $6 remaining after that purchase, I could grab Turtle Bean for the full amount or pick up Business Card ($4) and have $2 left over.\n\nI'll commit to the Buffoon Pack. Once I see what joker it gives me, I can reassess whether the leftover funds go toward Business Card, Turtle Bean, or staying liquid for future rounds.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
