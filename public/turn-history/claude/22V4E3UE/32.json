{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $20\n- Next blind is the Boss Blind requiring 1600 chips\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. Death - Convert one card into another\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Even Steven (Joker) - +4 Mult for even rank cards (10, 8, 6, 4, 2) - $4\n2. The High Priestess (Tarot) - Creates up to 2 random Planet cards - $3\n3. Celestial Pack (Booster) - Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards to use immediately - $4\n4. Standard Pack (Booster) - Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards - $4\n5. Crystal Ball (Voucher) - +1 consumable slot - $10\nReroll: $5\n\n**Boss Blind Analysis:**\nThe Boss Blind restricts me to playing only 1 hand type. This means I need to:\n1. Choose my best hand type\n2. Make sure I can consistently make that hand type\n3. Ensure it can beat 1600 chips\n\n**Hand Type Options:**\n\nBased on my last played hands and joker synergies:\n- **Four of a Kind** (Level 3): Base 120 chips, 13 mult - This is my highest leveled hand\n- **Three of a Kind** (Level 1): Base 30 chips, 3 mult - Synergizes with Zany Joker (+12 mult)\n\n\n- **Flush** (Level 1): Base 35 chips, 4 mult - Just played successfully\n\nFour of a Kind looks most promising. With 4 spade face cards, I'd get 160 base chips plus multipliers from Zany Joker (+12), Abstract Joker (+15), and Wrathful Joker scaling with the spades. This combination should push me well past the 1600 chip threshold needed.\n\nThree of a Kind is another option but would generate less total value since it has fewer cards triggering the multiplier effects.\n\nNow I need to decide what to purchase. Even Steven could add significant multiplier if I build around even-ranked cards, potentially adding 16 mult to Four of a Kind or 12 mult to Three of a Kind. The High Priestess offers a different path by leveling up hand types through random Planet cards, which could strengthen whichever hand I ultimately use against the boss.\n\nThe Celestial Pack guarantees I can pick the specific Planet card I need, making it more reliable than The High Priestess's randomness. Since Four of a Kind is already at Level 3 and performs well, upgrading it further seems like the most direct route to victory. With my $20 budget, I could combine The High Priestess with another purchase, or go straight for Celestial Pack and have funds left over. it will create up to 2 Planet cards, but I only have room for 1 more. So I would only get 1 planet card from it.\n\nIf I buy Crystal Ball first for $10, I'll have 3 consumable slots total, then I can buy The High Priestess and get 2 planet cards.\n\nOr I could just buy the Celestial Pack, use it immediately (doesn't take up a slot), and choose the planet card I want.\n\nThe key difference is that Celestial Pack lets me pick which planet I want right away, while The High Priestess gives random ones but requires inventory space. Since I'm limited on slots, buying the pack first and using it immediately seems more efficient than expanding my inventory just to hold random cards.\n\nLooking at my actual needs: Four of a Kind at Level 3 already generates 10,240 chips, far exceeding the 1600 required for this boss. I don't need to maximize planet cards—I just need to ensure my scoring hand stays strong. The Celestial Pack gives me a guaranteed boost without the extra spending on Crystal Ball and The High Priestess.\n\nI'll go with the Celestial Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
