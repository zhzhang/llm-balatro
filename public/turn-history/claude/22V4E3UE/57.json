{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $19\n- I have 5 jokers (at max capacity)\n- No consumables (max 2 allowed)\n- Just beat the Big Blind\n\n**My Previous Failed Action:**\nI tried to `buy_card 1` (Turtle Bean) but it failed with \"Cannot buy card at position 1\"\n\n**Why did it fail?**\nLooking at the shop, Turtle Bean is not a regular card - it's a joker (even though it's in the \"Shop Cards\" section). Since I already have 5 jokers (max capacity), I cannot buy another joker without selling one first.\n\n**Shop Inventory (all FREE!):**\n1. Turtle Bean (Uncommon Joker) - +5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round - Cost: $0\n2. Mars (Planet) - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips - Cost: $0\n\n**Booster Packs (all FREE!):**\n1. Mega Arcana Pack - Choose 2 of up to 5 Tarot cards - Cost: $0\n2. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - Cost: $0\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nSince everything is free due to the Coupon Tag, I should take maximum advantage of this opportunity.\n\n**Option 1: Sell a joker and buy Turtle Bean**\nTurtle Bean gives +5 hand size initially, which is incredibly powerful. However, it degrades by 1 each round. Looking at my current jokers:\n- Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind (my most played hand)\n- Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n- Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n\n\n- Business Card - Money from face cards (mostly cosmetic)\n- Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant (very powerful)\n\nBusiness Card is the weakest since it only generates money rather than chips or multipliers. I could sell it to make room for Turtle Bean.\n\n**Option 2: Buy Mars (Planet)**\nMars levels up Four of a Kind, but I've only played it once. My strategy centers on Three of a Kind (played 5 times), so Mars doesn't align with my current approach.\n\n**Option 3: Buy Mega Arcana Pack**\nTarot cards can enhance playing cards with various effects. This could be very powerful - I could get cards that add multipliers or other beneficial effects.\n\n**Option 4: Buy Standard Pack**\nAdds playing cards to my deck. Not as immediately impactful as the other options.\n\n**Best Strategy:**\nThe Mega Arcana Pack is most valuable since it provides 2 tarot cards that permanently enhance my deck. Mars is free, so even though Four of a Kind isn't my main strategy, it's worth grabbing. Standard Pack comes next, followed by potentially selling Business Card for Turtle Bean.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider the sequence. The order matters since I can only perform one action at a time. Booster packs should come first—they're the most valuable and don't require inventory management. Mega Arcana Pack gives me permanent enhancements, Mars is free, and Turtle Bean would require selling a joker first for a temporary +5 hand size boost. I'll start by purchasing the Mega Arcana Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
