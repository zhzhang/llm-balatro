{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $23\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots full)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (none currently)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards (not critical for scoring)\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\nCards:\n1. The Hanged Man (Tarot) - Destroys up to 2 selected cards ($3)\n2. Marble Joker - Adds one Stone card to deck when Blind is selected, +50 Chips no rank or suit ($6)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards ($4)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for your most played poker hand ($10)\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) - Most played (4 times)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 3 (120 chips, 13 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) - Played 1 time (just leveled up!)\n- Full House: Level 1 (40 chips, 4 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Other hands mostly level 1\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Four of a Kind - 7,052 chips (Ante 2 Boss)\n\n\n- Flush - 1,995 chips\n- Three of a Kind - 1,890 chips\n\nChips are getting tighter as Ante 3 approaches. My core strength lies in Three of a Kind synergy with Zany Joker, while Sock and Buskin amplifies face card plays. The Wrathful Joker provides conditional boosts depending on spade composition, though it's less reliable than my primary combo.\n\nBusiness Card feels expendable since it only generates money—I need raw scoring power more urgently. Abstract Joker's flat +15 mult would be a solid replacement.\n\nLooking at available purchases, The Hanged Man offers deck thinning but won't immediately boost scores. Marble Joker is more compelling: it generates Stone cards worth +50 chips each when blinds are selected, and since they lack rank or suit, they won't interfere with hand formation while still contributing to my chip total.\n\nTelescope at $10 is pricey but guarantees a Three of a Kind planet upgrade, which matters since that's my most-played hand at level 1. Arcana Pack could provide useful card modifications for $4, or I could reroll for $5 to find better options. With $23 available and maxed joker slots, I'd need to sell something before buying Marble Joker. The real question is whether to invest in Telescope now for long-term scaling or grab cheaper immediate upgrades. would leave me with $19 total. However, Stone cards from Marble Joker could complicate hand formation since they lack rank and suit properties.\n\nI'm convinced the **Telescope** voucher is the better choice—it's a permanent upgrade that directly supports my most-played hand, and with Zany Joker multiplying Three of a Kind hands by 12, leveling this hand consistently will pay dividends in later Antes. After spending $10, I'd have $13 remaining, enough for an Arcana Pack to grab useful tarot enhancements.","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
