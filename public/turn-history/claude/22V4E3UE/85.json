{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- In BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Money: $0\n- Current Blind: Big Blind (7,500 chips needed, $4 reward)\n- Skip option: D6 Tag (Rerolls in next shop start at $0)\n- Upcoming Blind: Boss Blind (10,000 chips needed, $5 reward, \"First hand is drawn face down\")\n\n**Current Jokers (6/6):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind, WITH POLYCHROME (X1.5 Mult)\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade card\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (with 6 jokers)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult if Three of a Kind\n\n**Consumables (1/2):**\n1. The Hierophant - Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n\n**My Three of a Kind Scoring Power:**\nFrom my previous calculation, a Three of a Kind with face cards can score around 15,795 chips, and if it's the final hand, it can score 47,385 chips with Acrobat's X3 multiplier.\n\nThis is more than enough to beat both the Big Blind (7,500) and Boss Blind (10,000).\n\n**Should I skip?**\nThe D6 Tag gives free rerolls in the next shop. However:\n1. I have $0 currently\n2. I can easily beat the Big Blind with my current setup\n3. The $4 reward from Big Blind will give me some money for the shop\n\n\n4. Skipping means I don't get to shop after this blind. The boss blind's \"First hand is drawn face down\" effect is manageable—I can use discards or subsequent hands to see the cards. My setup is strong enough that I don't need the free rerolls, and the $4 will be more useful for actual purchases.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should play the Big Blind. My scoring is so strong that 7,500 chips is trivial for me. The $4 reward will help me in the shop, and skipping provides minimal value since I can handle both blinds easily.\n\nThe command to play the round is: play_round","action":"\"play_round\""}
