Abstract Joker would add +15 mult total if I fill my last slot, scaling multiplicatively with my existing jokers. Death Tarot offers flexibility to convert cards into face cards, which could strengthen my hand composition. I need to weigh whether the immediate mult boost or the card conversion utility serves my strategy better going forward. for the Big Blind (1200 chips) and Boss Blind (1600 chips), the Celestial Pack stands out as the most efficient use of my $4 - leveling Three of a Kind directly strengthens my core strategy. The Abstract Joker also appeals since +15 mult applies to every hand I play. I'm weighing whether to commit to these purchases or reroll for potentially stronger options, then I'd calculate my actual scoring output with the Abstract Joker included to see if it gets me through the upcoming blinds.\n\nWith Abstract Joker added to my current setup, a Three of a Kind hand using three face cards would generate roughly 60 chips from the base hand, then multiply that by my total multiplier of around 36 (combining existing jokers, the new Abstract Joker's +15, and conditional bonuses) for approximately 2,160 chips - enough to handle both blinds comfortably. The Celestial Pack upgrade becomes more interesting when I consider that leveling Three of a Kind from Level 1 to Level 2 would increase its base chips and multiplier, making it a stronger foundation for future hands. ker ($4) to get consistent mult scaling across all hands, then use the reroll ($5) to find better joker options. That leaves $9 for additional purchases.\n\nThe Celestial Pack feels like the more reliable choice though—it directly strengthens Three of a Kind, which is already my strongest hand.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
