{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $4\n- Just completed the Small Blind successfully\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome edition (x1.5) - sells for $4\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards - sells for $3\n3. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (currently with 6 jokers) - sells for $2\n4. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand + 1 Joker slot, Negative edition - sells for $5\n5. The Trio - X3 Mult for Three of a Kind - sells for $4\n6. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - sells for $2\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Rocket - $6 (earns $1 per round, +$2 when Boss defeated) - too expensive\n2. Green Joker - $4 (+1 Mult per hand played, -1 per discard)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Celestial Pack - $4\n2. Celestial Pack - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Magic Trick - $10 (too expensive)\n\nReroll Cost: $5 (too expensive)\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n\nLooking at my hand levels:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, played 8 times (most played)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 4, played only once\n- Two Pair: Level 1, played 4 times\n- Pair: Level 1, played 2 times\n\nI have a strong Three of a Kind synergy with:\n- Zany Joker (+12 Mult, x1.5 from Polychrome = +18 effective mult)\n\n\n- The Trio (x3 Mult)\n\nWith $4 available, I'm choosing between Green Joker and a Celestial Pack. Since I'm at max jokers, the pack is more valuable—it would level Three of a Kind from Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) to Level 2, and with the Telescope voucher, the pack will definitely contain the Three of a Kind planet card.\n\nThis directly strengthens my most-used hand, making it the clear priority over trying to shuffle jokers around.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
