{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current hand:\n\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n4. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n5. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\nI can see:\n- Three Jacks: Jack of Spades, Jack of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds - **THREE OF A KIND!**\n- Two Queens: Queen of Spades, Queen of Hearts\n- Spades: Queen, Jack, 8 (3 spades, need 5 for flush)\n\nThe Three of a Kind of Jacks is perfect! Let me calculate the expected chips:\n\n**Playing Three Jacks (positions 2, 6, 8):**\n\nBase Three of a Kind: 30 chips + 3 mult\n\nPlayed cards contributing to the hand:\n- Jack of Spades: +10 chips\n- Jack of Hearts: +10 chips\n- Jack of Diamonds: +10 chips\nTotal chips from cards: 30 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 chips\n\nNow for the mult calculation:\n\n1. Base mult: 3\n2. Zany Joker: +12 mult (because it's a Three of a Kind) = 15 mult total\n3. Sock and Buskin: Retriggers all played face cards\n   - Each Jack triggers twice (once normally, once from retrigger)\n4. Wrathful Joker: Played cards with Spade suit give +3 Mult when scored\n   - Jack of Spades gives +3 mult each time it's scored\n   - With retrigger, that's +3 mult twice = +6 mult total\n\n\n5. Business Card gives a 50% chance for $2 per face card scored, though this doesn't impact chip totals. The scoring sequence matters here—each card scores left-to-right, with the Jack of Spades triggering Wrathful Joker's bonus twice due to the retrigger effect, followed by the Jack of Hearts scoring normally.\n\nContinuing through the remaining cards: Jack of Diamonds adds 10 chips, then another retrigger from Sock and Buskin adds 10 more chips. This gives 60 total chips from the cards themselves, plus 30 base chips for 90 total. The multiplier calculation shows Wrathful Joker contributing +6 from the Jack of Spades (both the initial score and retrigger), while Zany Joker adds its flat +12 mult, bringing the final multiplier to 21.\n\nMultiplying 90 chips by 21 gives 1,890 points—well above the 800 threshold. I should verify this is optimal by checking alternatives like Two Pair with the Queens and Jacks, but that would only use 4 cards and wouldn't trigger Zany Joker, making it clearly inferior. Playing the three Jacks at positions 2, 6, and 8 is the strongest option.\n\nI need to clarify how card selection works here. Only cards that form part of the hand type contribute their chip values—so with Three of a Kind, just those three Jacks count toward scoring. The other two cards I play won't add chips to the hand itself, though they could still activate joker effects if they're face cards or spades. Sock and Buskin retrigggers all face cards played, and Wrathful Joker affects spades, so I should consider whether including additional cards might boost the multiplier further.\n\nBut the rules state that cards outside the hand don't trigger any effects at all—neither their own \"when played\" abilities nor effects from other sources. This means playing extra cards provides no benefit. I'll select just the three Jacks at positions 2, 6, and 8.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,6,8]"}
