{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- In TAROT_PACK phase (Arcana Pack)\n- $0 remaining\n- Need to choose 1 of 3 tarot cards\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. The Magician - Enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards (1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20)\n2. The Wheel of Fortune - 1 in 4 chance to add Foil/Holographic/Polychrome edition to a random Joker (+50 chips, +10 Mult, or X1.5 Mult)\n3. The Star - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Diamonds\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n6. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank/suit)\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Hierophant - Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI'm focused on Three of a Kind hands with:\n- Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n- The Trio (X3 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n- Sock and Buskin (retriggers face cards)\n- Wrathful Joker (+3 Mult per spade)\n- Abstract Joker (+18 Mult)\n- Acrobat (X3 Mult on final hand)\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n1. **The Magician** - Lucky Cards give 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult. This is somewhat random but could be useful. I could enhance 2 face cards to Lucky Cards.\n\n\n2. **The Wheel of Fortune** - Adding an edition to a random joker is tempting since Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) would be incredibly powerful on The Trio or Abstract Joker. However, the randomness is problematic—I don't control which joker gets enhanced or which edition applies, and there's only a 25% chance of success. The Foil edition (+50 chips) doesn't align with my mult-focused strategy anyway.\n3. **The Star** - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Diamonds, which I can choose strategically.\n\n**Best Choice:**\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune is the strongest option despite its randomness. A 25% chance at Polychrome on my key multiplier jokers would be game-changing, and even Holographic (+10 Mult) provides solid value. The Magician's Lucky Cards mechanic is less reliable at 20% per card. The Star offers no synergy with my current setup. I'm going with The Wheel of Fortune.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
