{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n1. This is the very beginning of the game - Ante 1/8, Round 0\n2. I'm at the BLIND_SELECT phase\n3. I have no jokers, no consumables, and $4\n4. Current blind is Small (300 chips needed, $3 reward)\n5. If I skip, I get Coupon Tag (free initial cards and booster packs in next shop)\n6. Next blind is Big (450 chips needed, $4 reward)\n7. If I skip Big, I get Rare Tag (free Rare Joker in shop)\n8. Boss blind is after that (600 chips, debuffs all Heart cards)\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- At the start of the game with no jokers, the Small blind (300 chips) should be very beatable with a standard deck\n- The Coupon Tag would give me free items in the shop, which could be valuable\n- However, I'd miss out on the $3 reward and any shop opportunity after beating the Small blind\n- If I skip Small blind for the Coupon Tag, I'd go straight to the Big blind decision\n- The Rare Tag from skipping Big would give a free Rare Joker\n\nEarly game strategy:\n- Generally, you want to start building your economy and joker collection early\n- Skipping the Small blind means missing the first shop opportunity and the $3\n- The Coupon Tag could potentially save me money in the next shop, but I'd be going into the Big blind (450 chips) without any jokers or shop upgrades\n- Playing the Small blind lets me:\n  * Earn $3\n  * Get interest on my money\n  * Access the first shop to buy jokers/consumables\n  * Build a foundation for the harder blinds ahead\n\nThe Small blind at 300 chips should be very manageable with a starting deck. Even with just basic hands like pairs and two pairs, I should easily beat it.\n\nI think the best play is to play the Small blind. This gives me:\n\n\n- The $3 reward plus access to the first shop where I can start acquiring jokers and consumables. While the Coupon Tag seems appealing, facing the Big blind without any setup would be risky. Building my collection early is more important than getting discounted items later.\n\nMy action: play_round","action":"\"play_round\""}
