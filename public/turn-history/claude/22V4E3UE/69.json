{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $28\n- Just rerolled the shop for $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade scored\n4. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (for 5 jokers)\n5. Turtle Bean - +4 hand size (reduces by 1 every round)\n\n**New Shop Items:**\nCards:\n1. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round ($6)\n2. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining ($5)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - Choose 1 of 2 Spectral cards ($4)\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently ($10)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- Flush - 4,896 chips (Ante: 3, Boss)\n- Three of a Kind - 1,881 chips (Ante: 3, Big Blind)\n- Four of a Kind - 7,052 chips (Ante: 2, Boss)\n\nI'm now at Ante 4, which means chip requirements will be significantly higher. Let me think about the new joker options:\n\n**Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round ($6):**\nThis is a multiplicative multiplier that activates on the final hand. This could be very powerful if I'm trying to win in one hand or if I'm down to my last hand. However, it's a bit situational - I'd prefer to win rounds without cutting it that close.\n\n\nMystic Summit offers consistent additive mult but demands I burn through all discards first—with 4 discards per round, that's a demanding constraint to reliably satisfy. My current setup leans heavily on spades with Wrathful Joker, while Sock and Buskin's face card retriggering and Abstract Joker's baseline mult provide solid scaling.\n\nI'm at capacity with 5/5 jokers, so acquiring either Acrobat or Mystic Summit means sacrificing something. Zany Joker only triggers on Three of a Kind hands, which generated minimal chips. Turtle Bean's value keeps eroding as it diminishes. Wrathful Joker remains essential for spade plays, and Sock and Buskin's retriggering is too valuable to lose. That leaves Zany Joker as the weakest link. Acrobat's multiplicative X3 is particularly tempting since it compounds whatever hand value I build—even a modest 3000-chip hand becomes 9000 with that multiplier.\n\nThe chip scaling ahead will be steep, and a consistent X3 multiplier could be the difference in surviving harder antes. Selling Zany Joker for $2 gets me to $30, then Acrobat costs $6, leaving $24 to work with. The Spectral Pack is tempting but too unpredictable at $4. I'm leaning toward the Acrobat trade. ystyle. Mystic Summit offers +15 mult when I have no discards left, which would stack with my Abstract Joker's baseline for solid additive gains, but it lacks the multiplicative punch of Acrobat. The X3 multiplier on my final hand is more impactful for scaling as chip requirements climb, so I'm leaning toward Acrobat despite needing to play it strategically as a finishing move rather than relying on it early.\n\nThough I should also consider the Spectral Pack—cards like Ankh can duplicate a random joker or Familiar can destroy a card and add 3, which could unlock unexpected synergies.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
