{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully.\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n2. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n3. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n5. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n6. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Best Hand Available:**\nI have THREE OF A KIND with three 6s! (6 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, 6 of Diamonds)\n\n**Resources:**\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 0 (can't discard anymore)\n- Current chips: 0\n- Chips needed: 11,000\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5) = effectively +18 mult when triggered\n2. Sock and Buskin: Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult\n4. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n5. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n6. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\nPerfect! I got the Three of a Kind I was looking for. Let me calculate the expected chips:\n\n**Base Hand:**\n- Three of a Kind: 30 chips base, 3 mult base\n- Three 6s contribute: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 chips\n\n**With Hanging Chad:**\nThe first card played (first 6) will be retriggered 2 additional times = 3 total activations\nSo first 6 contributes: 6 × 3 = 18 chips\nSecond 6: 6 chips\n\n\nThird 6: 6 chips\nTotal from cards: 30 chips\n\n**Multiplier Calculation:**\nBase mult: 3\nAbstract Joker: +18\nZany Joker with polychrome applies x1.5 to its +12 mult contribution, giving +18 mult total. The Trio adds another x3 mult for the three of a kind, and Acrobat multiplies everything by x3 on the final hand.\n\nCalculating the full chain: 3 base + 18 (Abstract) + 18 (Zany polychrome) = 39 mult, then 39 × 3 (Trio) = 117 mult.\n\nScore: 60 chips × 117 mult = 7,020 points. This covers 64% of my 11,000 target with four hands left, so I'm on track. I'll play the three 6s to trigger the Trio bonus.\n\nFor card selection, I need to be careful—only cards that form the scoring hand contribute chips and activate effects. The Jack and Queen won't participate in the Three of a Kind, so they won't generate points or trigger Sock and Buskin. I should stick with just the three 6s. Since Hanging Chad retrigs the first card played, I'll lead with a 6 to maximize that effect.\n\nNow considering timing: Acrobat multiplies by 3 on my final hand only, and I have 4 hands left, so this isn't the right moment to use it. But if I save this Three of a Kind for my last hand, I could stack Acrobat's multiplier on top. That would give me 60 chips × 117 mult (base 39 × 3 from The Trio) × 3 from Acrobat = 351 total, which is significantly better than playing it now.\n\nHowever, I only have 2 more 6s in the deck, making another Three of a Kind impossible. Playing this hand now gives me 7,020 chips toward my 11,000 target, leaving 3,980 chips still needed from my remaining hands.\n\nThat breaks down to roughly 1,327 chips per hand, which feels achievable with my available jokers. I could play conservatively and build weaker hands, but that risks not having strong cards when I need them most. I'll go ahead and play the Three of a Kind with positions 2, 4, and 7.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,4,7]"}
