{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase after buying a Celestial Pack. I have three planet card choices:\n\n1. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\n2. Saturn - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips\n3. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips\n\nMy hand levels show:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, played 8 times (most played)\n- Straight: Level 1, played 1 time\n- Straight Flush: Level 1, played 0 times\n\nMy joker synergy heavily favors Three of a Kind:\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, with Polychrome (x1.5) = effectively +18 mult\n- The Trio: x3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n\nThree of a Kind is clearly my primary strategy. I've played it 8 times already, and I have two jokers specifically dedicated to boosting it.\n\nVenus would take Three of a Kind from Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) to Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult).\n\nSaturn would level up Straight, which I've only played once and have no specific synergy for.\n\nNeptune would level up Straight Flush, which I've never played and have no synergy for.\n\nThe clear choice is Venus (position 1) to level up Three of a Kind, which is my most-played hand type and has the best joker synergy.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
