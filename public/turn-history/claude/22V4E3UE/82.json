{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $4\n- Just bought The Trio joker\n\n**Current Jokers (6/6 - maxed out):**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per scored spade card\n4. Abstract Joker - +18 Mult (with 6 jokers now)\n5. Acrobat - X3 Mult on final hand of round\n6. The Trio - X3 Mult if Three of a Kind\n\n**Consumables (1/2):**\n1. The Hierophant - Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Raised Fist: $5 (I only have $4)\n- Arcana Pack: $4 (I can afford this)\n- Buffoon Pack: $4 (I can afford this)\n- Tarot Merchant voucher: $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 7,500 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 10,000 chips needed (First hand is drawn face down)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy Three of a Kind strategy is now extremely powerful with The Trio (X3) added to Zany Joker (+12). Let me calculate what a Three of a Kind would score now:\n\nBase: 30 chips, 3 mult\nAdd cards (say 3 Kings): +30 chips = 60 total chips\nSock and Buskin retriggers face cards: +30 more chips = 90 total chips\n\n\nWith all multipliers stacked—Abstract Joker at +18, Zany at +12, plus a spade for +3 from Wrathful—I'm looking at 36 mult, then tripled by The Trio to 108. That's 90 × 108 = 9,720 chips. If it's the final hand, Acrobat doubles that multiplier again, pushing it even higher.\n\nI'm in a strong position to handle the upcoming blinds. Since my joker slots are full, the Buffoon Pack won't help without selling something. The Arcana Pack could add value through tarots, but honestly, my current setup feels sufficient to push forward without additional purchases.\n\nThe boss blind's \"first hand drawn face down\" effect is manageable given my chip count. I'll proceed to the next round and see how it plays out.\n\nBuying the Arcana Pack seems worthwhile—it could unlock additional enhancements or effects that strengthen my deck further, making the remaining blinds more straightforward to navigate.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
