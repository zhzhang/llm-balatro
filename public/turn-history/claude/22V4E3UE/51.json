{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (3000 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $9\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (Steel Card - +10 chips, X1.5 Mult while in hand)\n2. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n3. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n4. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n5. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retriggers all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**Best Hand Available:**\nI have a pair of Kings (King of Spades and King of Diamonds)\n\n**Key Strategic Point:**\nThe King of Spades is a Steel Card that gives X1.5 Mult while it STAYS IN HAND. This means I should NOT play it - I should keep it in hand to get the multiplier bonus.\n\n**Possible Plays:**\n\nOption 1: Play pair of Kings (but this would use the Steel King, losing the x1.5 mult)\nOption 2: Play just King of Diamonds and keep King of Spades in hand for the x1.5 mult\n\nActually, let me think about what hands I can make while keeping the King of Spades in hand:\n\n\nIf I keep the Steel King benched, I'm left with 8♥, 5♥, 4♥, 7♣, A♦, K♦, 2♦. Without the second King, my best option is just a high card with the Ace, which won't generate nearly enough chips to hit 3000. I need to reconsider whether keeping the Steel King in hand is actually worth sacrificing stronger hand combinations. The Zany Joker needs a Three of a Kind to activate, and I don't have three matching cards available right now.\n\nLooking at what's left in the deck, there are four Aces remaining, three 8s, three 5s, three 7s, three 2s, and only one 4. My best bet is to keep the Ace and discard everything else to maximize my chances of drawing into either more Aces or another set. If I could assemble three Kings including the Steel King, I'd score 30 base chips plus 30 from the three Kings themselves, totaling 60 chips—but that's still far short of what I need.\n\nWith the Zany Joker adding 12 for three of a kind, Wrathful Joker contributing 3 for the spade King, and Abstract Joker providing 15, my multiplier reaches 33. Even with Sock and Buskin retriggering the face cards, 60 × 33 only gets me to 1,980 chips, which isn't sufficient. However, if I keep the Steel King in hand and instead play three Aces, I'd have 63 base chips. The Zany Joker still gives 12, Abstract Joker gives 15, and then the Steel King multiplies everything by 1.5—a much stronger position.\n\nBut I'm still falling short at 2,835 chips. I should explore whether Four of a Kind or a different hand structure could work better. Actually, reconsidering the Sock and Buskin interaction: if I play three Kings, each one scores twice due to the retrigger effect, giving me 90 chips instead. The Wrathful Joker would also trigger twice since the King of Spades scores twice, and combined with Zany's bonus and Abstract's contribution, I could push the multiplier significantly higher.\n\nWith three Kings, I'd reach 3,240 chips—that's enough. So I need to find a third King from the remaining deck. I'll need to discard strategically to maximize my chances of drawing it while protecting the two Kings I already have.\n\nThe best approach is to let go of my lowest cards: the 2♦, 4♥, 5♥, 7♣, and 8♥. The Ace is worth keeping since it has higher value, so those five cards give me the best shot at pulling another King.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,8]"}
