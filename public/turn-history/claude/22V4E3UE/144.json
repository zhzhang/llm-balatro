{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 6/8, Round 14\n- In BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Money: $2\n- Have Investment Tag (will give $25 after beating Boss Blind)\n- Have Polychrome Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n\n**My Joker Setup:**\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind, Polychrome (x1.5)\n2. Abstract Joker: +18 Mult (for 6 jokers)\n3. Acrobat: X3 Mult on final hand\n4. The Trio: X3 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n6. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand type already played this round\n\n**Boss Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 40,000\n- Boss effect: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\" (1 in 7 cards are drawn face down/debuffed)\n- Reward: $5\n- After beating this, I get $25 from Investment Tag\n\n**Previous Performance:**\n- My last Three of a Kind scored 45,441 chips (Ante 5, Boss)\n- That's more than enough for Boss Blind (40,000)\n- I've consistently scored well with Three of a Kind\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nSince I just skipped both the Small and Big Blinds, I now must play the Boss Blind (you cannot skip boss blinds). The question is whether I should play it now or do anything else first.\n\nLooking at my available commands:\n- play_round - Play the current round\n- use_consumable - I have no consumables\n- sell_consumable - I have no consumables\n- rearrange_jokers - Could potentially help\n- sell_joker - Not needed right now\n\n\n- The boss effect means roughly 1 in 7 cards will be face down, but with 8 cards typically in hand, I can still form Three of a Kind even with 1-2 debuffed cards. My previous score of 45,441 gives me a comfortable margin above the 40,000 threshold needed. The joker arrangement shouldn't matter much since boss effects trigger before my on-played abilities activate.\n\nLooking at my joker lineup, most of them are independent activators that trigger left-to-right: Zany Joker provides +12 Mult and a polychrome boost for Three of a Kind, Abstract Joker adds +18 Mult, Acrobat multiplies by 3 on the final hand, The Trio multiplies by 3 specifically for Three of a Kind, Hanging Chad retriggers my first played card twice more, and Card Sharp multiplies by 3 if the hand's already been played. For Three of a Kind scoring, the base calculation starts with these multipliers stacking together. to-right:\n   - Zany Joker: +12 mult, then its edition (polychrome x1.5)\n   - Abstract Joker: +18 mult\n   - Acrobat: X3 (only on final hand)\n   - The Trio: X3\n   - Hanging Chad: Retriggers first card (affects chips, not directly mult)\n   - Card Sharp: X3 (if hand already played)\n\nI need to optimize by placing additive bonuses before multiplicative ones. With the current arrangement: Mult = ((11 + 12) * 1.5 + 18) * 3 * 3 = (23 * 1.5 + 18) * 9 = (34.5 + 18) *\n\n9 = 52.5 * 9 = 472.5\n\nRearranging to Abstract (+18), Zany (+12 then x1.5), The Trio (x3), Card Sharp (x3) yields: Mult = ((11 + 18 + 12) * 1.5) * 3 * 3 = (41 * 1.5) * 9 = 61.5 * 9 = 553.5, which is significantly better. I need to reconsider how the polychrome edition's x1.5 multiplier works—whether it applies only to Zany's +12 contribution or to the entire mult value at that calculation point.\n\nThe system indicates jokers activate independently left-to-right with their editions factored in, suggesting the polychrome multiplier applies directly to that joker's output. So Zany with polychrome effectively becomes +18 mult (12 * 1.5). This means Abstract and Zany both contribute +18, while The Trio and Card Sharp each provide x3 multipliers. The optimal sequence places all additive jokers first, then multiplicative ones: Abstract, Zany, The Trio, and Card Sharp in positions 1, 2, 4, and 6 respectively, with Acrobat and Hanging Chad filling positions 3 and 5.\n\nAcrobat only triggers on the final hand and Hanging Chad affects card retriggering, so neither directly impacts the core multiplication chain. Given that my previous Three of a Kind already scored 45,441 chips—well above the 40,000 threshold—I should proceed with playing the round rather than overthinking further positioning details.","action":"\"play_round\""}
