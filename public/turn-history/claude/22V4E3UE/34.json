{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $16\n- Next blind is Boss Blind (Round 6 of Ante 2)\n- Boss restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\" (based on context from previous turns)\n- Boss requires 1600 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult constant\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. Death - Convert one card into another\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Even Steven (Joker) - +4 Mult for even rank cards (10, 8, 6, 4, 2) - $4\n2. The High Priestess (Tarot) - Creates up to 2 random Planet cards - $3\n3. Standard Pack (Booster) - Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards - $4\n4. Crystal Ball (Voucher) - +1 consumable slot - $10\nReroll: $5\n\n**Boss Strategy:**\nI need to decide on one hand type to play for the boss round. Based on my previous performance:\n- Four of a Kind (Level 3): 120 base chips, 13 base mult - strongest hand\n- Three of a Kind (Level 1): 30 base chips, 3 base mult - synergizes with Zany Joker (+12 mult)\n- Flush (Level 1): 35 base chips, 4 base mult - just played successfully\n\nI skipped the planet pack because none of them upgraded Four of a Kind or Three of a Kind, which are my best options.\n\n\nFour of a Kind looks most promising for the boss. With my Abstract Joker providing +15 mult and the hand's base 13 mult, I'm at 28. The Zany Joker triggers since Four of a Kind contains three of a kind, adding another +12 for 40 total. If I can score four spade face cards, Wrathful Joker pushes this to 52 mult on top of the 120 base chips.\n\nThe real advantage comes from Sock and Buskin retriggering those face cards. Playing four spades gives me 40 chips that double to 80 when retriggered, bringing my chip total to 200. For mult, the retriggered face cards from Wrathful would add another 12, stacking on top of my existing 40 for a final score around 10,400 chips.\n\nThree of a Kind is more achievable though—three spade face cards would net me 90 chips and 48 mult for roughly 4,300 chips. Either way, I'm well above the 1,600 chip threshold I need.\n\nNow for the shop: Even Steven looks particularly strong since I can stack it with high even cards like 10s, potentially adding 16 mult to a Four of a Kind or 12 mult to Three of a Kind. The High Priestess creates planets but I'm already at my limit. Standard Pack could help me find specific cards, and Crystal Ball would give me an extra consumable slot for $10. I could also reroll for $5 if these options don't appeal to me. The key is figuring out what helps me most given my current hand strength and what I'm trying to build toward.\n\nSince I'm already at my joker capacity, I'd need to sacrifice one to make room for Even Steven. Business Card seems like the most expendable since it's primarily for money generation, which matters less in a boss fight compared to the direct mult boosts from my other jokers. Zany Joker, Sock and Buskin, and Abstract Joker all provide critical damage multipliers that would be harder to replace.\n\nBut honestly, my current setup should handle the 1600-chip requirement without needing Even Steven. The combination of my existing jokers—particularly Abstract Joker's constant +15 mult and Zany Joker's bonus for Three of a Kind—gives me enough firepower. I'll stick with what I have and move forward.","action":"\"round_select\""}
