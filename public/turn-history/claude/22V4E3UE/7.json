{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round 1\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $4\n- Owned Jokers: Zany Joker (+12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind)\n- No consumables\n\n**Blind Select Options:**\n1. **Play Big Blind:**\n   - Chips needed: 450\n   - Reward: $4\n   - No special boss effects\n\n2. **Skip Big Blind:**\n   - Tag reward: Rare Tag (Shop has a free Rare Joker)\n   - Would go directly to Boss Blind selection\n\n**Upcoming Boss Blind:**\n- Chips needed: 600\n- Boss Description: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me think about whether I should play or skip the Big Blind.\n\n**Can I beat Big Blind (450 chips)?**\n\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- Three of a Kind scored 153 chips\n- Three of a Kind scored 180 chips  \n- Two Pair scored 88 chips\n\nWith Zany Joker now (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind):\n- Base Three of a Kind: 30 chips + card values, 3 base mult\n- With Zany: +12 mult = 15 mult total\n\nIf I play three 7s again:\n- Chips: 30 (base) + 21 (7+7+7) = 51 chips\n- Mult: 3 (base) + 12 (Zany) = 15 mult\n- Total: 51 × 15 = 765 chips\n\nThat's already 765 chips in ONE hand, well over the 450 needed!\n\nEven with lower cards like three 2s:\n- Chips: 30 (base) + 6 (2+2+2) = 36 chips\n\n\n- Mult: 15\n- Total: 36 × 15 = 540 chips\n\nI can comfortably beat the Big Blind with minimal effort. Playing gives me $4 plus access to the shop, while skipping means I miss that money and go straight to the Boss Blind without the intermediate shop opportunity.\n\nThe Boss debuffs Hearts, but that's not a problem since my Three of a Kind strategy doesn't depend on suit composition. I'll just avoid playing Heart cards.\n\nI'm going to play through Big Blind. The $4 reward and shopping access outweigh the Rare Tag, especially since I can reassess whether to skip the Boss Blind afterward.","action":"\"play_round\""}
