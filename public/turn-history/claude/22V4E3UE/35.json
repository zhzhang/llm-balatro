{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $16\n- Current Blind: Boss\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Boss Description: Play only 1 hand type this round\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n2. Sock and Buskin - Retrigger all played face cards\n3. Wrathful Joker - +3 Mult per spade card scored\n4. Business Card - Money from face cards\n5. Abstract Joker - +15 Mult (constant)\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. Death - Convert one card into another\n\n**Available Commands:**\n- play_round - Play the current round\n- use_consumable\n- sell_consumable\n- rearrange_jokers\n- sell_joker\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at the Blind Select phase for the Boss Blind. The boss restriction is \"Play only 1 hand type this round\" which means I can only play one type of hand throughout the entire round.\n\nLooking at my previous performance:\n- Four of a Kind (Level 3): 120 base chips, 13 base mult - my strongest leveled hand\n- Three of a Kind (Level 1): Has been played successfully for 1,890 chips and 1,350 chips in recent rounds\n- Flush: Played for 1,995 chips\n\nThe boss requires 1,600 chips. Based on my recent hands:\n- Three of a Kind achieved 1,890 chips on the Small Blind\n- Flush achieved 1,995 chips on the Big Blind\n\nBoth of these are above the 1,600 threshold.\n\nMy joker setup strongly supports hands with Three of a Kind:\n- Zany Joker gives +12 Mult if the hand contains Three of a Kind (which means Four of a Kind also triggers this)\n\n\n- Abstract Joker provides a flat +15 Mult boost\n- Sock and Buskin retriggers face cards for additional scoring\n- Wrathful Joker adds +3 Mult per spade in the scored hand\n\nSince I need to commit to ONE hand type for this boss round, Three of a Kind is my safest bet—I've consistently scored 1,350-1,890 chips with it. Four of a Kind would hit harder but is less reliable to form. Before playing, I should check if my joker arrangement is optimal or if I need to use my Death consumable to adjust my hand composition.\n\nLooking at my current joker sequence, the order matters significantly for how effects chain during scoring. Zany Joker triggers independently when Three of a Kind is played, while Sock and Buskin needs to retrigger face cards at the right moment in the sequence. Wrathful Joker's spade multiplier and Business Card's money generation both depend on what cards actually score. Abstract Joker's flat bonus applies regardless. The triggering sequence follows: boss effects first, then 'on played' jokers activate before any cards score, cards score left-to-right with their individual modifiers, 'on scored' jokers fire during that scoring phase, retriggers happen next, and finally held-in-hand abilities resolve.\n\nThis means Wrathful Joker will trigger as spades score, and Sock and Buskin will retrigger those face cards to maximize the spade multiplier stacking. The independent jokers add their mult at the very end. I think the current arrangement works well enough.\n\nFor the Death consumable, converting a card could help build stronger hands, but since I'm already doing well with Three of a Kind and don't know what's available, holding onto it makes sense. The move is to play the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
