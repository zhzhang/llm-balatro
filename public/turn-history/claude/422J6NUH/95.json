{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (selecting from a Celestial Pack)\n- Current Money: $10\n- Need to prepare for Boss Blind which requires 22,000 chips\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Pluto (Level 2): Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n2. Mercury (Level 1): Level up Pair +1 Mult and +15 chips  \n3. Venus (Level 1): Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\n\n**Current Strategy:**\nI've been playing a flush-focused strategy with:\n- Flush at Level 5 (95 chips, 12 mult) - played 12 times\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips if flush\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult if flush\n- Last flush scored 20,406 chips\n\n**Problem:**\nNone of these planet cards level up Flush! The pack doesn't contain a planet for Flush (which would be Neptune). This is unfortunate because I specifically bought this pack hoping to level up my Flush hand.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\nLooking at my hand history:\n- Flush: 12 plays (main strategy)\n- Three of a Kind: 2 plays\n- High Card: 1 play\n- Pair: 1 play\n\nSince I can't upgrade Flush here, I should think about:\n1. What hands might I need as backup?\n2. What could be useful in general?\n\n**Venus (Three of a Kind):** I've played this twice, and it can be a decent backup hand when I can't make a flush. Upgrading it from Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) to Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult) gives +20 chips and +2 mult. This is actually a significant upgrade.\n\n\nPair is rarely useful given my flush-focused jokers, and upgrading it only yields +15 chips and +2 mult. High Card is even less practical—it's my fallback when nothing else works, and the +10 chips and +1 mult gain is minimal. Venus offers the strongest improvement for a hand I actually use as a backup.\n\nThe boss blind's face-down mechanic makes constructing flushes unreliable, so having a dependable Three of a Kind matters more here. I'll take Venus.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
