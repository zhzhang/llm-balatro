{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 1\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $6\n- Jokers: Crafty Joker (+80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush)\n- No consumables\n\n**Shop Available:**\nCards:\n1. The Fool (Tarot) - $3 - Creates last Tarot/Planet card used. Secondary: Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts\n2. Greedy Joker - $5 - Played Diamond cards give +3 Mult when scored\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Celestial Pack - $6 - Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards to use immediately\n\nVouchers:\n1. Clearance Sale - $10 - All cards and packs 25% off\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**My Strategy Considerations:**\n\nI have $6 to work with. Let me think about what's most valuable:\n\n1. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)** - This would use all my money but let me pick from 5 Planet cards to level up a hand type. Since I have Crafty Joker that synergizes with Flushes, leveling up Flush would be excellent. This would use all $6.\n\n2. **Greedy Joker ($5)** - Gives +3 Mult per Diamond card scored. I had a Steel Ace of Diamonds. This could stack with Crafty Joker if I build Diamond Flushes. Leaves me with $1.\n\n3. **The Fool ($3)** - Can't use this yet since I haven't used any Tarot or Planet cards yet. Leaves me with $3.\n\n4. **Reroll ($5)** - See new options, leaves me with $1.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have Crafty Joker which rewards Flushes\n\n\n- Flush performed well last round at 402 chips\n- Ante 2 will demand higher chip counts\n- The Jumbo Celestial Pack costs exactly what I have\n\nLeveling up Flush through a Planet card would directly amplify my Crafty Joker's effectiveness while scaling both base chips and multiplier. This feels like the strongest immediate power spike available with my current budget.\n\nThough I should weigh this against grabbing Greedy Joker instead—two jokers working together could potentially outpace a single leveled hand early on. With Greedy adding +3 Mult per Diamond scored, a Diamond Flush would gain significant multiplier, while Crafty provides the chip boost. But leveling Flush to 2 would increase its base values substantially, making future scoring more efficient overall.\n\nThe key difference is that leveling the hand works consistently across any suit, whereas Greedy only triggers on Diamonds. Since I need reliable scaling and the hand level bonus compounds, buying the Jumbo Celestial Pack to level Flush seems like the more stable choice.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
