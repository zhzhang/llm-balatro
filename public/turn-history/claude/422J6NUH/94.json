{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $14\n- Just beat Big Blind with 20,406 chips (the lucky card triggered!)\n\n**Upcoming Boss Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Boss Effect: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n- This is a significant challenge as I won't be able to see what cards I draw after playing hands\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +108 Chips (currently)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Juggler: +1 hand size - $4\n2. The High Priestess: Creates up to 2 random Planet cards - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards - $6\n2. Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Overstock: +1 card slot in shop - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy last flush scored 20,406 chips, which is already very close to the 22,000 needed for the boss. The challenge with the boss is that cards are drawn face down after each hand, making it hard to construct flushes consistently.\n\nLet me think about what I need:\n1. My flush scoring is strong: ~13,000-20,000 chips per flush (depending on lucky card)\n\n\n2. I'm only 1,600 chips short of the target\n3. The blind's face-down mechanic severely limits my ability to plan hand construction\n\nFor the shop, I should consider how each option helps me bridge that gap. Juggler gives me more cards to work with initially, which could help me spot better hands before the face-down draws kick in. The High Priestess or Celestial Pack would let me upgrade my Flush further, pushing my scoring higher. The Jumbo Arcana Pack offers more flexibility but costs more.\n\nMy Flush is already strong at Level 5 with 95 chips and 12 multiplier. If I level it to 6, I'd gain roughly 15 more chips and 1 more multiplier, which compounds across my whole scoring engine—the Blue Joker alone would add more value with that extra multiplier. That upgrade could be the difference between falling short and hitting 22,000.\n\nI should focus my $14 budget on three purchases: the Celestial Pack to boost Flush's base stats, Juggler to expand my hand size and card options, and The High Priestess for additional planet cards that'll help with future leveling. These three moves directly strengthen my scoring potential and flexibility.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
