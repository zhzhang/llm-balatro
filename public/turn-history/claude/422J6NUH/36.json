{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the TAROT_PACK phase, need to choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards\n- Money: $3\n- Current jokers are all focused on Flush strategy:\n  1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips for Flush\n  2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult for Flush\n  3. 8 Ball (Foil): +100 chips, chance to create Tarot cards from 8s\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. King of Hearts\n2. Jack of Hearts\n3. 2 of Hearts\n4. 8 of Clubs\n5. 10 of Diamonds\n6. 5 of Diamonds\n7. 3 of Diamonds\n8. 2 of Diamonds\n\nSo I have:\n- 3 Hearts (King, Jack, 2)\n- 1 Club (8)\n- 4 Diamonds (10, 5, 3, 2)\n\n**Tarot Card Choices:**\n1. **The Chariot**: Enhances 1 card into a Steel Card (X1.5 Mult while in hand)\n2. **The Magician**: Enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards (1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20)\n3. **The Sun**: Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy strategy is heavily Flush-focused. I need 5 cards of the same suit to make a Flush.\n\nCurrent suit distribution:\n- Hearts: 3 cards\n- Diamonds: 4 cards\n- Clubs: 1 card\n\n**The Sun** could convert up to 3 cards to Hearts. If I convert the 4 Diamonds and the Club to Hearts, I could have many more Hearts for Flush opportunities. \n\nConverting 3 cards to Hearts would give me 6 Hearts total, which significantly improves my Flush consistency. **The Magician** offers probabilistic boosts through Lucky Cards, while **The Chariot** only multiplies a single card. Since my entire deck is built around Flush payoffs, **The Sun** directly amplifies that strategy by giving me enough Hearts to reliably hit the hand.\n\nI'd target the Diamonds for conversion since I have four of them—converting three would leave me with 6 Hearts and just 2 Diamonds remaining. This maximizes my Flush draw odds without sacrificing too much suit diversity.\n\nThe optimal conversion would be the 8 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds, and 5 of Diamonds, giving me a strong 6-Heart hand. I'll select the Sun and make these three conversions to solidify my Flush strategy.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6]"}
