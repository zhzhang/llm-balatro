{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n4. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n5. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n6. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n7. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n8. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n\n**Goal:** 11,000 chips needed\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Wee Joker: Gains +8 Chips per scored 2 (Currently +0)\n\n**Resources:**\n- 4 hands remaining\n- 3 discards remaining\n- The Moon consumable (converts up to 3 cards to Clubs)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have 7 hearts in hand (positions 2-8), which is perfect! I can play a 5-card flush in hearts.\n\nLet me calculate the best flush to play:\n\nOption 1: Play 7♥, 7♥, 5♥, 4♥, 3♥ (positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n- Base flush chips: 95\n- Card chips: 7 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 26\n- Crafty Joker: +80\n- 8 Ball: +50\n- Total chips: 95 + 26 + 80 + 50 = 251\n\n- Base mult: 12\n- Droll Joker: +10\n\n\n- Gros Michel: +15\n- Total mult: 37\n\n- Total score: 251 × 37 = 9,287 chips\n\nOption 2: Play 7♥, 5♥, 4♥, 3♥, 2♥ (positions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7)\n- Base flush chips: 95\n- Card chips: 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 21\n- Crafty Joker: +80\n- 8 Ball: +50\n- Total chips: 95 + 21 + 80 + 50 = 246\n\n- Base mult: 12\n- Droll Joker: +10\n- Gros Michel: +15\n- Total mult: 37\n\n- Total score: 246 × 37 = 9,102 chips\n\nOption 1 yields slightly more with the pair of 7s. However, Option 2 leaves a 2 in hand, which could trigger Wee Joker's bonus if I score it later. Neither option gets me close to 11,000 chips in a single hand, so I need to think about how to build toward that goal across multiple hands. + 80 + 50 + 16 = 260\n\n- Base mult: 12\n- Droll Joker: +10\n- Gros Michel: +15\n- Total mult: 37\n\n- Total score: 260 × 37 = 9,620 chips\n\nNow considering a hand with two pairs: 7♥, 7♥, 2♥, 2♥, 5♥. This gives me a flush while also containing paired cards, which could interact with the jokers differently. The base flush chips remain 95, card values sum to 23, and I'd still get the same multiplier boost from my jokers for a total of 9,695 chips.\n\nNone of these approaches are reaching the 11,000 threshold. I need a fundamentally different strategy. The Moon consumable could help—converting the Ace of Spades to a club might open up better hand possibilities, or I could focus on building toward a stronger suit combination.\n\nWith 4 hands left to play, I don't need to maximize every single hand. Playing a solid flush now and then attempting another strong hand afterward gives me more flexibility. I have 7 hearts already, which is a strong foundation for a flush, so I should commit to that and preserve my remaining hands for additional scoring opportunities.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,7,8,4]"}
