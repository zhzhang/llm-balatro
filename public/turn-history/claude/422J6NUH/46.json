{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (Boss Blind)\n- Boss Effect: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 4,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $18\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n2. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n3. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n4. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n5. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n6. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n7. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n\n**Flush Build:**\n- Level 4 Flush: 80 base chips, 10 base mult\n- Need 5 cards of the same suit\n\n**Available Flushes in Current Hand:**\n- Hearts: 9♥, 8♥, 2♥ (only 3 cards)\n- Spades: 5♠, 3♠ (only 2 cards)\n- Clubs: A♣, 10♣ (only 2 cards)\n- Diamonds: 7♦ (only 1 card)\n\nI don't have a flush in my current hand! I need to discard and draw to try to get 5 cards of the same suit.\n\n\nHearts dominate the remaining deck with 16 cards left, compared to 11 spades, 10 diamonds, and only 7 clubs. Since I already have three hearts, I'll hold onto those and discard the rest—5♠, 3♠, A♣, 10♣, 7♦—to maximize my chances of drawing two more hearts for a complete flush.\n\nIf I hit the flush, the scoring looks strong: five hearts would generate roughly 35 card chips on top of the 80 base, plus 80 from Crafty Joker and 50 from 8 Ball for 245 total chips. With a base multiplier of 10 and Droll Joker adding 10 more, I'd reach 20x multiplier, giving me 4,900 chips—well above the 4,000 threshold.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,7,8]"}
