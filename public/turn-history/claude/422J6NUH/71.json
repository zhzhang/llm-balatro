{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- Boss Blind requiring 20,000 chips\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n2. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 to win $20)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n6. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card\n\n**Consumable:**\nThe Empress: Enhances 2 cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need 20,000 chips total and have 4 hands to do it. My best strategy is to play Flushes since my jokers are optimized for them.\n\nLooking at my current hand:\n- 2 Spades: 6, 4\n- 3 Hearts: King (Lucky), 9, 8\n- 2 Clubs: 7, 3\n- 1 Diamond: Jack\n\nI have 3 Hearts, which is the most of any suit. I should discard to try to get more Hearts for a flush.\n\n\nI should consider using The Empress on cards that will appear frequently in my flush plays. Since Hearts are my target suit with 16 remaining in the deck, I'd want to enhance even-ranked Hearts to maximize Even Steven's bonus. The King of Hearts is tempting despite being odd-ranked because of its Lucky Card potential, but an even Heart like the 8 would give me both the Mult boost and the Even Steven synergy.\n\nLet me work through what a typical flush scores without any enhancements to establish a baseline—base chips from the hand itself, plus the chip bonuses from Crafty Joker, 8 Ball, and the individual card values.\n\nFor mult, I'm looking at the base 10, plus Droll Joker's +10, Gros Michel's +15, and Even Steven triggering on a couple even cards for +8 total. That gives me around 43 mult, which multiplied by roughly 245 chips yields about 10,500 per hand. Over 4 hands, that's enough to hit the 20,000 chip goal.\n\nBut I should optimize my hand composition first—I need to discard strategically to draw more Hearts and build toward a stronger flush. Since Hearts is my strongest suit with 16 cards remaining, I should focus The Empress on those. The 8 and 9 of Hearts are better targets than the King since they're more likely to appear multiple times during scoring. I'll enhance positions 4 and 5.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,4,5]"}
