{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $0\n- Jokers: Crafty Joker (+80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush)\n- No consumables\n\n**Blind Options:**\n\n1. **Small Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 800\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Tag for skipping: Polychrome Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n\n2. **Big Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 1200\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Tag for skipping: Boss Tag (Rerolls the Boss Blind)\n\n3. **Boss Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 800\n   - Boss Description: Play only 1 hand\n   - Reward: $5\n\n**My Current Capabilities:**\n\nI have a Level 2 Flush (50 base chips, 6 base mult) and Crafty Joker (+80 chips for Flushes).\n\nLet me estimate what I can score with a Flush:\n- Base chips from Flush: 50\n- Crafty Joker bonus: +80\n- Total base chips: 130\n- Base mult: 6\n\nIf I play a 5-card Flush, each card adds its rank value to chips:\n- Let's assume I get decent cards (say, average of 7 per card for 5 cards = 35 chips from cards)\n- Total chips: 130 + 35 = 165 chips\n- Mult: 6\n- Total: 165 × 6 = 990 chips\n\nThis is enough to beat the Small Blind (800) but might be close. However, I should be able to achieve this consistently.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n1. **Play Small Blind**: \n   - I can likely beat this (need 800 chips)\n   - Get $3 reward\n   - Continue normally\n\n2. **Skip Small Blind for Polychrome Tag**:\n   - This tag makes the next base edition shop Joker free and Polychrome\n   - Polychrome edition gives x1.5 mult\n   - This could be very valuable, especially if I can get a good joker for free with Polychrome\n   - I'd go straight to Big Blind decision\n\n**Should I skip?**\n\nThe Polychrome Tag is quite valuable. A free Polychrome joker could provide a significant power spike, especially early in the run. However, I'd need to beat the Big Blind (1200 chips) next, which is tougher than the Small Blind. The $3 reward from playing Small Blind might be worth securing now rather than risking it for a tag that depends on shop luck. Facing the Boss Blind with just one hand is extremely risky given my limited resources. Playing the Small Blind instead gives me $3 to spend in the shop, which could let me grab The Fool to level up my Flush further or save toward a Greedy Joker. That money and the chance to strengthen my deck before hitting the Big Blind feels more practical than gambling on a single powerful hand against the Boss.","action":"\"play_round\""}
