{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n4. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n5. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n6. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n8. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n\n**Suits:**\n- Spades: Queen, Jack, 5, 3 (4 cards!)\n- Hearts: 7 (1 card)\n- Clubs: Queen, 4 (2 cards)\n- Diamonds: 9 (1 card)\n\n**Goal:** Need 22,000 chips\n**Remaining hands:** 4\n**Remaining discards:** 2\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always (+1 chip from foil = 51 chips)\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +72 Chips currently (2 chips per remaining card, 36 cards in deck)\n\n**Boss Effect:** Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n\nI have 4 Spades! I just need 1 more Spade to make a flush. There are 9 Spades remaining in the deck out of 36 cards total.\n\nI should discard one non-Spade card and hope to draw a Spade. My best options are to discard the lowest value cards that aren't Spades:\n- 7 of Hearts (+7)\n- 4 of Clubs (+4)\n\n\n- 9 of Diamonds (+9)\n\nWith only 2 discards left, I need to be careful. If I discard one card, I have a 9/36 (25%) chance of drawing a Spade. Playing a pair of Queens would be far less valuable than completing the flush. Let me work out what the flush would actually score with my Joker setup.\n\nA flush gives 95 chips and 12x multiplier. Adding the card values—Queen, Jack, 5, 3, plus another Spade—gets me around 28 chips from cards alone. My Jokers contribute significantly: Crafty Joker adds 80, 8 Ball adds 51, and Blue Joker adds 72, totaling 298 chips before card values. With the Droll and Gros Michel multipliers stacked on top of the base 12x, I'm looking at roughly 37x multiplier overall. Even at 326 chips times 37, that's only about 12,000—nowhere near the 22,000 I need.\n\nLooking back at that earlier hand that scored over 20,000, something must have been different. The Blue Joker was worth more chips then because there were more cards left in the deck. With 46 cards remaining it gave +92, but now with 36 cards it's only +72. Even accounting for that 20-chip swing, the math still doesn't add up. I'm clearly misunderstanding something fundamental about how the multipliers work—whether they're stacking additively or multiplicatively changes everything. Let me try a different approach. I should just attempt the flush since I'm only one Spade away with four hands remaining. Discarding a non-Spade card gives me roughly a 25% chance of hitting, which seems worth the risk given how few chips a pair of Queens would generate. I'll discard the 4 of Clubs and see if I can complete it.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [7]"}
