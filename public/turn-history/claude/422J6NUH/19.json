{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $2\n- Just beat Small Blind (needed 800 chips, scored 4,394)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker - +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n2. Droll Joker - +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Delayed Gratification - Earn $2 per discard if no discards are used by end of the round - $4\n2. Jumbo Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards - $6\n3. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - $4\n4. Clearance Sale voucher - All cards and packs 25% off - $10\n5. Reroll - $5\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- Money: $2\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 2)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0)\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nMy flush strategy is working extremely well. I just scored 4,394 chips on a hand that only needed 800. I now have two jokers that synergize perfectly with flushes:\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips on flush\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult on flush\n\nWith only $2, I can't afford any of the shop items:\n- Delayed Gratification costs $4\n- Jumbo Celestial Pack costs $6\n- Standard Pack costs $4\n- Clearance Sale costs $10\n- Reroll costs $5\n\n**Next Challenges:**\nI've beaten the Small Blind (Ante 2, Round 2). The next blinds will be:\n- Big Blind: Will need around 1200 chips (approximately 1.5x the Small Blind)\n\n\n- Boss Blind: Will need around 1600 chips but with special conditions\n\nSince I can't purchase anything with my current funds, I should move forward to the next blind. I'll gain money from interest on my $2 and $1 per remaining hand after beating the blind. My flush synergies are strong enough to handle the Big Blind comfortably, so proceeding to round_select is the right call.\n\nI've confirmed there's no other viable option—cards are too expensive, rerolling costs $5, and selling a joker would only give me $4 total while compromising my strategy since both jokers activate on the same flush condition.","action":"\"round_select\""}
