{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Chips Needed: 2000 (Small Blind)\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Money: $3\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n3. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n6. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n7. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n8. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n\n**Suit Distribution:**\n- Hearts: 4 cards (10, 9, 5, 3)\n- Spades: 2 cards (Ace, 6)\n- Clubs: 1 card (9)\n- Diamonds: 1 card (9)\n\n**Rank Distribution:**\n- 9s: 3 cards (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds)\n- Others: singles\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n3. 8 Ball (Foil): +100 chips, 1 in 4 chance for each played 8 to create Tarot card\n\n**Strategy:**\nI have a Flush-focused build. I need 5 cards of the same suit to make a Flush.\n\nCurrent options:\n1. **Four Hearts (10, 9, 5, 3)** - Not enough for a Flush\n2. **Three of a Kind with 9s** - I have 9 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds\n\n\n3. **Discard strategy** - If I remove the Spades and two 9s, I have a 34% chance per draw to hit another Heart from the remaining 15 in the deck, giving me decent odds of completing the Flush within my 4 remaining discards. Playing three 9s would give me a Three of a Kind, but that doesn't trigger my Flush-dependent Jokers. Flush Level 3 gives 65 base chips and 8 mult. Adding Crafty Joker (+80 chips) and 8 Ball (+100 chips) gets to 245 chips before card values. The five Hearts would contribute roughly 27 additional chips, reaching around 272 total. With Droll Joker pushing mult to 18, that's 272 × 18 = 4896+ chips—well above the 2000 threshold.\n\nI'll discard the four non-Heart cards (Ace of Spades, 6 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds) to maximize chances of drawing more Hearts and completing the Flush.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
