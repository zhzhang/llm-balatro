{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 10\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $6\n\n**Big Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 16,500\n- Reward: $4\n- Skip Tag: Polychrome Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n\n**Upcoming Boss Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Boss Effect: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +108 Chips (always active)\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n2. The Sun: Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts\n\n**Current Scoring Power:**\nWith my flush build, I can score approximately:\n- Base: 95 chips, 12 mult (Level 5 Flush)\n- Cards played (5 cards @ ~7 each): +35 chips\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips (if Flush)\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult (if Flush)\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Blue Joker: +108 chips\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n\nTotal: 95 + 35 + 80 + 50 + 108 = 368 chips × (12 + 10 + 15) = 368 × 37 = 13,616 chips per flush\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n\n\nThe Big Blind needs 16,500 chips—I can hit this with two flushes since 13,616 × 2 = 27,232. The Boss Blind is trickier since face-down card draws make flush construction unpredictable, but my suit conversion consumables give me flexibility to adapt and still build the hands I need.\n\nSkipping the Big Blind for the Polychrome Tag isn't worth it. I'd lose the $4 reward, miss out on interest from additional hands, and face the Boss Blind without a shop visit to strengthen my deck. My current build is solid enough to handle the Big Blind, so I'll play it, collect the money, and use the shop to prepare for the final challenge.\n\nLet me verify my scoring potential. A typical flush scores around 368 chips with my current setup—base 95 plus card values, Crafty's 80-chip boost, 8 Ball and Blue Joker contributions, and multiplier from Droll and Gros Michel stacking to 37x. This should comfortably exceed the 16,500 chip requirement.","action":"\"play_round\""}
