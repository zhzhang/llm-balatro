{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $0\n- Current Blind: Big Blind (7,500 chips needed, $4 reward)\n- Next Blind: Boss Blind (20,000 chips needed, $5 reward, \"Extra large blind\")\n- Tag for skipping Big Blind: Foil Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: Played cards with even rank give +4 Mult when scored\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 4 (80 base chips, 10 base mult)\n\n**Last Played Hand:**\n- Flush - 9,920 chips (Ante: 4, Blind: Small Blind)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me calculate my expected scoring power with a flush:\n\nBase Flush (Level 4): 80 chips, 10 mult\n\nWith 5 cards played in a flush (assuming all are even ranks for maximum Even Steven bonus):\n- Base chips: 80\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips = 160 chips total\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips = 210 chips total\n- Each card adds its chip value (let's assume average of 8 chips per card): 5 × 8 = 40 chips = 250 chips total\n\n\n- Base mult: 10\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult = 20 mult\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult = 35 mult\n- Even Steven: 5 cards × +4 mult = +20 mult = 55 mult total\n\nTotal score: 250 × 55 = 13,750 chips\n\nThis comfortably covers the Big Blind's 7,500 requirement. However, the Boss Blind needs 20,000 chips, and my current setup only reaches about 13,750. I'd need to either find additional multipliers or enhance my scoring somehow to meet that threshold.\n\nThe real question is whether to skip the Big Blind for the Foil Tag. A free foil joker with +50 chips is tempting, but I'd lose the $4 reward I need for shop purchases. Since I can already beat the Big Blind comfortably, the $4 becomes crucial for upgrading my deck before facing the Boss Blind.","action":"\"play_round\""}
