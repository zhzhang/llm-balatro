{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $2\n- Current Jokers:\n  1. Crafty Joker - +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n  2. Droll Joker - +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Blind Select Decision:**\nI need to decide whether to:\n1. Play the Big Blind (1200 chips needed, reward $4)\n2. Skip the Big Blind (get Boss Tag that rerolls the Boss Blind)\n\n**Upcoming Boss Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Boss Description: Play only 1 hand\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Boss Blind is much more challenging than normal - I can only play 1 hand. This means I need to score at least 800 chips in a single hand.\n\nLet me calculate what I can score with my current setup on a flush:\n- Base chips from Flush (Level 2): 50\n- Crafty Joker bonus: +80 chips\n- Total base chips before cards: 130 chips\n\nIf I play 5 cards in a flush, let's say they average around 7 chips each:\n- 130 + (5 * 7) = 165 chips\n- Base mult from Flush (Level 2): 6\n- Droll Joker bonus: +10 mult\n- Total mult: 16\n- Total score: 165 * 16 = 2,640 chips\n\nThat's way more than the 800 needed! Even with worse cards, I should easily clear it.\n\nHowever, the Boss Tag would let me reroll the Boss Blind if I don't like the boss effect. The current boss effect \"Play only 1 hand\" is actually manageable for me since I can score so many chips with a single flush.\n\n\nPlaying the Big Blind nets me $4 and I can comfortably hit 1200 chips with my flush combo. Skipping it means I lose that money but gain the flexibility to reroll the Boss Blind if needed. Since my current setup already crushes the one-hand restriction, I don't really need the reroll option.","action":"\"play_round\""}
