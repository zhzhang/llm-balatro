{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $18 (just received $15 from skipping the Big Blind)\n- Jokers: \n  1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n  2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n  3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n- Flush Level: 4 (80 base chips, 10 base mult)\n\n**Current Blind: Boss Blind**\n- Chips Needed: 4,000\n- Boss Effect: Must play 5 cards\n- Reward: $5\n- Cannot skip boss blinds\n\n**My Flush Scoring Power:**\nWith my Level 4 Flush and jokers:\n- Base chips: 80\n- Base mult: 10\n- Playing 5 cards of same suit (estimating ~37 chips from the cards themselves)\n- Total chips before jokers: 80 + 37 = 117 chips\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips = 197 chips\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips = 247 chips\n- Total mult: 10 (base) + 10 (Droll) = 20 mult\n- Final score: 247 × 20 = 4,940 chips\n\nThis is well above the 4,000 chip requirement.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe boss blind requires me to play 5 cards, which actually works perfectly for my Flush build since a flush requires exactly 5 cards of the same suit. My previous performances show I've consistently scored well with Flushes:\n- Last Flush: 4,176 chips (Ante 3, Small Blind)\n\n\n- Earlier runs: 4,394 chips (Ante 2, Small Blind), 3,348 chips (Ante 2, Boss), 2,704 chips (Ante 2, Big Blind)\n\nAll of these demonstrate I can reliably exceed the 4,000 chip threshold. Since boss blinds can't be skipped and `play_round` is my only option, I'll proceed with the hand.","action":"\"play_round\""}
