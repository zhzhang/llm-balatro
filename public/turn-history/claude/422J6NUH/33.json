{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $11\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers:\n  1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n  2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 2/5)\n- Owned Consumables: None\n- Max Consumables: 2\n\n**Shop:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Crazy Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Straight. Cost: $4\n  2. Erosion: +4 Mult for each card below 52 in your full deck (Currently +0 Mult). Cost: $6\n- Boosters:\n  1. Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards. Cost: $4\n  2. Buffoon Pack: Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards. Cost: $4\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Reroll Surplus: Rerolls cost $2 less. Cost: $10\n- Current Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm on Ante 3, which means the chip requirements are about to increase significantly. My current strategy is heavily focused on Flush hands - I have two jokers that synergize with Flushes, and I've leveled Flush to level 3.\n\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- Last played hand (Boss): Flush - 3,348 chips\n- Previous hands were also Flushes with good scores\n\nMy current build is very focused on Flushes, which is working well. Let me consider my options:\n\n1. **Crazy Joker ($4)** - Gives +12 Mult for Straights. This doesn't synergize with my Flush strategy.\n\n\n2. **Erosion ($6)** - Provides scaling through deck reduction, but requires building a smaller deck and doesn't directly support my Flush focus.\n3. **Arcana Pack ($4)** - Tarot cards could enhance my existing cards or provide utility.\n4. **Buffoon Pack ($4)** - Offers a chance to find a joker that complements my Flush synergies better than what I currently have.\n5. **Reroll Surplus ($10)** - Would give me more flexibility in future shops, though it leaves me with minimal funds afterward.\n6. **Reroll Shop ($5)** - Provides access to different shop options.\n\nWith $11 available and my Flush strategy performing well, the Buffoon Pack seems most promising. It's affordable at $4 and gives me a shot at finding a joker that works better with my current approach. Buying it leaves me with $7 for future opportunities, which feels more sustainable than committing most of my money to Reroll Surplus. I'm leaning toward this choice, though I should double-check if there's something I'm overlooking.\n\nThe Arcana Pack could enhance individual cards significantly—making them bonus, multiplier, wild, glass, or steel versions would strengthen my Flush considerably. But jokers offer permanent value that's harder to pass up. The Buffoon Pack's flexibility in finding a better joker synergy outweighs the temporary boost from card enhancements. I'll go with the Buffoon Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
