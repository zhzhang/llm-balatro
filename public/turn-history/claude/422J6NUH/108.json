{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Chips needed: 22,000\n- Current chips: 17,020\n- Chips still needed: 22,000 - 17,020 = 4,980\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\nAll 8 cards are unknown (flipped face down)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +46 Chips currently (2 chips per remaining card, 23 cards in deck)\n\n**Deck composition (23 cards remaining):**\n- Hearts: 12 cards (52.2%)\n- Diamonds: 5 cards (21.7%)\n- Spades: 4 cards (17.4%)\n- Clubs: 2 cards (8.7%)\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\n- Pair - 4,810 chips (most recent)\n- Flush - 12,210 chips\n- Flush - 20,406 chips\n\nI need 4,980 more chips with 2 hands remaining. The average I need per hand is 2,490 chips.\n\nLooking at my last hand, I played a Pair which scored 4,810 chips. Before that, flushes scored 12,210 and 20,406.\n\nSince all cards are face down, I'm playing blind. I have no information about what I'm holding. The key is to:\n1. Play enough cards to maximize my chances of hitting a good hand\n2. Given that Hearts are 52% of the remaining deck, there's a good chance I have multiple Hearts\n3. My flush jokers (Crafty and Droll) are powerful when I hit a flush\n\n\n4. With 8 cards drawn from a deck where Hearts comprise over half, I'd expect roughly 4-5 Hearts in my hand. Playing 5 cards gives me a reasonable shot at a flush, especially since Hearts dominate the remaining deck at 52%.\n\nThe actual probability of drawing 5 Hearts in sequence is quite low—around 3.6%—but it's still my best option given the card distribution. Since I'm uncertain about my exact hand composition, playing 5 cards and banking on a Hearts flush seems like the optimal strategy.\n\nIf the flush hits, the payout would be substantial: starting with 95 chips and a 12x multiplier, adding roughly 35 chips from the cards themselves, plus bonuses from Crafty Joker (+80), 8 Ball (+50), and Blue Joker (+46) would push the total significantly higher. the full hand to maximize my odds of hitting a flush or pair. Playing all five cards gives me the best shot at landing either outcome, since a pair alone might not provide enough cushion above the 4,980 threshold.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
