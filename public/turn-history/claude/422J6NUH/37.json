{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $3\n- Max Jokers: 5, Currently have: 3/5 (room for 2 more)\n- Max Consumables: 2, Currently have: 0/2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n3. 8 Ball (Foil): +100 chips, 1 in 4 chance for each played 8 to create a Tarot card\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Crazy Joker ($4): +12 Mult for Straights - doesn't fit my Flush strategy and I can't afford it\n- Erosion ($6): +4 Mult per card below 52 in deck (currently +0) - can't afford it\n- Reroll Surplus ($10): Can't afford it\n- Current Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Strategy Assessment:**\nI just used The Sun tarot card to convert 3 cards to Hearts, improving my Flush consistency. I'm running a Flush-focused strategy with:\n- Flush at Level 3 (65 base chips, 8 base mult)\n- Jokers giving +80 chips and +10 mult for Flushes\n- 8 Ball giving +100 chips (foil edition)\n\nMy recent Flush plays have been scoring 2,704 - 4,394 chips, which is strong for Ante 2.\n\n**Available Options with $3:**\n1. Do nothing and proceed to round_select\n2. I cannot afford any cards ($4 minimum)\n3. I cannot afford to reroll ($5)\n\nSince I have only $3 and everything costs more than I have, my only realistic option is to proceed to the next round. I should use the `round_select` command to move on.\n\n\nWith $3 in hand, none of the available purchases are within reach—the cheapest card costs $4 and rerolling requires $5. There are no boosters available either. Moving forward to round selection is the only viable path.","action":"\"round_select\""}
