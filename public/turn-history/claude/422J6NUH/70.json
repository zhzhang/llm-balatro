{"reasoning":"Let me analyze this critical situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 8\n- At BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Boss Blind requiring 20,000 chips\n- Current money: $2\n- Boss Description: \"Extra large blind\" - this is a straightforward boss with no special mechanics, just a higher chip requirement\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush  \n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, creates Tarot cards from 8s\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card\n\n**Consumable:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 4 (80 chips base, 10 mult base) - my primary strategy\n\n**Analysis of Chip Generation:**\nLooking at my recent flushes:\n- Flush - 9,867 chips (Ante 4, Big Blind)\n- Flush - 9,920 chips (Ante 4, Small Blind)\n- Flush - 4,940 chips (Ante 3, Boss)\n\nI need 20,000 chips for this boss blind. Let me calculate what I can expect from a typical flush:\n\nBase from hand type: 80 chips, 10 mult\nCrafty Joker: +80 chips (if flush)\n8 Ball: +50 chips\nDroll Joker: +10 mult (if flush)\nGros Michel: +15 mult\nEven Steven: +4 mult per even-ranked card (so if I have 2-3 even cards, that's +8 to +12 mult)\n\nLet's say I play 5 cards of the same suit to make a flush, with 2 even-ranked cards:\n\n\n- Card values contribute roughly 50 chips total\n- This gives me 260 chips combined (80 base + 80 Crafty + 50 from 8 Ball + 50 from cards)\n- Multiplier stacks to 43x (10 base + 10 Droll + 15 Gros Michel + 8 Even Steven)\n- That yields approximately 11,180 chips, still falling short of the 20,000 needed\n\nI'm only getting half my previous round's output. Using The Empress to boost 2 cards with +4 mult each would push my multiplier to 51x, giving me 13,260 chips—better, but I'd need multiple successful flushes to hit my target. Skipping means losing the $5 reward and postponing this boss fight without additional preparation time.\n\nI can't activate The Empress during the blind selection phase anyway—I need to wait until the round starts to enhance cards in my hand. My best path forward is to play through this round, strategically using The Empress on high-value cards I'll score repeatedly in my flushes, then execute multiple strong hands to reach the chip threshold.","action":"\"play_round\""}
