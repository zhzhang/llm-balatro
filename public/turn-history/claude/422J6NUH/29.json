{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss Description: Play only 1 hand\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Remaining hands that can be played: 1\n- Remaining hands that can be discarded: 3\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n2. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n3. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Flush Level:** Level 3 (65 base chips, 8 base mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\nAfter my first discard, I now have:\n- Spades: 9, 3 (2 cards)\n- Hearts: Jack, 9, 8 (3 cards)\n- Diamonds: King, 6, 2 (3 cards)\n\nI still don't have a 5-card flush. I have 3 discards left. Let me think about my options:\n\nOption 1: Continue trying for a Hearts flush\n- Keep: Jack of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts (3 cards)\n- Discard: 9 of Spades, 3 of Spades, King of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, 2 of Diamonds (5 cards)\n- Deck has 13 Hearts remaining out of 39 cards\n\n\n- I need 2 more Hearts from my next 5 cards drawn, which is a reasonable probability.\n\nOption 2: Try for a Diamonds flush\n- Keep: King of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, 2 of Diamonds (3 cards)\n- Discard: 9 of Spades, 3 of Spades, Jack of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts (5 cards)\n- Deck has 10 Diamonds remaining out of 39 cards\n- I need 2 more Diamonds from 5 cards drawn.\n\nHearts is the stronger play since there are more cards available (13 vs 10 remaining).\n\nOption 3: Try for a Spades flush\n- Keep: 9 of Spades, 3 of Spades (2 cards)\n- This would require drawing 3 more Spades, which is much harder\n- Only 8 Spades remaining in deck.\n\nHearts flush is clearly the best option. I'll discard the non-Heart cards and keep the three Hearts. If I complete the flush, I'll get 65 base chips from the flush, 80 from the Crafty Joker, plus roughly 45 chips from the card values themselves, totaling around 190 chips.\n\nWith the base mult of 8 and the Droll Joker adding 10 more, I'd have 18 total mult, giving me 190 × 18 = 3,420 chips—well above the 800 threshold. Without the flush, I'd be stuck with a high card or pair worth maybe 50-60 chips, nowhere near enough. So I need to go for it and discard the Spades and the 6.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,7,8]"}
