{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 9\n- In the SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $9\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots filled)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (both slots filled with The Moon and Jupiter)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for played 8 to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult (with 1/6 destruction chance)\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n2. Jupiter: Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips) - Already at Level 4\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  - Banner: +30 Chips per remaining discard ($5)\n  - Red Card: +3 Mult per skipped booster pack ($5)\n- Boosters:\n  - Jumbo Buffoon Pack: Choose 1 of 4 Jokers ($6)\n  - Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards ($6)\n- Vouchers:\n  - Overstock: +1 card slot in shop ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm heavily focused on Flush strategy, which has been working very well. My last few hands scored:\n- 9,828 chips (Flush)\n- 11,938 chips (Flush)\n- 9,867 chips (Flush)\n\nI have Jupiter which can level up my Flush hand to Level 5, which would increase it from 80 chips/10 mult to 95 chips/12 mult.\n\n\nWith $9 available, I could activate Jupiter immediately to boost my Flush without spending money, or I could invest in shop items like Banner or Red Card if I sell a Joker first. The Jumbo packs would require freeing up space, but Jupiter offers instant value since Flush is clearly my strongest hand. Activating it now would free up a consumable slot while strengthening my primary scoring engine.\n\nAfter using Jupiter, I'd have $9 left and an open slot, making the Jumbo Arcana Pack viable for $6. Cards like The Hanged Man or Death could provide useful utility. However, The Moon doesn't align with my Hearts-focused Flush strategy, so I should sell it first before committing to Jupiter.","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
