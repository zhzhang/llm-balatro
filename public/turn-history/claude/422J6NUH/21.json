{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades - +10 chips\n2. 10 of Spades - +10 chips\n3. Ace of Hearts - +11 chips\n4. Jack of Hearts - +10 chips\n5. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n6. Queen of Clubs - +10 chips\n7. 10 of Clubs - +10 chips\n8. 7 of Clubs - +7 chips\n\n**Goal:** Need 1200 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n- Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n- Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Resources:**\n- 4 hands remaining\n- 4 discards remaining\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need to look for flushes since both my jokers boost flush hands.\n\nLet me check what I have by suit:\n- Spades: King, 10 (2 cards)\n- Hearts: Ace, Jack, 7 (3 cards)\n- Clubs: Queen, 10, 7 (3 cards)\n\nI don't have a flush right now (need 5 cards of the same suit). I only have 3 Hearts and 3 Clubs.\n\nLooking at the deck info:\n- Diamonds: 13 cards remaining\n- Hearts: 13 cards remaining\n- Clubs: 7 cards remaining\n- Spades: 11 cards remaining\n\nI should discard to try to draw into a flush. Since I have 3 Hearts and Hearts has 13 cards remaining in the deck (the most along with Diamonds), I should keep the 3 Hearts and discard everything else to try to draw 2 more Hearts for a flush.\n\nAlternatively, I have 3 Clubs and there are 7 Clubs remaining.\n\nLet me calculate probabilities:\n\n\nHearts is the stronger option since I'd be drawing 5 cards from a pool where 13 of 44 remaining cards are Hearts, giving me better odds of completing the flush compared to Clubs where only 7 of 44 cards remain. I'll keep my three Hearts and discard the Spades and Clubs to maximize my chances of drawing the two additional Hearts I need. I need to go with the flush approach. Discarding cards 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 gives me the best shot at hitting the hand I need.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,6,7,8]"}
