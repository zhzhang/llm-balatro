{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Chips needed: 22,000\n- Current chips: 12,210\n- Chips still needed: 22,000 - 12,210 = 9,790\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 1\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Unknown (flipped face down)\n2. Unknown (flipped face down)\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n4. Unknown (flipped face down)\n5. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. Unknown (flipped face down)\n7. Unknown (flipped face down)\n8. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n\nSo I have 5 unknown cards and 3 known cards (7 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds).\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +60 Chips currently (2 chips per remaining card, 30 cards in deck)\n\n**Deck composition:**\n- Clubs: 3 cards\n- Diamonds: 5 cards\n- Hearts: 15 cards\n- Spades: 7 cards\nTotal: 30 cards\n\nThe boss effect means cards are drawn face down after each hand played. Since I can't see most of my cards, I need to make strategic decisions.\n\nMy last flush scored 12,210 chips, which was less than expected. I need 9,790 more chips with 3 hands remaining.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies:\n\n1. **Discard the unknown cards**: I have 1 discard left. I could discard some unknown cards to try to get better cards, but I won't be able to see what I draw.\n\n\n2. **Play what I have**: I could play the known cards and some unknown cards, hoping to hit something good.\n3. **Use my consumable**: I have Venus which levels up Three of a Kind. This doesn't seem immediately useful unless I happen to have three of a kind.\n\nWith 5 hidden cards and needing roughly 3,263 chips per hand on average, my approach hinges on what those unknown cards might be. Since Hearts dominate the remaining deck at 50%, there's a decent chance some of my face-down cards are Hearts, which could set up another Flush for my Crafty and Droll Jokers.\n\nThe other suits break down as Spades (23%), Diamonds (17%), and Clubs (10%), so I'm less likely to draw those. I already see 7 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, and 9 of Diamonds in my hand. If I'm aiming for a flush, I should discard cards that don't match my target suit to maximize my odds. But here's the catch—the boss mechanic draws cards face down after each hand, so I can't actually see what I'm working with for the remaining two hands.\n\nSince I need nearly 10,000 more chips and have limited visibility into my deck, I should focus on playing strategically with what I know. Discarding the unknown cards won't help since replacements will also be hidden. My best approach is to either commit to playing all five cards hoping for a flush among the unknowns, or play a partial hand using my visible cards and hope the unknowns complement them.\n\nGiven that the deck is 50% Hearts and I have the 7 of Hearts showing, discarding the Queen of Clubs and 9 of Diamonds to draw new cards gives me a chance at building a Hearts flush. If several of my hidden cards are Hearts, this could yield the high-scoring hand I need to close the gap.\n\nI realize I only have one discard remaining after this, so I need to be decisive. Playing five unknown cards is risky—the odds of them forming a flush are slim. My best approach is to discard the non-Heart cards I can see, keep the 7 of Hearts, and rely on the probability that my unseen cards contain enough Hearts to complete a strong hand.\n\nI'll discard the Queen of Clubs and 9 of Diamonds in positions 5 and 8.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,8]"}
