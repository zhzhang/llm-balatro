{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Blind: Small (5000 chips needed)\n- Money: $2\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 4\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n6. 7 of Hearts Lucky Card (+7 chips, 1 in 5 for +20 mult, 1 in 15 for $20)\n7. Ace of Diamonds Steel Card (+11 chips, x1.5 mult while in hand)\n8. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need 5000 chips to beat this Small Blind. I'm running a Flush build with Level 4 Flush (80 base chips, 10 base mult).\n\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Spades: Ace, Jack, 5 (3 cards)\n- Hearts: 9, 7, 7 (3 cards)\n- Diamonds: Ace (Steel), Jack (2 cards)\n\n\n- I can't form a flush right now, so I need to discard strategically. The Empress is a permanent deck enhancement, so I should consider using it on high-value cards I'll want in future flushes rather than waiting. Since it provides +4 mult per card, applying it to my strongest cards like the Aces or Jacks would maximize my flush scoring potential going forward.\n\nLooking at my deck composition, Hearts dominate with 16 cards, making them my most reliable suit for flushes. I should prioritize enhancing Heart cards to ensure they're played together frequently. However, my current hand only has 3 Hearts available, which limits my immediate options.\n\nI need to rebuild my hand strategically. Since I have 3 Spades, 3 Hearts, and 2 Diamonds, I'm far from a flush. I'll discard the Spades and Diamonds to focus on drawing more Hearts, keeping my three Heart cards and discarding the Ace of Spades, Jack of Spades, 5 of Spades, and Ace of Diamonds to work toward a Hearts flush.\n\nWait—the Ace of Diamonds has a Steel enhancement that multiplies my score by 1.5 while it stays in hand. That's too valuable to throw away. I should keep it and instead discard the Jack of Diamonds along with the three Spades, which gives me four discards to work with.\n\nNow I need to check if this setup can actually reach 5000 chips. With a Hearts flush, I'm looking at 80 base chips and 10 mult from the hand itself. My Jokers add significant value: Crafty Joker contributes 80 chips, 8 Ball adds 50, Droll Joker gives 10 mult, and Gros Michel provides 15 mult. The Steel Card multiplies everything by 1.5. Even with a five-card flush using the Hearts I have plus two more from the deck, my chip total would only reach around 245-250 before multipliers, and my mult sits around 35 before applying the x1.5 boost.\n\nThat gives me roughly 12,862 chips—well above the threshold. I could use The Empress to push the multiplier even higher, but I should discard first to see what additional cards become available, then decide if I need that extra boost.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,8]"}
