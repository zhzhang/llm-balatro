{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (just beat Small Blind)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $9\n- Jokers: 3/5 slots (Crafty Joker, Droll Joker, 8 Ball foil)\n- Consumables: 0/2\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI'm running a Flush-focused build with:\n- Crafty Joker: +80 Chips for Flush\n- Droll Joker: +10 Mult for Flush  \n- 8 Ball (Foil): +50 chips, chance to create Tarot cards from 8s\n- Flush is Level 3: 65 base chips, 8 base mult\n\nMy recent performance has been strong - just scored 4,176 chips on a 2,000 chip blind.\n\n**Shop Analysis:**\n\n**Jokers Available:**\n1. Throwback (Uncommon, $6): X0.25 Mult per skipped blind (currently X1.5). Since I haven't skipped any blinds, this is at X1 right now. Not great for my build.\n2. Ride the Bus (Common, $6): +1 Mult per consecutive hand without scoring face card. This could be okay but doesn't synergize directly with my Flush strategy.\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Arcana Pack ($4): Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards. Could be useful for deck manipulation.\n2. Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6): Choose 1 of 5 Planet cards. Could level up Flush further!\n\n**Vouchers:**\n1. Reroll Surplus ($10): Reduces reroll cost by $2. Too expensive for my current budget.\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 3,000 chips needed\n\n\n- Boss Blind: 4,000 chips needed (Must play 5 cards)\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack stands out since leveling my Flush would directly strengthen my core strategy. The Arcana Pack is cheaper and leaves more flexibility, but investing in my primary hand seems more valuable right now given how well Flush has been performing.\n\nI could also reroll to hunt for better jokers that complement Flush, or simply bank the $9 for later rounds. However, with the Boss Blind requiring exactly 5 cards—which aligns perfectly with my Flush setup—upgrading that hand now would make the upcoming high-chip blinds much more manageable. The Jumbo Celestial Pack at $6 gives me 5 Planet cards to choose from, and I should be able to select Venus to level up Flush. This feels like the strongest path forward for my current build.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
