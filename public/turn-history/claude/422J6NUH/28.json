{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss Description: Play only 1 hand\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Remaining hands that can be played: 1\n- Remaining hands that can be discarded: 4\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n4. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n6. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n7. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n8. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Flush Level:** Level 3 (65 base chips, 8 base mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI need to score 800 chips with only 1 hand. I have a Flush-focused build.\n\nLooking at my hand:\n- Spades: Ace, 10, 7 (3 cards)\n- Hearts: Jack, 9, 8 (3 cards)\n- Clubs: Queen, 9 (2 cards)\n\nI don't have a natural flush in hand (need 5 cards of same suit). However, I have 4 discards available!\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should discard to try to get a flush. Let me think about which cards to keep and which to discard.\n\nIf I want a Spades flush, I should keep: Ace of Spades, 10 of Spades, 7 of Spades\n\n\nIf I want a Hearts flush, I should keep: Jack of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts\n\nChecking the remaining deck composition: Hearts has 13 cards left compared to Spades' 10, giving me better odds of completing a Hearts flush. I'll discard the non-Heart cards and keep the three Hearts to draw toward a complete flush. a reasonable chance of drawing more Hearts to complete the flush.\n\nIf I successfully make a Hearts flush, the Crafty Joker and Droll Joker multipliers combined with the base flush chips would easily exceed 800. Even accounting for the card values, I'm looking at well over 3,000 chips. The real question is whether the flush attempt fails—if I don't draw enough Hearts after the discard, I'd be stuck with a weaker hand.\n\nWithout discarding, my options are severely limited. I can't form pairs, straights, or anything better than a high card, which would only yield around 16 chips. That's nowhere close to the 800 chip threshold. So discarding the non-Heart cards is my only viable path forward. I'll discard the Ace of Spades, 10 of Spades, 7 of Spades, Queen of Clubs, and 9 of Clubs to maximize my chances of completing a flush.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,7,8]"}
