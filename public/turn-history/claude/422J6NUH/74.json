{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- Boss Blind requiring 20,000 chips\n- Current chips: 11,938\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Money: $2\n\n**Chips needed:** 20,000 - 11,938 = 8,062 chips\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n2. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n6. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n7. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\nI have 4 Hearts: King, Queen, 8, 3. I need 5 cards to make a flush.\n\nWith 10 Hearts remaining in 36 cards, if I discard 4 non-Hearts, I'll draw 4 cards with a chance to get at least one more Heart.\n\nLet me check what hands I could make:\n- Hearts: King, Queen, 8, 3 (4 cards)\n- Spades: 8, 3 (2 cards)\n- Clubs: 9 (1 card)\n- Diamonds: 7 (1 card)\n\nI should discard the non-Hearts (Spades, Clubs, Diamonds) to try to get one more Heart for a flush.\n\n\nA flush at Level 4 gives 80 chips and 10 multiplier. If I complete the flush with a fifth Heart, I'd get the base 80 chips plus 80 from Crafty Joker and 50 from 8 Ball, totaling at least 210 chips before card values. The face cards and even-ranked cards would push this higher, but I need to verify this gets me close to the 8,062 chip gap.\n\nFor multipliers, I have the base 10, plus 10 from Droll Joker, 15 from Gros Michel, and 4 each from Even Steven for the even-ranked cards in the flush. That's 43 total multiplier, which applied to around 241 chips would exceed 10,000 chips—enough to reach my 20,000 target.\n\nBut looking back at my last hand, I scored 11,938 chips from a flush, so let me trace through what actually happened there to understand the exact scoring.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,8]"}
