{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $10\n- Next blind is the Boss Blind requiring 22,000 chips\n- Boss Effect: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +108 Chips (currently)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Juggler: +1 hand size - $4\n2. The High Priestess: Creates up to 2 random Planet cards - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Overstock: +1 card slot in shop - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 5 (95 chips, 12 mult) - This is my main strategy\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult) - Just upgraded\n- Everything else is mostly Level 1\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\n- Flush - 20,406 chips (with lucky card triggering)\n- Three of a Kind - 1,890 chips\n- Multiple flushes scoring 9,000-12,000 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need 22,000 chips for the boss blind. My last flush scored 20,406 chips when the lucky card triggered, which is close but not quite enough. Without the lucky trigger, my flushes score around 13,000 chips, which means I'd need at least 2 flushes.\n\n\nThe face-down card mechanic on this blind severely limits my ability to build flushes after the first hand, which threatens my entire strategy. With my remaining $10, I could grab Juggler and The High Priestess for $7, or pair either card with a reroll, or invest in the Jumbo Arcana Pack for $6. Each option trades off between improving my hand construction and having flexibility to adapt.\n\nJuggler gives me an extra card in my starting hand, pushing me to 9 cards and improving my odds of hitting a flush before the face-down cards become a problem. The High Priestess offers planet cards that might include Neptune for flush enhancement, but it's unreliable and I'm already holding The Moon. The Jumbo Arcana Pack is too expensive relative to what I need right now. Since I'm already close to my chip target, maximizing my first hand's strength with Juggler seems most direct.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
