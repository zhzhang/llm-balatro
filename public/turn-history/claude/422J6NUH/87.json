{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 10\n- In BUFFOON_PACK phase (choosing from a Jumbo Buffoon Pack)\n- Money: $5\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots full)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Wee Joker: +16 Chips (scales with 2s)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Blue Joker: +2 Chips per card in deck (Currently +108 Chips)\n2. Delayed Gratification: $2 per discard if no discards used\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even rank card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy strategy has been heavily Flush-focused with Level 5 Flush being my most played hand type (11 times). Looking at the choices:\n\n1. **Blue Joker (+108 chips)**: This is a solid chip boost that's always active. It would add 108 chips to every hand I play. Combined with my existing jokers, this could help push my flush scores higher.\n\n2. **Delayed Gratification ($2 per discard)**: This is more of an economy joker. Not really helpful for scoring.\n\n3. **Zany Joker (+12 mult for Three of a Kind)**: I only played Three of a Kind twice, and my build is Flush-focused. This doesn't fit my strategy.\n\n4. **Even Steven (+4 mult per even card)**: This could be interesting. In a 5-card flush, if I play cards like 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, that's potentially +20 mult. \n\nEven Steven's value fluctuates based on which cards I draw, making it unreliable compared to Blue Joker's consistent boost. Let me estimate scoring improvements: with Blue Joker, a typical flush would gain roughly 108 chips across the board, pushing my current ~10,400 score significantly higher. Even Steven might add 15-20 mult on good hands, but that's conditional on card draws. I'm at max jokers (5 total), so I can't add another without selling one first. I need to decide whether to skip the booster entirely—losing the $6 spent—or sell a joker to make room. Looking at candidates: Crafty Joker and Droll Joker are essential to my flush strategy, 8 Ball gives consistent +50 chips with foil, Gros Michel adds +15 mult, and Wee Joker is still being evaluated.\n\nBlue Joker would give +108 chips, which beats both Wee Joker (+16) and 8 Ball (+50) individually. The trade-off is between 8 Ball—which has foil value and tarot generation—versus Wee Joker, which has growth potential but is currently only at +16 chips and needs scoring to scale further.\n\nWee Joker would need 11-12 more 2s to reach Blue Joker's level, which seems unrealistic given the remaining game state. I should swap Wee Joker for Blue Joker.\n\nBut I should also consider Even Steven. With my flush-focused strategy and a deck that's roughly 50% even-ranked cards, I'd typically play 2-3 even cards per flush, yielding +8 to +12 multiplier. Let me evaluate whether that's competitive with the other options.\n\nEven at 3 even cards, Even Steven gives me a score around 13,769, while Blue Joker reaches 14,393. Blue Joker's advantage is its consistency—it doesn't rely on which specific cards I draw. I'll go with Blue Joker and sell Wee Joker.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
