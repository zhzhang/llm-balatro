{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $0\n- I have 5 jokers (max 5 - at capacity!)\n- I have 1 consumable (The Empress)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: Played cards with even rank give +4 Mult when scored\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Judgement (Tarot): Creates a random Joker card - $3 (but I'm at max jokers!)\n- Jumbo Standard Pack - $6\n- Magic Trick voucher - $10\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 4 (80 base chips, 10 base mult) - My main strategy\n- Straight Flush: Level 2 (140 base chips, 12 base mult)\n\n**Current Money: $0**\n\nI have no money left after buying Even Steven. My options are:\n1. Use The Empress to enhance 2 cards to Mult Cards\n2. Rearrange jokers if needed\n3. Proceed to round select\n\nSince I have $0, I cannot buy anything else from the shop. I should consider:\n\n1. Whether to use The Empress now or save it for later\n2. Whether my joker order matters\n3. Whether I should proceed to the round\n\nLet me think about The Empress:\n\n\nThe Empress is a permanent enhancement that adds +4 Mult to two cards. I should hold off using it until I can see my actual hand and identify which cards appear most frequently in my flushes—that way I can maximize the multiplier boost. Joker order matters since effects trigger sequentially from left to right, so my Crafty and Droll Jokers will activate first when I hit a flush, followed by the other effects.","action":"\"round_select\""}
