{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $11\n- I have 4 jokers (max 5)\n- Running a Flush build with Level 4 Flush (80 base chips, 10 base mult)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Shortcut (Joker): Allows Straights to be made with gaps - $7 (not useful for Flush build)\n- Mad Joker: +10 Mult if Two Pair - $4 (not useful for Flush build)\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Magic Trick (Voucher): Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Recent Progress:**\nI just bought a Mega Standard Pack and selected:\n- 6 of Clubs (with Planet card generation ability when held)\n- 2 of Clubs (Foil, +52 chips)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $11 remaining. The shop still doesn't have anything that directly benefits my Flush strategy:\n- Shortcut is for Straights\n- Mad Joker is for Two Pair\n\nMy options:\n1. **Buy Standard Pack ($4)** - Could get more suited cards, leaving me with $7\n2. **Buy Magic Trick ($10)** - Would let me buy playing cards later, leaving me with $1\n3. **Reroll Shop ($6)** - Might find better jokers or planet cards, leaving me with $5\n\n\n4. **Round Select** - Move on to the next round with $11\n\nSince I've already invested in deck building and have a solid Flush foundation, I should reroll the shop for $6. This gives me a shot at finding Planet Jupiter or other Flush-synergy jokers that would meaningfully upgrade my hand. If the reroll doesn't yield anything worthwhile, I can still proceed to the next round with $5 remaining.\n\nLet me calculate my current scoring ceiling: with my Flush at Level 4 providing 80 base chips, plus roughly 40-60 from card values, my Crafty Joker and 8 Ball adding 130 chips combined, I'm looking at around 250-290 total chips. My multiplier sits at 35 from the Flush base, Droll Joker, and Gros Michel. That puts my potential score in the 8,750-10,150 range, which should be competitive for this round.\n\nHowever, I'm progressing through Ante 4 out of 8, so I need to think about whether my current setup scales well enough for the remaining rounds. The reroll seems worth pursuing to find either a Planet card to push my Flush higher or additional Jokers that synergize with my flush-heavy strategy. I'll take the reroll.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
