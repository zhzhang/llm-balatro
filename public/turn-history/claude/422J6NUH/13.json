{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the current game state and select the best planet card from the 5 options available.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n- I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase\n- I have Crafty Joker which gives +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n- I have $0 left\n- I need to select 1 of 5 planet cards\n\nAvailable Planet Cards:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n2. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips\n3. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips\n4. Mercury - Level up Pair +1 Mult and +15 chips\n5. Jupiter - Level up Flush +2 Mult and +15 chips\n\nMy Hand Performance History:\n- Flush - 402 chips (best performance)\n- Three of a Kind - 189 chips\n- Pair - 90 chips\n\nCurrent Hand Levels:\n- Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4\n- Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 10, Base Mult 2\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 3\n\nAnalysis:\n\nJupiter (Flush) is the obvious choice here because:\n1. I have Crafty Joker that synergizes with Flushes (+80 chips)\n2. I've already successfully played a Flush in the previous round (402 chips)\n3. Leveling up Flush will increase it from Level 1 (35 chips, 4 mult) to Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n4. Flushes are relatively easy to form - just need 5 cards of the same suit\n5. The combination of leveled Flush + Crafty Joker will be very powerful\n\nOther options don't make sense:\n\n\n- High Card lacks consistency and power\n- Four of a Kind and Straight Flush are too difficult to assemble reliably\n- Pair is simple to trigger but offers minimal scoring even when upgraded\n\nThe Flush upgrade pairs perfectly with my Crafty Joker, creating a strong synergy. A Level 2 Flush generates 50 base chips plus 80 from the Joker, totaling 130 chips before multipliers and card values—a solid foundation heading into Ante 2.\n\nCommand: select 5","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
