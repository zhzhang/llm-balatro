{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Boss Blind)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $5\n- Boss Blind: \"Play only 1 hand\" to score 800 chips\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Inventory:**\n- Jokers:\n  1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n  2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n- Consumables: None\n- Hand Level: Flush Level 3 (65 base chips, 8 base mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe Boss Blind requires me to score 800 chips in only 1 hand. I cannot skip boss blinds, so I must play this round.\n\nLet me calculate my expected score with a Flush:\n- Flush base (Level 3): 65 chips, 8 mult\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips (if Flush)\n- 5 cards played in a Flush (assuming average ~9 chips each): +45 chips\n- Total chips: 65 + 80 + 45 = 190 chips\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult (if Flush)\n- Total mult: 8 + 10 = 18 mult\n- Total score: 190 × 18 = 3,420 chips\n\nThis is well above the 800 chip requirement. My previous Flush plays scored:\n- 2,704 chips (Big Blind)\n- 4,394 chips (Small Blind)\n- 402 chips (Boss from Ante 1)\n\nEven my lowest Flush score of 402 chips (from Ante 1 when Flush was Level 1) is not far below 800, and now my Flush is Level 3. \n\nI need to ensure I draw the right cards to complete a Flush since I only get one attempt. My Flush-heavy strategy has consistently performed well, and with my current Joker setup, I should comfortably exceed the 800 chip threshold. I'll proceed with the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
