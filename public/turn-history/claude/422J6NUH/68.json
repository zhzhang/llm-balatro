{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (choosing from a Celestial Pack)\n- Current Money: $2\n- Next blind will be the Boss Blind for Ante 4\n\n**Pack Choices:**\n1. Pluto: Level up High Card (+1 Mult, +10 chips)\n2. Mercury: Level up Pair (+1 Mult, +15 chips)\n3. Earth: Level up Full House (+2 Mult, +25 chips)\n\n**My Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 4 (80 chips, 10 mult) - MOST PLAYED (8 times)\n- High Card: Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Pair: Level 1 (10 chips, 2 mult) - Played 1 time\n- All other hands at Level 1\n\n**My Strategy:**\nLooking at my last played hands, I've been primarily playing Flush hands:\n- Flush - 9,867 chips (most recent)\n- Flush - 9,920 chips\n- Flush - 4,940 chips\n- Flush - 4,176 chips\n- Flush - 3,348 chips\n- Flush - 2,704 chips\n\nMy joker setup is heavily optimized for Flush:\n- Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n- Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n- 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n- Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n- Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card\n\n**The Problem:**\nUnfortunately, none of the three planet cards offered upgrade Flush! This is disappointing since I was hoping to find a Pluto card (which would level up Flush, not High Card). \n\nNone of these options directly support my Flush-focused strategy. Since I've already paid for this planet pack, I need to choose one of the three rather than skip it entirely. Looking at what's available, I should consider which hand type might serve as a useful secondary option if I'm forced to play something other than Flush during the remaining rounds.\n\nHigh Card appears most practical since I've already played it once for 1,040 chips when I couldn't form a Flush. Leveling it up would improve those unavoidable situations. Pair is simpler to construct but still weak, while Full House requires a specific combination I've never needed and seems unlikely to come up. Given that I sometimes fall back on High Card when Flush isn't possible, that's probably my best choice here.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
