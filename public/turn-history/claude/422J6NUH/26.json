{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Boss Blind coming up)\n- Money: $5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Flush is now Level 3 (65 base chips, 8 base mult) - just upgraded with Jupiter\n- Two jokers: Crafty Joker (+80 chips for Flush) and Droll Joker (+10 mult for Flush)\n- No consumables left\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Rough Gem (Joker) - $7 - Too expensive\n2. Seance (Joker) - $6 - Too expensive (and doesn't fit my strategy)\n3. Standard Pack - $4 - Could buy this\n4. Clearance Sale Voucher - $10 - Too expensive\n5. Reroll - $5 - Would spend all my money\n\n**Boss Blind Analysis:**\nI'm about to face the Boss Blind. Based on previous turns, I've been consistently scoring well with Flushes:\n- Last Flush scored 2,704 chips against Big Blind\n- Another Flush scored 4,394 chips against Small Blind\n\nWith my upgraded Flush (now Level 3), my scoring should be even better:\n- Flush base: 65 chips, 8 mult\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult\n- Playing 5 cards in a flush with average ~9 chips each: +45 chips\n- Total chips: 65 + 80 + 45 = 190 chips\n- Total mult: 8 + 10 = 18 mult\n- Total score: 190 × 18 = 3,420 chips\n\nThis is a very strong score for Ante 2. Boss Blinds typically require around 800-1200 chips at this stage.\n\n\nThe Standard Pack for $4 could add suit-specific cards to improve Flush consistency, but my current setup already performs well enough. Spending all $5 on a reroll seems wasteful since the expensive jokers won't become affordable anyway, and my existing joker combination is solid.\n\nI'll skip both purchases and keep my $5 for the next shop. My Level 3 Flush is generating 3,000+ chips consistently, which should be sufficient for the Boss Blind ahead. Preserving capital gives me better options later rather than gambling on marginal improvements now.","action":"\"round_select\""}
