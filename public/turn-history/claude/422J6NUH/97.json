{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- Need to prepare for Boss Blind requiring 22,000 chips\n- Boss Effect: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +108 Chips (currently)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n2. The High Priestess: Creates up to 2 random Planet cards\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Juggler: +1 hand size - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Overstock: +1 card slot in shop - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $7 remaining. My options are:\n1. Buy Juggler for $4 (leaves me with $3)\n2. Buy Jumbo Arcana Pack for $6 (leaves me with $1)\n3. Reroll for $5 (leaves me with $2)\n4. Use The High Priestess to create planet cards\n5. Go to round select\n\nLet me think about what I need:\n- My last flush scored 20,406 chips, which is just under the 22,000 needed\n- The boss blind makes cards face down after each hand, which severely limits flush construction\n- I need to maximize my first hand's scoring potential\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n1. \n\nBuying Juggler for $4 would give me an extra card in my opening hand—drawing 9 instead of 8. That's crucial since the face-down mechanic kicks in immediately, so my first hand is my best shot at a strong flush. The High Priestess is free to activate and could grant Neptune to boost my flush further, so I could use both. Rerolling seems less efficient since I'd spend $5 and still need to make a purchase.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
