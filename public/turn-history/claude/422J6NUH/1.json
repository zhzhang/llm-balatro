{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 0 - Still at the very start\n- Blind Select phase\n- I now have a Double Tag from skipping the Small Blind (as I planned)\n- Current money: $4\n- Current Blind: Big Blind requiring 450 chips, rewards $4\n- Tag for skipping: Charm Tag (gives free Mega Arcana Pack)\n\n**My Previous Strategy:**\nI skipped the Small Blind to get the Double Tag, with the intention of then skipping the Big Blind to get TWO Charm Tags (one from skipping Big Blind, plus one copy from the Double Tag). This would give me two free Mega Arcana Packs.\n\n**Options Now:**\n1. **Play the Big Blind** - Need 450 chips, reward $4, keep Double Tag for future use\n2. **Skip the Big Blind** - Get Charm Tag + another Charm Tag from Double Tag = 2 free Mega Arcana Packs\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me reconsider the strategy:\n\n**If I skip the Big Blind now:**\n- I get 2 Charm Tags → 2 free Mega Arcana Packs\n- I keep my $4\n- I move directly to the Boss Blind (600 chips needed)\n- Boss effect: \"Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\" - Since I haven't played any cards yet, this boss effect won't impact me at all!\n- I'll have powerful tarot cards to enhance my deck before facing the Boss\n- I won't have shopped yet, so I'll have $4 going into the Boss round\n- After beating the Boss, I'll get $5 + interest, giving me decent money for the first shop\n\n**If I play the Big Blind now:**\n- I need to beat 450 chips with a base deck\n- I'll earn $4, bringing me to $8\n\n\n- Then I can visit the shop and purchase upgrades\n- The Double Tag remains available for future rounds\n- However, any cards I use here will be debuffed when I face the Boss, since the Boss effect penalizes previously played cards\n\nThe critical factor is the Boss's debuff mechanic. Playing cards now means they'll be weakened later, whereas skipping lets me build up Mega Arcana cards first without any cards being affected by the debuff.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
