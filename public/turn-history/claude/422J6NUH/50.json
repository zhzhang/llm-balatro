{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $19\n- I'm running a Flush build with Level 4 Flush (80 base chips, 10 base mult)\n\n**My Jokers (4/5):**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**Current Scoring Potential:**\n- Base chips: 80 (Flush Level 4)\n- Card chips: ~37 (average for 5 cards)\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Total chips: ~247\n\n- Base mult: 10 (Flush Level 4)\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n- Total mult: 35\n\n- Final score: 247 × 35 = 8,645 chips\n\n**Shop Options After Reroll:**\nCards:\n1. Shortcut (Joker) - Allows Straights to be made with gaps of 1 rank - $7\n2. Mad Joker - +10 Mult if played hand contains Two Pair - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - $4\n2. Mega Standard Pack - $8\n\nVouchers:\n1. Magic Trick - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $6 (increased from $5)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Shortcut** - Not useful for my Flush build, I'm not playing Straights\n2. **Mad Joker** - Not useful for my Flush build, I'm not playing Two Pairs\n\n\n3. **Standard Pack ($4)** - Could add suited cards for consistency, though limited value\n4. **Mega Standard Pack ($8)** - Better odds with 2 cards from 5 options\n5. **Magic Trick ($10)** - Gives flexibility to buy playing cards later\n6. **Reroll ($6)** - Might surface better jokers or planet cards for my strategy\n\nThe shop didn't offer anything synergistic with my Flush focus. With $19 available and one joker slot remaining, I need to decide between investing in card consistency through a booster pack or rerolling for better joker options that could amplify my current setup.\n\nMy 8,645 chip score should comfortably beat Small and Big blinds but leaves little margin against Boss. The Mega Standard Pack seems like the safer play—it directly strengthens my deck's ability to hit flushes consistently, which is my primary scoring engine. I'll grab it and head into the next round with $11 remaining.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
