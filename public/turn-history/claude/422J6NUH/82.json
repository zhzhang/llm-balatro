{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 9\n- In BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Money: $5\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots filled)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (1 slot filled with The Moon)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1/4 chance for played 8 to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult (1/6 chance to be destroyed at end of round)\n5. Wee Joker: Gains +8 Chips when each played 2 is scored (Currently +0 Chips) - RARE\n\n**Blind Options:**\n\n1. **Small Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 11,000\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Skip Tag: Boss Tag (Rerolls the Boss Blind)\n\n2. **Big Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 16,500\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Skip Tag: Polychrome Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n\n3. **Boss Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 22,000\n   - Boss Description: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n   - Reward: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy Flush strategy has been very successful, consistently scoring 9,000-12,000 chips at Ante 4. My current joker setup:\n- Base Flush (Level 5): 95 chips × 12 mult = 1,140 base\n- Plus card chips (avg ~35 chips from 5 cards) = ~130 total chips\n\n\n- Crafty adds 80 chips, 8 Ball contributes 50, Droll multiplies by 10, and Gros Michel by 15, giving me roughly 9,600 chips per hand. The Small Blind's 11,000 chip requirement should be achievable with my current setup.\n\n- Wee Joker hasn't contributed yet but will scale once I hit some 2s during play. My recent runs have consistently landed between 9,000-12,000 chips, so I'm in a solid position.\n\n- Skipping Small Blind grants a Boss Tag to reroll the Boss effect. The current effect—cards drawn face down—doesn't severely hamper my Flush strategy since I can still track suits. It's a manageable challenge.\n\n- Skipping Big Blind instead offers a Polychrome Tag, making the next shop Joker free and Polychrome-edition. That's a stronger reward since Polychrome multiplies by 1.5x, and a free premium Joker would meaningfully boost my scoring.\n\n- Playing Small Blind nets me $3, pushing my total to $8, which lets me accumulate interest and shop after Big Blind. I can comfortably exceed 11,000 chips with my current setup, and playing keeps Wee Joker's scaling potential alive. The Boss Tag isn't worth skipping since I can handle the current effect anyway.","action":"\"play_round\""}
