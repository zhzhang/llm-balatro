{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round 1\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $0\n- Jokers: Crafty Joker (+80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush)\n- Consumables: None\n- Hand Levels: Flush is now Level 2 (50 base chips, 6 base mult)\n\n**Shop Available:**\n1. The Fool (Tarot) - $3 - Creates Jupiter (Level up Flush). This is interesting but I have no money.\n2. Greedy Joker - $5 - Played Diamond cards give +3 Mult when scored\nShop Boosters: None\nVouchers:\n1. Clearance Sale - $10 - All cards and packs 25% off\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**My Money: $0**\n\nSince I have $0, I cannot buy anything from the shop. My only real option is to use `round_select` to finish shopping and move to the blind select phase.\n\nLet me think about whether there's anything else I could do:\n- Can't buy anything (no money)\n- Can't reroll (costs $5)\n- Can't use consumables (don't have any)\n- Can't sell jokers profitably (only have 1 joker that synergizes with my strategy)\n- Can't rearrange jokers (only have 1)\n\nThe logical action is to proceed to the round select phase with `round_select`.\n\nI should note that:\n1. My Flush is now Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n2. With Crafty Joker, playing a Flush will give me 50 + 80 = 130 base chips plus 6 mult\n3. This is a solid foundation for Ante 2\n\nThe best action is to use the `round_select` command to move forward.","action":"\"round_select\""}
