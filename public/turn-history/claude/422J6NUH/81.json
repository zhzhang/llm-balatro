{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 9\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $5\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all 5 slots filled)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (1 slot filled with The Moon)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1/4 chance for played 8 to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult (1/6 chance to be destroyed at end of round)\n5. Wee Joker: Gains +8 Chips when each played 2 is scored (Currently +0 Chips) - RARE\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n\n**Hand Levels:**\nFlush is Level 5: Base Chips 95, Base Mult 12\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  - Banner: +30 Chips per remaining discard ($5)\n  - Red Card: +3 Mult per skipped booster pack ($5)\n- Boosters:\n  - Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards ($6) - can't afford\n- Vouchers:\n  - Overstock: +1 card slot in shop ($10) - can't afford\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have exactly $5 left after buying the Jumbo Buffoon Pack and selecting Wee Joker. Now I need to decide what to do with this $5.\n\nMy options:\n1. Buy Banner for $5 - gives +30 chips per remaining discard\n2. Buy Red Card for $5 - scaling joker that gains +3 mult per skipped booster pack (starts at 0)\n\n\n3. Reroll the shop for $5\n4. Save the money and proceed to round select\n\nMy strategy is heavily focused on Flush hands. I've been consistently scoring 9,000-12,000 chips at Ante 4. Now at Ante 5, I'll need higher scores.\n\nBanner analysis: +30 chips per remaining discard. This is inconsistent since I don't always have leftover discards. When I do have leftover discards, it could add 30-90 chips (1-3 discards). This is a small boost compared to my current scoring.\n\nRed Card analysis: Starts at +0 mult and gains +3 mult per skipped booster pack. I've already skipped several packs, so this could provide meaningful scaling if I continue skipping boosters. However, the initial value is zero and growth depends on future decisions.\n\nRerolling could reveal better options, but I'm uncertain if anything more valuable will appear. Saving the money gives me flexibility for future rounds, though I'm at max joker capacity and limited consumable slots. Given my Flush-focused strategy and the marginal value of both cards, I should probably reroll to see if better options emerge. I don't need Banner or Red Card right now—Banner's chip boost is minimal compared to my current scoring power, and Red Card doesn't align with my pack-buying strategy. Proceeding to round select lets me keep the $5 for interest and maintain flexibility for future shops. My joker setup is solid for Ante 5, so I'll move forward and earn that $1 interest on my money.","action":"\"round_select\""}
