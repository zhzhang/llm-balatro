{"reasoning":"I'm in a booster pack selection phase where I need to choose one of three tarot cards. Let me analyze the options:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- About to face Boss Blind (Ante 2, Round 3)\n- Boss Blind only allows 1 hand and requires 800 chips\n- My strategy is focused on Flush hands (with Crafty and Droll Jokers)\n- Current Flush level: Level 2 (50 Base Chips, 6 Base Mult)\n- $5 remaining\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n\n1. **The Devil** - Enhances 1 selected card into a Gold Card\n   - Gold Cards give $3 when held in hand at end of round\n   - This is primarily a money generation card\n   - Doesn't directly help me beat the Boss Blind\n\n2. **The Fool** - Creates the last Planet card used (Jupiter)\n   - Jupiter levels up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips)\n   - This would give me another Jupiter to use, which would level up my Flush to Level 3\n   - Level 3 Flush would be: 65 Base Chips, 8 Base Mult\n   - This directly strengthens my main strategy\n\n3. **The Soul** - Creates a Joker (Must have room)\n   - I have room for 3 more jokers\n   - Random joker could be helpful, but it's uncertain\n   - Could be strong, could be weak\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFor the Boss Blind, I need to score 800 chips in ONE hand. Let me calculate my current potential:\n\nCurrent Flush (Level 2):\n- Base: 50 chips, 6 mult\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- Cards played (5 cards, avg ~9 chips each): +45 chips\n- Total chips: 50 + 80 + 45 = 175 chips\n\n\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult\n- Total mult: 6 + 10 = 16 mult\n- **Total score: 175 × 16 = 2,800 chips**\n\nI'm comfortably above the 800 chip threshold for this round. But future Antes will demand much higher scores, so The Fool's ability to upgrade my Flush to Level 3 becomes valuable for scaling. Upgrading to Level 3 would push my base to 65 chips and 8 mult, significantly improving my damage output for upcoming challenges.\n\nThe Fool creates the last Planet card used—which was Jupiter—giving me a consumable to apply later. This directly strengthens my primary hand and supports my progression strategy. The Devil mainly generates money, which isn't urgent, while The Soul offers unpredictable random jokers. The Fool's guaranteed Planet upgrade makes it the strongest pick for consistent scaling.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
