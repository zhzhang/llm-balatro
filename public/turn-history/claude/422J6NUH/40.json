{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n2. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n3. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n4. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n5. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n6. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n7. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**Situation:**\n- I have 7 Hearts and 1 Diamond\n- I need 2000 chips to pass the Small Blind\n- I have 4 hands and 3 discards remaining\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n3. 8 Ball (Foil): +100 chips base, 1 in 4 chance for each played 8 to create Tarot card when scoring\n\n**Flush Hand Analysis:**\nI can easily play a 5-card Flush with Hearts. Let me calculate the chips:\n\n**Option 1: Play 5 best Hearts (10, 9, 8, 5, 5)**\n- Base Flush chips: 65\n- Base Flush mult: 8\n- Cards in flush: 10 + 9 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 37 chips\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- 8 Ball (foil): +100 chips\n- Total chips before mult: 65 + 37 + 80 + 100 = 282 chips\n- Mult: 8 (base) + 10 (Droll Joker) = 18 mult\n\n\n- Total: 282 × 18 = 5,076 chips\n\nActually, I need to reconsider the scoring sequence. The Jokers trigger at different stages—'on played' effects happen before card scoring begins, while 'independent' Jokers activate after all cards have scored. This means the Crafty and Droll Jokers apply their bonuses before individual cards are evaluated, affecting the final multiplier calculation differently than I initially thought.\n\nLet me recalculate: The Flush Level 3 provides 65 base chips and 8 base mult. The five cards contribute 10 + 9 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 37 chips. The Crafty Joker adds 80 chips, the 8 Ball (foil) adds 50 chips, and the Droll Joker adds 10 mult. This gives me 232 total chips and 18 total mult, resulting in 232 × 18 = 4,176.\n\nSince this far exceeds the 2,000 chip threshold, I'm playing the highest-value hearts available: the 10, 9, 8, and both 5s in positions 1 through 5.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
