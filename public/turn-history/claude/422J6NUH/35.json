{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4 (in the Shop phase)\n- Money: $7\n- Max Jokers: 5, Currently have: 3/5\n- Max Consumables: 2, Currently have: 0/2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n3. 8 Ball (Foil): +50 chips base (+50 more from foil = +100 chips total), 1 in 4 chance for each played 8 to create a Tarot card\n\n**Strategy Assessment:**\nI'm heavily focused on Flush strategy with my first two jokers, and I've leveled Flush to level 3. My recent hands have been consistently scoring well with Flushes (3,348, 2,704, 4,394 chips). The 8 Ball adds a flat +100 chips boost which is solid.\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Crazy Joker ($4): +12 Mult for Straights - doesn't fit my Flush strategy\n- Erosion ($6): +4 Mult per card below 52 in deck (currently +0) - needs deck reduction strategy\n- Arcana Pack ($4): Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards to use immediately\n- Reroll Surplus ($10): Reduces reroll cost by $2 - I only have $7, can't afford this\n- Current Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith $7, my options are:\n1. Buy Arcana Pack ($4) - leaves me with $3\n2. Reroll the shop ($5) - leaves me with $2\n3. Buy nothing and proceed to round select\n\nThe Crazy Joker doesn't fit my build. Erosion could be interesting but requires me to reduce my deck size, which I haven't been doing, and it costs $6 which would leave me with only $1.\n\n\nThe Arcana Pack could provide immediate value—Tarot cards might enhance my Flush hands with bonus multipliers or card enhancements. But I'm already performing well with my current setup, scoring over 3,000 chips consistently. Since Ante 3 will demand higher chip thresholds, I need to evaluate whether a random Tarot card is worth $4 or if I should preserve resources for future rounds. Buying the Arcana Pack for $4 leaves me with $3, which is tight for future shops, but rerolling would cost $5 and leave me with even less. The tarot enhancements—particularly mult, bonus, or glass cards—would directly strengthen my Flush hands right now, making this a better use of my money than saving or rerolling.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
