I have 3 discards left. Let me think about my options:\\n\\nOption 1: Continue trying for a Hearts flush\\n- Keep: Jack of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts (3 cards)\\n- Discard: 9 of Spades, 3 of Spades, King of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, 2 of Diamonds (5 cards)\\n- Deck has 13 Hearts remaining out of 39 cards\\n\\n\\n- I need 2 more Hearts from my next 5 cards drawn, which is a reasonable probability.\\n\\nOption 2: Try for a Diamonds flush\\n- Keep: King of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, 2 of Diamonds (3 cards)\\n- Discard: 9 of Spades, 3 of Spades, Jack of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts (5 cards)\\n- Deck has 10 Diamonds remaining out of 39 cards\\n- I need 2 more Diamonds from 5 cards drawn.\\n\\nHearts is the stronger play since there are more cards available (13 vs 10 remaining).\\n\\nOption 3: Try for a Spades flush\\n- Keep: 9 of Spades, 3 of Spades (2 cards)\\n- This would require drawing 3 more Spades, which is much harder\\n- Only 8 Spades remaining in deck.\\n\\nHearts flush is clearly the best option. I'll discard the non-Heart cards and keep the three Hearts. If I complete the flush, I'll get 65 base chips from the flush, 80 from the Crafty Joker, plus roughly 45 chips from the card values themselves, totaling around 190 chips.\\n\\nWith the base mult of 8 and the Droll Joker adding 10 more, I'd have 18 total mult, giving me 190 \\u00d7 18 = 3,420 chips\\u2014well above the 800 threshold. Without the flush, I'd be stuck with a high card or pair worth maybe 50-60 chips, nowhere near enough. So I need to go for it and discard the Spades and the 6.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 31]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 4\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Crafty Joker.

Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips) - Steel Card: X1.5 Mult while this card stays in hand\\n\\n**My Jokers:**\\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\\n\\n**Flush Level:** Level 3 (65 base chips, 8 base mult)\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n\\nCurrent hand composition:\\n- Hearts: Jack, 9, 8, 4 (4 cards)\\n- Clubs: 7, 4, 3 (3 cards)\\n- Diamonds: Ace (Steel Card) (1 card)\\n\\nI need a 5-card flush to activate my jokers and get enough chips. I have 4 Hearts currently, so I need 1 more Heart to complete the flush.\\n\\nI have 2 discards remaining. If I discard the non-Hearts cards and try to draw one more Heart:\\n- Deck has 12 Hearts remaining out of 34 cards\\n- I need to draw 1 Heart from 4 cards drawn\\n\\n\\n- The odds are favorable for completing this.\\n\\nIf I discard the three Clubs and the Ace of Diamonds while keeping my four Hearts, I'd draw four new cards needing just one Heart among them. With 12 Hearts still in the deck out of 34 remaining cards, the probability of drawing at least one Heart is very high.\\n\\nBut I'm overlooking something crucial\\u2014the Ace of Diamonds is a Steel card that multiplies my score by 1.5 as long as it stays in my hand. That's a significant boost I shouldn't ignore. Instead of discarding it, I could keep it along with my Hearts and only discard the three Clubs, drawing three replacement cards. I'd still need one more Heart to complete the flush, and I'd gain that valuable multiplier bonus.\\n\\nIf this works out and I hit the flush, my calculation shifts: 65 base chips from the flush plus 80 from Crafty Joker plus roughly 38 from the five Hearts' chip values gives me 183 chips. With a base mult of 8 plus 10 from Droll Joker, then multiplied by 1.5 from the Steel Ace, I'm looking at 27 total mult\\u2014resulting in 4,941 chips. That's far beyond the 800 threshold. The real question is whether discarding the Steel card entirely might actually be better if the flush probability doesn't justify keeping it.\\n\\nWithout that x1.5 multiplier, I'd have 183 chips \\u00d7 18 mult = 3,294 chips, which still clears 800 comfortably. So the Steel Ace is a nice boost but not essential. I need to weigh whether the higher odds of completing the flush by discarding it outweigh losing that multiplier bonus\\u2014roughly a 72% success rate versus the guaranteed mult increase. Option 2 leaves me with 4 Hearts, Steel Ace, and 3 new cards\\u2014still no flush without that 5th Heart. Without the flush, my jokers don't trigger, so I lose the Crafty Joker's +80 chips and Droll Joker's +10 mult. A pair of 4s would only give around 50 chips total, nowhere near the 800 I need.\\n\\nThe flush is essential for activating my jokers. Option 1's 72% success rate beats Option 2's 60%, so I should discard all non-Hearts including the Steel Ace.

Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\\n2. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\\n3. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\\n4. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\\n5. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips) - Steel Card: X1.5 Mult while this card stays in hand\\n6. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\\n\\n**My Jokers:**\\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\\n\\n**Flush Level:** Level 3 (65 base chips, 8 base mult)\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n\\nCurrent hand composition:\\n- Hearts: Jack, 9, 8, 4 (4 cards)\\n- Diamonds: Ace (Steel Card), Jack, 9, 4 (4 cards)\\n\\nI still don't have a 5-card flush! I have 4 Hearts and 4 Diamonds.\\n\\nI have 1 discard remaining, and then I MUST play. This is critical.\\n\\nOption 1: Discard all Diamonds and try for Hearts flush\\n- Keep: Jack, 9, 8, 4 of Hearts (4 cards)\\n- Discard: Ace, Jack, 9, 4 of Diamonds (4 cards)\\n- Draw 4 new cards\\n\\n\\n- Need 1 Heart among them. With 12 Hearts remaining in a deck of 31 cards, I have roughly a 67% chance of drawing at least one Heart to complete the flush. If successful, the Crafty Joker adds 80 chips on top of the base 65 from the flush plus card values.\\n\\n- The total would reach around 176 + X chips (where X is the new Heart's value), multiplied by a base of 8 plus 10 from Droll Joker for 18x, then Steel Ace's 1.5x multiplier, giving approximately 4,752 + 27X chips.\\n\\n- But wait\\u2014if I discard the Steel Ace to make room for Hearts, I lose that 1.5x multiplier entirely, which significantly reduces the final score. I need to reconsider whether keeping the Ace is worth sacrificing the flush potential.\\n\\n- Alternative approach: keep the Jack, 9, 8, 4 of Hearts along with the Steel Ace, then discard the three non-Ace Diamonds. This way I draw 3 new cards needing just 1 Heart to complete the flush while preserving the Steel Ace's multiplier. The odds remain around 67% with 19 non-Hearts left in the 31-card deck.\\n\\n- I could also pursue a Diamonds flush instead by keeping the Ace, Jack, 9, 4 of Diamonds and discarding all Hearts. This requires 1 Diamond among 4 draws from the remaining 6 Diamonds in a 31-card deck, also roughly 45% probability. However, this path has a critical drawback\\u2014the Steel Ace would no longer provide its multiplier boost if I'm building around Diamonds instead.\\n\\nPlaying my current hand as Two Pair is another option. I have three pairs total (Jacks, 9s, and 4s), which counts as a Two Pair hand type with a base multiplier of 2. The chip calculation depends on which specific cards I select for the final hand.\\n\\nIf I play Jack-Jack-9-9, that gives me 38 chips from the cards themselves plus 20 base chips for Two Pair, totaling 58 chips. With Steel Ace in hand providing a x1.5 multiplier, the final score would be 58 \\u00d7 2 \\u00d7 1.5 = 174 chips\\u2014far short of the 800 I need.\\n\\nThis confirms I must pursue the flush. Comparing my realistic paths: going for Hearts by discarding all Diamonds gives me a 67.1% success rate but costs the Steel Ace multiplier, while keeping Steel Ace and discarding only 3 Diamonds drops my odds to 45.1% but preserves the multiplier. The Diamonds flush option also sits at 45.1% but would require playing Steel Ace, eliminating its bonus anyway.\\n\\nEven without Steel Ace, a Hearts flush would score around 3,168 chips\\u2014well above my target. With Steel Ace, it jumps to 4,752 chips. The first option's higher probability makes it the stronger play, though I should consider what happens if I fail to complete the flush.\\n\\nIf I don't hit the Hearts flush in option 1, I'm left with four Hearts and four random cards\\u2014likely just a pair worth roughly 116 chips, which falls short. In option 2, even with the Steel Ace multiplier still active, a two-pair would only reach about 174 chips, also insufficient. Since both failure scenarios result in losing, I need to prioritize the path with the best odds of success. Option 1 gives me a 67.1% chance versus option 2's 45.1%, so discarding all four Diamonds and drawing for a Heart is the right move.\\nCommand: discard 5 6 7 8\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 4\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Crafty Joker.
