{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss Description: Play only 1 hand\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Remaining hands that can be played: 1\n- Remaining hands that can be discarded: 0\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n2. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n4. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n5. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n6. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips) - Lucky Card: 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20\n7. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n8. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Flush Level:** Level 3 (65 base chips, 8 base mult)\n\nI have 0 discards left, so I MUST play now.\n\nLet me count the suits:\n- Spades: 1 card (4)\n- Hearts: 6 cards (Jack, 9, 8, 7, 7, 4)\n- Diamonds: 1 card (5)\n\nI have 6 Hearts! This means I can play a 5-card Hearts flush.\n\nThe best 5 Hearts to play would be:\n- Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n- 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n- 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n- 7 of Hearts (+7 chips) - Lucky Card\n\n\n- 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n\nI should select the five highest-value Hearts available: Jack, 9, 8, and both 7s give me the strongest base chips before my Joker multipliers kick in.\n\nThe Crafty Joker adds 80 chips on top of the Flush's 65-chip foundation, while my card values total 41. That puts me at 186 chips. My Droll Joker pushes my multiplier to 18, giving a final score of 3,348 chips before accounting for the Lucky Card's random chance at bonus multiplier.\n\nThat's comfortably above the 800-chip threshold. I need to select positions 2 through 6 to play my five Hearts: the Jack, 9, 8, and both 7s.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
