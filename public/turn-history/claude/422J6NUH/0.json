{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 0 - This is the very start of the game\n- At the Blind Select phase\n- Current Blind: Small Blind requiring 300 chips, rewards $3\n- I have $4 starting money\n- No jokers, no consumables yet\n- This is the first decision of the game\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Play the Small Blind** - Need 300 chips, reward $3\n2. **Skip the Small Blind** - Get Double Tag (gives a copy of the next selected tag, excluding Double Tag)\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 450 chips, skip gives Charm Tag (free Mega Arcana Pack), reward $4\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips, debuffs cards played previously this Ante, reward $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me think about whether to play or skip the Small Blind:\n\n**If I play the Small Blind:**\n- I need to reach 300 chips with my starting deck\n- With base hands and no jokers/consumables, this should be doable\n- I'll earn $3, bringing me to $7 total\n- Then I'll go to the shop and can buy something\n- I won't get the Double Tag\n\n**If I skip the Small Blind:**\n- I get a Double Tag\n- I keep my $4\n- I move directly to choosing whether to play/skip the Big Blind\n- If I skip the Big Blind next, I'd get TWO Charm Tags (one from skipping Big, one copy from Double Tag)\n- Two free Mega Arcana Packs could be very powerful early game\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n\nThe Double Tag → Skip Big Blind strategy is very powerful because:\n1. Double Tag copies the next tag I get\n2. Big Blind offers Charm Tag (free Mega Arcana Pack)\n3. So I'd get 2 free Mega Arcana Packs\n\n\n4. Tarot cards from these packs can enhance cards with powerful modifiers (Bonus, Mult, Wild, Glass, Steel, Stone, Gold, Lucky) or transform cards entirely, giving me significant deck improvements early on\n\nThe tradeoff is sacrificing $7 in blind rewards (skipping Small and Big) to get two free Mega Arcana Packs, leaving me with only $4 going into the Boss Blind. I need to weigh whether the early deck power from two Tarot packs outweighs having more money for shop purchases.\n\nIn Balatro, the compounding value of strong deck modifications early typically exceeds the short-term cash loss. The enhanced cards and transformations create a foundation that carries through the entire run, making the double-skip strategy worthwhile.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
