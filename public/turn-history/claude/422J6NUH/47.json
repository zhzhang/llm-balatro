{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n2. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n3. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n4. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n5. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n6. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Hearts in hand:** J♥, 9♥, 8♥, 8♥, 2♥ = **5 hearts!**\n\nThis is a flush! I have 5 hearts in hand.\n\n**Scoring Calculation:**\n- Boss requires playing 5 cards, so I'll play all 5 hearts\n- Base chips from Flush Level 4: 80\n- Card chips: 10 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 2 = 37\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n- Total chips: 80 + 37 + 80 + 50 = 247 chips\n\n- Base mult from Flush Level 4: 10\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult\n- Total mult: 10 + 10 = 20\n\n- Final score: 247 × 20 = 4,940 chips\n\nThis is well above the 4,000 chips needed!\n\nAdditionally, I have two 8s of hearts, which means the 8 Ball joker has a 1 in 4 chance per 8 to create a Tarot card (if there's room in consumables, which there is - I have 0/2 consumables).\n\n**Action:** I should play the 5 hearts (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to make a flush and win this round.\n\n\nConfirming the card positions: J♥, 9♥, 8♥, 8♥, and 2♥ are in slots 1 through 5, which is exactly what I need to select.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
