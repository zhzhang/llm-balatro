{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm at the BLIND_SELECT phase\n- This is the Boss Blind of Ante 1/8\n- I need 600 chips to pass\n- Boss effect: Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\n- I have $4\n- Reward for beating this blind: $5\n\n**My Inventory:**\n- No jokers yet\n- No consumables\n- No tags\n- No vouchers\n\n**Important Context from Previous Actions:**\nFrom the previous turns, I've been enhancing my deck:\n1. Turn 4: I enhanced my Ace of Diamonds into a Steel Card (x1.5 Mult while in hand)\n2. Turn 5: I enhanced King of Clubs and 7 of Clubs to Lucky Cards (1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult)\n3. Turn 6: I converted King of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, and 2 of Clubs to Hearts using The Sun tarot\n\nSo my deck should now contain:\n- Steel Ace of Diamonds (x1.5 Mult when held in hand)\n- Lucky King of Hearts (1 in 5 for +20 Mult)\n- Lucky 7 of Hearts (1 in 5 for +20 Mult)\n- 2 of Hearts (converted from Clubs)\n- Plus other standard cards\n\n**Hand Levels:**\nAll hands are at level 1 with base values. Flush is Level 1 with Base Chips 35 and Base Mult 4.\n\n**Boss Effect Analysis:**\nThe boss says \"Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\". Since I haven't played any cards yet this Ante (I'm at Round 0, and I've only been in tarot pack selection), this boss effect won't affect me at all in the first round!\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should play the round. The only available action is to play_round since I have no consumables or jokers to manage. \n\nOnce I draw cards, I can leverage my enhanced deck—the Steel Ace with its multiplier boost, the Lucky cards with their potential for bonus multipliers, and the Hearts conversion for flush opportunities—to accumulate the 600 chips needed across my available hands.","action":"\"play_round\""}
