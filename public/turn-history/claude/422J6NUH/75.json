{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- Boss Blind requiring 20,000 chips\n- Current chips: 11,938\n- Chips needed: 20,000 - 11,938 = 8,062 chips\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Money: $2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n5. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n6. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips) - **Creates the Planet card for final played poker hand of round if held in hand**\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\nI have 5 Hearts in hand! This is perfect for a flush: Ace, King, Queen, 8, 3.\n\nLet me calculate what I'd get from playing these 5 Hearts:\n\n**Base flush (Level 4):** 80 chips, 10 mult\n\n**Chips calculation:**\n- Base: 80 chips\n- Crafty Joker (flush bonus): +80 chips\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Card chips: Ace (11) + King (10) + Queen (10) + 8 (8) + 3 (3) = 42 chips\n\n\n- Total chips: 80 + 80 + 50 + 42 = 252 chips\n\n**Mult calculation:**\n- Base: 10 mult\n- Droll Joker (flush bonus): +10 mult\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n- Even Steven: The 8 of Hearts is even-ranked, so +4 mult\n- Total mult: 10 + 10 + 15 + 4 = 39 mult\n\nThis flush would score 252 × 39 = 9,828 chips, bringing my total to 11,938 + 9,828 = 21,766 chips—enough to beat the 20,000 chip requirement.\n\nI'll play the 5 Hearts in positions 1-5. The 6 of Clubs creates a Planet card when held during my final hand of the round, so keeping it along with the other cards in hand makes sense for the bonus.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
