{"reasoning":"I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK phase, where I need to choose 1 of 2 joker cards:\n\n1. The Idol - Each played 6 of Diamonds gives X2 Mult when scored. Card changes every round. (Uncommon)\n2. Crafty Joker - +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush. (Common)\n\nLet me analyze which one is better:\n\n**The Idol:**\n- Very specific requirement: Need to have a 6 of Diamonds AND need to play it\n- The card changes every round, so it's not consistently the 6 of Diamonds\n- X2 Mult is multiplicative, which is powerful, but very conditional\n- I'd need to specifically play the 6 of Diamonds in a hand\n- Since the target card changes each round, this is unreliable\n\n**Crafty Joker:**\n- Gives +80 Chips whenever I play a Flush\n- I've already played a Flush once (402 chips in my last round)\n- Flushes are relatively easy to build - need 5 cards of the same suit\n- +80 chips is a flat bonus, which is decent but not amazing\n- More consistent and easier to trigger than The Idol\n\nLooking at my previous performance:\n- I played a Flush for 402 chips\n- I played a Pair for 90 chips\n- I played a Three of a Kind for 189 chips\n\nThe Flush was my highest scoring hand. With Crafty Joker, that would have been 482 chips instead of 402 chips, which is a significant boost.\n\n**Decision:**\nCrafty Joker is more reliable and easier to build around. The Idol is too specific and changes every round, making it inconsistent. I should select Crafty Joker.\n\nI need to use the command: select 2\n\nThis will select the Crafty Joker (position 2).","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
