{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $2\n- I have 4 jokers (max 5)\n- I have 1 consumable (The Empress) out of max 2\n- Running a Flush build with Level 4 Flush (80 base chips, 10 base mult)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Egg (Joker): Gains $3 of sell value at end of round - $4 (can't afford)\n- Standard Pack: $4 (can't afford)\n- Magic Trick (Voucher): $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll Cost: $7 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith only $2 remaining, I cannot afford any of the items in the shop. My options are:\n\n1. **Sell something to buy something else** - But there's nothing in the shop worth buying right now. Egg is not useful for my Flush strategy, and I can't afford the Standard Pack or Magic Trick anyway.\n\n2. **Round Select** - Move on to the next round with $2 and The Empress consumable.\n\nSince I have The Empress in my inventory and there's nothing useful I can buy with my limited funds, the best move is to proceed to the next round. I'll use The Empress during the round to enhance two high-value cards that I frequently play in my Flushes, which will permanently boost my scoring potential.\n\n\nI'll move forward to the next round now.","action":"\"round_select\""}
