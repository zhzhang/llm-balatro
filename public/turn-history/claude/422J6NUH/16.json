{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Money: $0\n- Blind: Small (800 chips needed)\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20)\n4. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n5. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n6. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**My Joker:**\n- Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 6\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLet me check what hands I can make:\n- Pair of Kings (positions 2 and 3): King of Hearts x2\n- Flush: I need 5 cards of the same suit\n  - Hearts: 2, 3, 4 (only 3 cards)\n  - Clubs: 5, 6, 7 (only 3 cards)\n  - Spades: 1 (only 1 card)\n  - Diamonds: 8 (only 1 card)\n\nI cannot make a Flush with this hand, which is my strongest option with the Crafty Joker.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince I can't make a Flush now, I should discard cards to try to draw into a Flush. I have 4 discards available, so I can be strategic about this.\n\n\nTo build toward a flush, I need to focus on one suit. Hearts has 13 cards left in the deck compared to 7 for Clubs, so I should prioritize the three Hearts I'm holding. I'll discard the Spades, Diamonds, and the weaker Clubs to maximize my chances of drawing into a five-card Hearts flush. I need to weigh my options here. I have 3 Hearts and 3 Clubs, but Hearts gives me better odds with 13 cards left in the deck versus only 7 Clubs remaining. Plus, the Lucky King of Hearts could provide extra multiplier if I complete the flush. I'll discard the non-Heart cards in positions 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 to maximize my chances of drawing two more Hearts.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,5,6,7,8]"}
