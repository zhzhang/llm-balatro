{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- Next blind is the Boss Blind requiring 22,000 chips\n- Boss Effect: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +108 Chips (currently)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n2. Venus: Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Juggler: +1 hand size - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Overstock: +1 card slot in shop - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Key Points:**\n- The High Priestess created a Venus planet card (Three of a Kind) instead of a Neptune (Flush) card\n- I still have $7\n- My main strategy is Flush-based\n- I need 22,000 chips for the Boss Blind\n- The boss makes cards face down after each hand, making it hard to build flushes after the first hand\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy last flush scored 20,406 chips, which is close but just under 22,000. The face-down mechanic makes it critical to maximize my first hand.\n\nOptions:\n1. Buy Juggler for $4 - gives me +1 hand size (9 cards instead of 8), better chance of getting a flush in the first hand\n\n\n2. Buy Jumbo Arcana Pack for $6 - could provide useful tarot cards to strengthen my hand\n3. Reroll for $5 - hope for better shop offerings\n4. Skip shopping and proceed to the blind\n\nThe Venus card helps Three of a Kind but doesn't directly support my flush focus. Buying Juggler seems optimal since it costs only $4, leaves me with $3, and permanently expands my hand size to 9 cards—significantly boosting my odds of landing a flush on the opening hand when cards are still visible.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
