{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state and the booster pack choices.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm running a Flush build with Level 4 Flush\n- I have 4 jokers that support this strategy\n- I'm in a Mega Standard Pack selection phase (choose 2 of 5 cards)\n- I have $11 remaining\n- Currently at Ante 4/8, Round 6\n\n**My Strategy:**\nMy build is focused on playing Flushes with:\n- Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n- Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n- 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n- Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. **2 of Clubs** - +2 chips, Foil edition (+50 chips)\n2. **2 of Spades** - +2 chips, Bonus enhancement (+30 extra chips)\n3. **Stone Card** - +50 Chips, no rank or suit\n4. **6 of Spades** - +6 chips\n5. **6 of Clubs** - +6 chips, Creates Planet card for final played poker hand of round if held in hand\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFor my Flush build, I need:\n1. Cards that contribute to Flushes (same suit)\n2. Cards that add more chips when played\n3. Cards that have special abilities that help my strategy\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **2 of Clubs (Foil)**: Clubs suit, adds +2 base + 50 from foil = 52 chips. Foil edition is great for chip bonuses. Clubs suit helps if I'm building a Clubs flush.\n\n2. **2 of Spades (Bonus)**: Spades suit, adds +2 base + 30 from bonus = 32 chips. \n\nThe Spades option provides decent chip value and supports Spades flush builds. The Stone Card is problematic since it lacks a suit entirely, making it useless for forming flushes despite the chip boost. The 6 of Spades offers basic support for Spades flushes, while the 6 of Clubs has the added benefit of generating a Planet card when held, which could provide scaling for my final hand of the round.\n\nThe 6 of Clubs stands out as the strongest pick due to that Planet generation—it's a consistent way to level up my Flush hand type each round. Between the remaining options, the 2 of Clubs Foil edges out the 2 of Spades Bonus because of the +20 chip advantage, and it synergizes better with the 6 of Clubs I'm already selecting.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
