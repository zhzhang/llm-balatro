{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4 (early in Ante 3)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $3\n- Jokers: 3/5 slots filled (Crafty Joker, Droll Joker, 8 Ball foil)\n- Consumables: 0/2\n\n**My Build:**\nI'm running a Flush-focused strategy with:\n- Crafty Joker: +80 Chips for Flush\n- Droll Joker: +10 Mult for Flush  \n- 8 Ball (Foil): +100 chips base, chance to create Tarot cards from 8s\n- Flush is Level 3: 65 base chips, 8 base mult\n\n**Recent Performance:**\nMy last played hands show I've been consistently scoring well with Flushes:\n- 4,394 chips (Ante 2, Small Blind)\n- 2,704 chips (Ante 2, Big Blind)\n- 3,348 chips (Ante 2, Boss)\n\nI just used The Sun tarot to convert several cards to Hearts, improving my Flush consistency.\n\n**Current Blind Options:**\n\n1. **Small Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 2000\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Skip Tag: Uncommon Tag (free Uncommon Joker in shop)\n\n2. **Big Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 3000\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Skip Tag: Skip Tag (gives $5 per skipped blind this run, would give $15)\n\n3. **Boss Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 4000\n   - Boss Description: Must play 5 cards\n   - Reward: $5\n   - Cannot be skipped\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n\nMy Flush scores easily exceed the 2000 chip threshold needed for Small Blind. The real question is whether skipping for the Uncommon Tag makes sense—a free Uncommon Joker typically costs $6-7, but I'd forfeit the $3 reward, leaving me with just $3 in the shop versus $6 if I play and win. The value trade-off depends on what Uncommon Jokers are available and whether they synergize with my current build.\n\nThe Big Blind at 3000 chips is similarly manageable given my Flush performance. The Skip Tag would eventually pay $5 per skipped blind, but since I haven't skipped any yet, it contributes nothing now—so that's not a factor in this decision.\n\nPlaying the Small Blind makes the most sense. My Flushes consistently score well above 2000 chips, and the $3 reward brings me to $6 total, giving me purchasing power in the shop for tougher rounds ahead. While the Uncommon Joker from skipping is tempting, the extra money provides more flexibility. Plus, the Boss Blind's 5-card requirement actually suits my Flush strategy perfectly, so I'm positioned well to handle all three blinds this round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
