{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $24\n- Just bought Gros Michel joker\n\n**My Jokers (4/5):**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult, 1 in 6 chance destroyed at end of round\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Earth (Planet) - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 playing cards - $4\n2. Mega Standard Pack - Choose 2 of up to 5 playing cards - $8\n\nVouchers:\n1. Magic Trick - Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI'm running a very successful Flush build. My current scoring potential with the new Gros Michel:\n- Base chips: 80 (Flush Level 4)\n- Card chips: ~37 (average for 5 cards)\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Total chips: ~247\n\n- Base mult: 10 (Flush Level 4)\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n- Total mult: 35\n\n- Final score: 247 × 35 = 8,645 chips\n\nThis is much stronger than before. Now let me think about what to do next:\n\n1. **Earth** - Not useful, I don't play Full House\n\n\n2. **Standard Pack ($4)** - Could help add more suited cards to my deck\n3. **Mega Standard Pack ($8)** - Better value, 2 cards from 5 options\n4. **Magic Trick ($10)** - Allows buying playing cards from shop, but expensive\n5. **Reroll ($5)** - Could find better jokers or planet cards\n\nThe Mega Pack offers the best value for building my deck, and I have one joker slot left to fill. With Ante 4 approaching, I need stronger cards to meet the escalating chip requirements. My 52-card deck has solid suit distribution with 16 hearts, so adding more suited cards through the Mega Pack would strengthen my Flush consistency.\n\nFor Ante 4, I'm looking at roughly 5,000-6,000 chips for the Small Blind, 8,000-10,000 for the Big Blind, and 12,000-15,000 for the Boss. My current setup gets me to 8,645 chips, which covers the Small and possibly the Big, but the Boss will be tight. A Reroll for $5 might uncover a better joker or a planet card to level up my Flush further, which could be the multiplicative boost I need to comfortably clear the Boss Blind.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
