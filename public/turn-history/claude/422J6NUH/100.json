{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- I'm at the Boss Blind\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Boss Effect: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n- Current Money: $7\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +108 Chips (currently)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 selected cards to Clubs\n2. Venus: Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n\nFrom my last played hands, I can see that my last flush scored 20,406 chips in Ante 5, Big Blind. That's just under the 22,000 I need for this Boss Blind.\n\nThe Boss effect is critical: \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\". This means:\n- My first hand will have all cards visible\n- After I play my first hand, all newly drawn cards will be face down\n- This makes it extremely difficult to build flushes after the first hand\n\nGiven that my last flush scored 20,406 chips and I need 22,000, I'm about 1,600 chips short. \n\nLet me think about how to maximize my scoring:\n\n**For a Flush (Level 5):**\n- Base: 95 chips, 12 mult\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult\n- 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n\n\n- Blue Joker: +108 chips\n\nPlaying a 5-card flush would generate roughly 383 chips from the base hand plus joker bonuses (95 + 80 + 50 + 108 + ~50 from cards), multiplied by a total multiplier of 37x (12 base + 10 + 15). This gives me a solid foundation, though I need to verify if this reaches the 22,000 threshold.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the Blue Joker calculation depends on remaining deck size—it grants +2 chips per card left, so with 54 cards that's +108, but this changes after each hand is played. The scoring sequence matters too: cards trigger left-to-right, then independent jokers activate in order, which could significantly shift my final total.\n\nBreaking down the joker contributions: 8 Ball adds +50 chips with foil edition, Crafty Joker contributes +80 chips if I'm playing a flush, Gros Michel multiplies by an additional 15, and Droll Joker adds +10 mult for a flush as well. Blue Joker's chip boost fluctuates based on deck composition. If I play five high cards worth 10 chips each, I'm starting with 95 base chips plus the card values, then layering on these modifiers—but I need to verify the exact order these activate to avoid the miscalculation that gave me 14,171 instead of 20,406.\n\nThe Moon is the key here since it can shift up to 3 cards to Clubs, which guarantees I'll hit the flush requirement and unlock both Crafty and Droll's bonuses. I can't activate consumables during the blind selection phase, so I'll need to deploy The Moon once the round actually starts.","action":"\"play_round\""}
