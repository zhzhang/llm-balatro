{"reasoning":"I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK game step, which means I need to select one of the four Joker cards offered in the booster pack.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1/4 chance for played 8 to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult (always active)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Wee Joker (Rare): Gains +8 Chips when each played 2 is scored (Currently +0 Chips)\n2. Zany Joker (Common): +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n3. Credit Card (Common): Go up to -$20 in debt\n4. Crazy Joker (Common): +12 Mult if played hand contains a Straight\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy strategy is heavily focused on Flush hands. I've been playing Flush consistently (10 times played, Level 5) and scoring 9,000-12,000 chips per hand at Ante 4.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. **Wee Joker** - This is a Rare scaling Joker that gains +8 chips per played 2. This could be strong long-term, but it starts at 0 and requires playing 2s to scale. Since I play Flushes, I'd only score 2s when they're part of the flush. This is a scaling joker that could become powerful over time.\n\n2. **Zany Joker** - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind. This doesn't synergize with my Flush strategy at all. Not useful.\n\n3. **Credit Card** - Allows debt up to -$20. \n\nThis is a utility card that doesn't directly boost scoring. Not what I need right now.\n\n4. **Crazy Joker** - +12 Mult for Straight. Also doesn't synergize with Flush strategy. Not useful.\n\nThe only real choice here is Wee Joker. **Wee Joker Analysis:** It's Rare rarity, scales with played 2s, and while it starts at 0 chips, I'll naturally include 2s in my Flush hands over time. This could provide meaningful scaling as the ante progresses, even if I only occasionally hit 2s in my flush compositions.\n\nMy current jokers all offer fixed bonuses—Crafty gives +80 Chips, Droll provides +10 Mult, 8 Ball adds +50 chips, and Gros Michel grants +15 Mult. Wee Joker would be my first scaling joker, which means it could grow substantially stronger in later antes. The other options don't fit my Flush strategy at all, so Wee Joker's potential for growth makes it the clear pick despite its slow start. its chip value (let's say average of 7 chips per card = 35 chips)\n- Crafty: +80 chips\n- Droll: +10 mult\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n\nTotal: (95 + 35 + 80 + 50) = 260 chips × (12 + 10 + 15) = 260 × 37 = 9,620 chips\n\nThat's consistent with my 9,000-12,000 chip scores.\n\nFor Ante 5, the blinds will likely require around 15,000-25,000+ chips for Big and Boss blinds. I'm close but might need more power.\n\nWee Joker starting at 0 won't help immediately, but if I can build it up over several rounds, it could provide significant scaling as the ante progresses.\n\nComparing my options: Red Card only grants +3 mult per skipped pack and also starts at 0, making it a weaker scaling option overall. Wee Joker has better growth potential since I'm regularly playing 2s in my flush hands. The Rare rarity also suggests stronger inherent value. I'll go with position 1 and pick Wee Joker.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
