{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Chips Needed: 7,500\n- Current Chips: 1,040\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Spades - +9 chips\n2. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\n3. 7 of Hearts (Lucky Card) - +7 chips\n4. 3 of Hearts - +3 chips\n5. 3 of Clubs - +3 chips\n6. 4 of Diamonds - +4 chips\n7. 3 of Diamonds - +3 chips\n8. 2 of Diamonds - +2 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card when scored (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\n**What happened:**\nLooking at the last played hand, I played a \"High Card - 1,040 chips\" which means the three-card Spade flush from my previous action didn't work as expected. I only scored 1,040 chips, which is way less than the 10,148 I estimated. This is confusing - let me re-read the context.\n\nWait, I see the issue. My previous action estimated \"flush 10150\" but the result was \"High Card - 1,040 chips\". This means the cards I played (positions 1, 2, 3 which were Queen of Spades, 10 of Spades, 6 of Spades) did NOT form a flush! \n\n\nThe cards were all spades, so they should have formed a flush. But the game recorded it as \"High Card\". This is very strange. Actually, looking more carefully - I need to check what cards are currently in my hand. The current hand is completely different from the previous hand! So the game has already drawn new cards after I played my hand. I have 1,040 chips and still need 7,500 to clear this ante.\n\nI'm looking at my current hand and I see a pair of nines and three threes, which gives me a three of a kind. I also have potential for a flush with three hearts or three diamonds. With 3 hands remaining and 4 discards left, I should evaluate whether to play the three of a kind now or try to build something stronger by discarding strategically.\n\nThe three of a kind scores 39 base chips, boosted to 89 with 8 Ball, then multiplied by 18 from Gros Michel for 1,602 total—bringing me to 2,642 chips, which falls short of my 7,500 target. Let me check if the pair of nines performs better.\n\nA pair of nines gives 28 chips before 8 Ball's bonus, reaching 78 chips. With Gros Michel adding 15 multiplier on top of the base 2, I get 78 × 17 = 1,326 chips. Still insufficient.\n\nI should explore building a flush instead. I have 3 hearts and 3 diamonds available, with 16 hearts and 8 diamonds remaining in the deck. If I discard the non-flush cards—9♠, 3♣, 4♦, 3♦, 2♦—and keep 9♥ and 7\n\n♥, I'll draw 5 new cards with a decent probability of completing a heart flush. Alternatively, I could pursue diamonds by discarding 9♠, 9♥, 7♥, 3♥, 3♣ instead, though hearts seem more promising given the higher count remaining.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,5,6,7,8]"}
