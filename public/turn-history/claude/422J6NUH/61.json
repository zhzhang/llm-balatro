{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $4\n- I have 4 jokers (max 5)\n- I have 1 consumable (The Empress)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Judgement (Tarot): Creates a random Joker card - $3\n2. Even Steven (Joker): Played cards with even rank give +4 Mult - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack: Choose 1 of up to 5 Playing cards - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Magic Trick: Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 4 (80 base chips, 10 base mult) - My main strategy\n- Straight Flush: Level 2 (140 base chips, 12 base mult) - Just upgraded\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\nLooking at the pattern, I'm on Round 7 which is the Small Blind. Next will be:\n- Big Blind (likely 7500 chips)\n- Boss Blind (likely 20000 chips or more with \"Extra large blind\")\n\n**Last played hand:** Flush - 9,920 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $4 left. My options are:\n1. Judgement for $3 - Creates a random joker (risky but I have room for 1 more joker)\n\n\n2. Even Steven for $4 - Gives +4 Mult for each even-ranked card played. With 3-4 even cards in a flush, that's +12 to +16 Mult total, which significantly boosts my scoring. This directly supports my flush-focused strategy.\n3. Save money for the next shop\n\nI cannot afford the Jumbo Standard Pack, Magic Trick voucher, or a reroll.\n\nJudgement is tempting since it generates a random joker and I have one slot available, but the unpredictability is concerning—I might get something that doesn't synergize with my flush approach. My current hand scores around 8,680 chips with my existing jokers (Crafty, 8 Ball, Droll, Gros Michel) plus card chips from the flush, which should comfortably beat the 7,500 Big Blind threshold.\n\nThe real challenge is the 20,000 Boss Blind. Even Steven would add +16 mult if I play a flush with four even cards, pushing my total mult to 51 and my score to roughly 12,648—still short, but a meaningful gain for just $4. I'm leaning toward Even Steven since it's a reliable multiplier boost that works directly with my flush strategy, whereas Judgement's randomness feels too risky when I need consistent scaling. Though I'm also wondering if The Empress could enhance specific cards to Mult Cards instead, giving me +8 mult one-time. But that's a consumable, whereas Even Steven provides permanent +4 mult per even card played—so across multiple hands with 3-4 even cards in a flush, I'm looking at +12 to +16 mult consistently. The permanent effect makes it the stronger long-term play.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
