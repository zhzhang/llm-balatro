{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 9\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $11 (up from $9 after selling Even Steven for $2)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (4 slots filled, 1 empty after selling Even Steven)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (1 slot filled with The Moon)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1/4 chance for played 8 to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult (with 1/6 destruction chance)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n\n**Hand Levels:**\nFlush is Level 5: Base Chips 95, Base Mult 12\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  - Banner: +30 Chips per remaining discard ($5)\n  - Red Card: +3 Mult per skipped booster pack ($5)\n- Boosters:\n  - Jumbo Buffoon Pack: Choose 1 of 4 Jokers ($6)\n  - Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards ($6)\n- Vouchers:\n  - Overstock: +1 card slot in shop ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**My plan from the previous reasoning:**\nI just sold Even Steven to make room for a new Joker from the Jumbo Buffoon Pack. I now have $11, which is enough to buy the pack for $6 and have $5 left over.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy strategy is heavily focused on Flush hands. \n\nAt Ante 4 I was consistently hitting 9,000-12,000 chips per Flush, and now that I'm at Ante 5 with my Flush upgraded to Level 5, I should see even stronger scores. The Jumbo Buffoon Pack is worth the $6 investment since I have an open Joker slot and my current lineup consists of weak Commons. Finding a stronger Joker that either synergizes with Flushes or provides solid general value would meaningfully improve my scoring. After purchasing the pack, I'll have $5 remaining, which gives me flexibility for a reroll or other shop options if needed.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
