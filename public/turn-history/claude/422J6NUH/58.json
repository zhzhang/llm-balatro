{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Blind: Small (5000 chips needed)\n- Money: $2\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 3\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n2. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n4. 7 of Hearts Lucky Card (+7 chips, 1 in 5 for +20 mult, 1 in 15 for $20)\n5. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n6. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n7. Ace of Diamonds Steel Card (+11 chips, x1.5 mult while in hand)\n8. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI now have 6 Hearts! This is excellent for forming a flush. I can play a 5-card Hearts flush.\n\nLet me calculate the score:\n\n**Base Flush (Level 4):**\n- Base chips: 80\n- Base mult: 10\n\n**Playing 5 Hearts (let's say positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - the Ace, 9, 7, 7 Lucky, 4):**\n- Ace of Hearts: +11 chips\n- 9 of Hearts: +9 chips\n- 7 of Hearts: +7 chips\n- 7 of Hearts (Lucky): +7 chips\n\n\n- 4 of Hearts: +4 chips\n- Total card chips: +38 chips\n\n**Total Chips:**\n- Base: 80\n- Crafty Joker: +80 (if Flush)\n- 8 Ball: +50\n- Card chips: +38\n- Total: 248 chips\n\n**Total Mult:**\n- Base: 10\n- Droll Joker: +10 (if Flush)\n- Gros Michel: +15\n- Total base mult: 35\n\nThe Lucky Card gives me a 1 in 5 shot at +20 mult and a 1 in 15 chance for $20. The Steel Card's x1.5 mult multiplier applies while it stays in my hand, so I need to consider whether keeping it helps or if I should discard it to make room for the flush.\n\nWithout the lucky proc, I'm looking at 248 chips × (35 × 1.5) = 248 × 52.5 = 13,020 chips, which easily clears the 5,000 threshold. I should play the Hearts flush now. My best selection would be the Ace, 9, and both 7s of Hearts along with the 4, keeping the 2 of Hearts in hand to preserve the Steel Card's multiplier effect.\n\nLet me trace through the scoring more carefully. The Steel Card multiplier applies while it stays in hand, so I need to verify my chip calculation accounts for the proper scoring sequence—each card's base value, then modifiers, then any joker effects that trigger during the scoring phase.\n\nFor the flush I'm playing, the five cards contribute their base chips: Ace (11), 9 (9), 7 (7), Lucky 7 (7), and 4 (4) for 38 total. The flush itself provides 80 chips, Crafty Joker adds 80, and 8 Ball contributes 50, bringing chips to 248. On the multiplier side, the base flush mult is 10, Droll Joker adds 10, and Gros Michel adds 15, for a total of 35x. I'm keeping the Steel Card Ace of Diamonds in hand to maintain its 1.5x multiplier bonus.\n\nApplying that multiplier gives me 52.5x total, which means my final score is 248 × 52.5 = 13,020 chips. That's well above what I need, so I'm playing this hand.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
