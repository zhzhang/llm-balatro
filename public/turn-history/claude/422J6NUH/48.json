{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $29\n- I just beat the Boss Blind of Ante 3 with a Flush scoring 4,940 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Earth (Planet) - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips - $3\n2. Gros Michel (Joker) - +15 Mult, 1 in 6 chance destroyed at end of round - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 playing cards - $4\n2. Mega Standard Pack - Choose 2 of up to 5 playing cards - $8\n\nVouchers:\n1. Magic Trick - Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI'm running a Flush build with Level 4 Flush (80 base chips, 10 base mult). My last 7 hands have all been Flushes except for 2 early game hands. This build is working extremely well.\n\nWhat should I prioritize?\n1. Gros Michel is a strong joker that adds +15 mult unconditionally. This would significantly boost my damage.\n2. Earth is not useful - I'm not playing Full House\n3. Magic Trick voucher could be useful to buy specific cards to help build flushes, but at $10 it's expensive\n4. Booster packs could help add more cards to the deck\n\nLet me calculate my current scoring with and without Gros Michel:\n\n\nWith my current Flush (5 cards, ~37 chip value), I'm scoring 247 chips × 20 mult = 4,940. Adding Gros Michel would push that to 247 × 35 mult = 8,645 chips—nearly doubling my output. That's a massive damage increase for just $5.\n\nLooking at Ante 4's scaling, I'll need 5,000-6,000 chips for the Small Blind and potentially 12,000-15,000 for the Boss. The extra multiplier from Gros Michel gives me much better positioning for those thresholds. The 1 in 6 destruction risk is manageable given the immediate power spike. I have $29 available, so I can grab it and still have $24 left for other purchases or rerolls if needed.\n\nMy deck's suit distribution is solid with 16 hearts already, so I don't need to prioritize a booster pack right now. Since I have two open joker slots and Gros Michel is a strong multiplicative scaling tool, buying it makes sense. I'll go with buy_card 2.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
