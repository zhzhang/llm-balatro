{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n6. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Goal:** Need 800 chips to beat Small Blind\n\n**My Joker:** Crafty Joker (+80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush)\n\n**Resources:**\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Hearts: Positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (King, King, 9, 7, 3) - FIVE HEARTS! I can make a Flush!\n- Pair of Kings: Positions 2 and 3\n- Pair of 7s: Position 1 (Spades) and Position 5 (Hearts)\n- Pair of 9s: Position 4 (Hearts) and Position 7 (Diamonds)\n\nI have 5 Hearts! This is perfect for my Flush strategy with the Crafty Joker.\n\n**Calculating Flush Score:**\nIf I play the 5 Hearts (positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):\n- Base chips from Flush (Level 2): 50\n- Crafty Joker bonus: +80\n- Total base chips: 130\n\nCards played:\n- King of Hearts: +10 chips\n\n\n- King of Hearts (Lucky): +10 chips (plus potential +20 mult trigger)\n- 9 of Hearts: +9 chips\n- 7 of Hearts: +7 chips\n- 3 of Hearts: +3 chips\n- Total from cards: 39 chips\n\nThis gives me 169 total chips with a 6x multiplier, yielding 1014 chips before any Lucky Card activation. If that Lucky Card hits its 1 in 5 chance for +20 mult, the score jumps significantly higher.\n\nEven without the Lucky trigger, 1014 chips comfortably exceeds the 800 chip threshold, making this a strong play. I'll go with positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to complete the Flush. The sequence activates the Crafty Joker for +80 chips, then each card contributes its individual value as they're scored from left to right.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
