{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in a Planet Pack selection phase (Jumbo Celestial Pack)\n- I have 5 planet cards to choose from\n- Current money: $3\n- My build is heavily Flush-focused with:\n  - Crafty Joker: +80 Chips for Flush\n  - Droll Joker: +10 Mult for Flush\n  - 8 Ball (Foil): +50 chips\n  - Flush is currently Level 3: 65 base chips, 8 base mult\n\n**Planet Card Options:**\n1. Jupiter (lvl.3) - Level up Flush +2 Mult and +15 chips\n2. Venus (lvl.1) - Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\n3. Neptune (lvl.1) - Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips\n4. Uranus (lvl.1) - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips\n5. Earth (lvl.1) - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nJupiter is the obvious choice here. It directly upgrades my Flush hand, which is my main strategy and has been working very well. If I take Jupiter:\n- Flush would go from Level 3 to Level 4\n- Base chips would increase from 65 to 80 (+15)\n- Base mult would increase from 8 to 10 (+2)\n\nThis would make my Flush hand even stronger for the upcoming Big Blind (3,000 chips) and Boss Blind (4,000 chips with \"Must play 5 cards\" requirement).\n\nLet me calculate what my Flush would score at Level 4:\n- Base chips: 80\n- Base mult: 10\n- Card chips (example with 5 hearts totaling ~37 chips): 37\n\n\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Total chips: 80 + 37 + 80 + 50 = 247 chips\n- Total mult: 10 + 10 (Droll) = 20 mult\n- Final score: 247 × 20 = 4,940 chips\n\nThis comfortably exceeds the Boss Blind's 4,000 chip requirement. The other options don't support my current strategy—Venus, Neptune, Uranus, and Earth all upgrade hands I'm not building around.\n\nI'm going with Jupiter at position 1 to enhance my Flush.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
