{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 10\n- Just completed Small Blind\n- Current Money: $11\n- In SHOP phase\n\n**Owned Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush (Common, sells for $2)\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush (Common, sells for $2)\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1/4 chance for 8 to create Tarot (Common, sells for $3)\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult (Common, sells for $2)\n5. Wee Joker: +8 Chips per scored 2, currently +16 Chips (Rare, sells for $4)\n\n**Owned Consumables:**\n- The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- The Sun: Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts ($3)\n- Devious Joker: +100 Chips if Straight ($4)\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Jumbo Buffoon Pack: $6\n- Overstock voucher: +1 card slot in shop ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy current strategy is heavily focused on Flushes, which has been working well (Level 5 Flush). I have:\n- Crafty Joker (+80 chips for Flush)\n- Droll Joker (+10 mult for Flush)\n- 8 Ball (+50 chips always)\n- Gros Michel (+15 mult always)\n- Wee Joker (+16 chips, scales with 2s)\n\nLooking ahead, I'm at Ante 5/8, so I still have 3 more Antes to go. \n\nSince chip requirements scale up significantly with each remaining Ante, I need to evaluate what actually strengthens my Flush build. The Sun could complement The Moon for hand flexibility, but it's not essential. Devious Joker doesn't fit my strategy since I'm not playing Straights. Standard Pack might provide useful cards, while Jumbo Buffoon Pack offers more options but costs more. Reroll ($5) - Look for better jokers or planets.\n\nThe Jumbo Buffoon Pack stands out as my best move. At $6, it leaves me with $5 and gives me a shot at finding a joker with multiplicative scaling rather than just additive bonuses—something that would push my flush build further. I'm going to buy it.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
