{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades - +7 chips\n2. 6 of Spades - +6 chips\n3. 2 of Spades - +2 chips\n4. Ace of Hearts - +11 chips\n5. Jack of Hearts - +10 chips\n6. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n7. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n8. 4 of Hearts - +4 chips\n\n**Goal:** Need 1200 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n- Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n- Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Resources:**\n- 4 hands remaining\n- 3 discards remaining\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nBy suit:\n- Spades: 7, 6, 2 (3 cards)\n- Hearts: Ace, Jack, 7, 7, 4 (5 cards)\n\nGreat! I now have 5 Hearts, which makes a FLUSH!\n\nLet me calculate what I can score with this flush:\n\nPlaying cards 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (all Hearts):\n- Ace of Hearts: +11 chips\n- Jack of Hearts: +10 chips\n- 7 of Hearts: +7 chips\n- 7 of Hearts: +7 chips\n- 4 of Hearts: +4 chips\nTotal from cards: 11 + 10 + 7 + 7 + 4 = 39 chips\n\nBase chips from Flush (Level 2): 50 chips\nCrafty Joker bonus: +80 chips\nTotal chips: 50 + 80 + 39 = 169 chips\n\nBase mult from Flush (Level 2): 6 mult\n\n\nDroll Joker bonus: +10 mult\nTotal mult: 6 + 10 = 16 mult\n\nFinal score: 169 × 16 = 2,704 chips\n\nThis easily exceeds the 1200 chip threshold, so I'll play all five Hearts now.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
