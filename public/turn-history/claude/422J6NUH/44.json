{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $3\n- Jokers: \n  1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n  2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n  3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n- Flush Level: 4 (80 base chips, 10 base mult)\n\n**Current Blind: Big Blind**\n- Chips Needed: 3,000\n- Reward: $4\n- Skip Tag: Skip Tag - Gives $5 per skipped blind (would give $15 if I skip now)\n\n**Upcoming Blind: Boss Blind**\n- Chips Needed: 4,000\n- Boss Effect: Must play 5 cards\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Flush Scoring Power:**\nWith my Level 4 Flush and jokers:\n- Base chips: 80\n- Base mult: 10\n- Playing 5 cards of same suit (let's estimate ~37 chips from the cards themselves)\n- Total chips before jokers: 80 + 37 = 117 chips\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips = 197 chips\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips = 247 chips\n- Total mult: 10 (base) + 10 (Droll) = 20 mult\n- Final score: 247 × 20 = 4,940 chips\n\nThis is well above both 3,000 (Big Blind) and 4,000 (Boss Blind).\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n1. **Play the Big Blind**: I can easily beat 3,000 chips with my Flush build. \n\nI'd pocket $4 and keep the momentum going into the Boss Blind.\n\n2. **Skip the Big Blind**: The Skip Tag would immediately grant me $15 (jumping to $18 total), but I'd forfeit the $4 reward and face the Boss Blind directly.\n\nPlaying nets me $12 total across both blinds, while skipping gets me to $18 right away—a significant cash advantage that could open up better shop options.\n\nHowever, skipping means burning hands and discards I might need for the Boss. My Flush build thrives on the 5-card requirement the Boss demands, and my track record shows consistent over-performance: I've beaten similar Boss thresholds with room to spare. The 4,000 chip requirement feels manageable given my deck's potential.\n\nThe real advantage of the Skip Tag is the $15—nearly quadrupling my current funds. That opens up meaningful shop upgrades and boosters before facing the Boss, creating a stronger position for subsequent rounds. Even accounting for the hands I'd lose, the economic boost outweighs playing through the Big Blind for just $4 more.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
