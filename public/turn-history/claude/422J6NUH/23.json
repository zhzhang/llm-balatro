{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $9\n- Current Jokers:\n  1. Crafty Joker - +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n  2. Droll Joker - +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**What's coming up:**\n- Next is the Boss Blind (Ante 2, Round 3)\n- Boss Blind requirement: 800 chips, Play only 1 hand\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Rough Gem (Uncommon Joker) - $7 - Played cards with Diamond suit earn $1 when scored\n2. Seance (Uncommon Joker) - $6 - If poker hand is a Straight Flush, create a random Spectral card\n3. Arcana Pack (Tarot cards) - $4\n4. Standard Pack (Playing cards) - $4\n5. Clearance Sale Voucher - $10 (makes everything 25% off)\n6. Reroll - $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need to beat the Boss Blind which only allows 1 hand and requires 800 chips. Let me calculate what I can do:\n\nWith my current setup (Crafty + Droll Jokers):\n- Flush base chips (Level 2): 50\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- Total base chips: 130\n\nIf I play 5 cards in a flush with average chip values of about 8-10 each:\n- 130 + (5 × 9) = 175 chips\n- Flush base mult (Level 2): 6\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult\n- Total mult: 16\n- Total: 175 × 16 = 2,800 chips\n\n\nThat's way more than 800 needed, so I should be fine for the Boss Blind.\n\nMy current hand is already strong enough to pass. Rough Gem would generate money but doesn't help with the immediate challenge, leaving me with only $2. Seance requires Straight Flushes which I'm not building toward, so it's not a good fit for my current strategy.\n\nArcana Pack or Standard Pack both cost $4 and leave me with $5 for a reroll. The Arcana Pack offers tarot enhancements while the Standard Pack adds more cards to improve flush consistency. A reroll alone costs $5 and would leave me with just $4, limiting my options. Since my flush strategy is already performing exceptionally well and I only get one hand against the Boss Blind, I need to focus on maximizing that single play rather than building for future rounds. building a stronger foundation for higher antes. The Arcana Pack offers the most value—planet cards can level up my Flush further, and tarot cards like Death or The Devil let me reshape my deck or enhance individual cards. I'll take it for $4, leaving $5 for later needs.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
