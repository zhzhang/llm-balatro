{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Chips Needed: 7,500\n- Money: $0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades - +10 chips\n2. 10 of Spades - +10 chips\n3. 6 of Spades - +6 chips\n4. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\n5. 7 of Hearts (Lucky Card) - +7 chips\n6. 3 of Hearts - +3 chips\n7. 3 of Clubs - +3 chips\n8. 4 of Diamonds - +4 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card when scored (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- I have 3 Spades (Queen, 10, 6)\n- I have 3 Hearts (9, 7, 3)\n- I have a pair of 3s (3 of Hearts, 3 of Clubs)\n- I have even-ranked cards: Queen (not even), 10 (even), 6 (even), 4 (even)\n\nLet me analyze what I can do:\n\n1. **Play a 3-card Spade Flush**: Queen, 10, 6 of Spades\n   - Base Flush (Level 4): 80 chips, 10 mult\n   - Card chips: 10 + 10 + 6 = 26 chips\n   - Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n   - 8 Ball: +50 chips\n   - Total chips: 80 + 26 + 80 + 50 = 236 chips\n   - Base mult: 10\n   - Droll Joker: +10 mult = 20\n   - Gros Michel: +15 mult = 35\n   - Even Steven: 10 and 6 are both even (+8 mult total) = 43 mult\n   - Final score: 236 × 43 = 10,148 chips\n\nThis comfortably surpasses the 7,500 target. Alternatively, I could discard and hunt for a stronger flush by drawing more spades or hearts, particularly even-ranked cards to maximize Even Steven's multiplier bonus. A 5-card spade flush with even ranks would generate roughly 240 chips with similar multiplier scaling.\n\nHowever, with only 3 spades currently in hand and just 10 spades remaining in a 46-card deck, the probability of hitting 2 more spades on a single discard is quite low. The safer approach is to lock in the current hand now—it delivers well over 10,000 chips and preserves my discards for upcoming rounds. I should also factor in the Boss Blind ahead, which demands 20,000 chips, though my earlier calculations suggested I could accumulate around 13,750 by that point.\n\nLet me think about whether I can improve this further. I have 4 discards available, so I could try building a stronger flush by removing the non-flush cards. Looking at my suits, hearts has 16 cards left in the deck compared to only 10 spades remaining, making hearts the more viable target for a larger flush.\n\nIf I discard all my spades and the off-suit cards to chase hearts, I'd be keeping just three hearts and hoping to draw two more. The probability works out to roughly 11.6%, which is quite low. Given that I already have a solid three-card spade flush worth decent points, pursuing this risky draw might not be the best move. I should probably stick with what I have rather than gamble on an unlikely outcome.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3]"}
