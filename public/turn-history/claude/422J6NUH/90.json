{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 10\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $6\n\n**Owned Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +108 Chips (always active)\n\n**Owned Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n2. The Sun: Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Devious Joker: +100 Chips if Straight ($4)\n- Standard Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards ($4)\n- Overstock voucher: +1 card slot in shop ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Strategy Assessment:**\n\nI have a strong flush-focused build:\n- Level 5 Flush (95 base chips, 12 base mult)\n- Multiple flush-supporting jokers\n- Two tarot cards for suit conversion (The Moon for Clubs, The Sun for Hearts)\n\nMy typical flush should score around 13,616 chips now with the new Blue Joker.\n\n**What should I do next?**\n\nOptions:\n1. Buy Devious Joker for $4 - Doesn't fit my flush strategy at all\n2. Buy Standard Pack for $4 - Could get enhanced cards or specific cards, but unclear value\n3. Buy Overstock for $10 - Too expensive, I only have $6\n4. Reroll shop for $5 - Costs $5, leaves me with $1, might find planet cards or better jokers\n5. Proceed to round_select - Move on to the next blind\n\n\n---\n\nWith 3 Antes remaining and chip requirements climbing steeply, I need to prioritize scaling my flush further. A reroll for $5 could surface Planet cards to level Flush even higher, or reveal better jokers that synergize with my current build. The Standard Pack is tempting but offers uncertain value compared to the potential upside of finding dedicated scaling tools. Moving forward without additional investment feels risky given the difficulty spike ahead. best move is to proceed to round_select and focus on winning the upcoming rounds. I can earn more money at the end of each round ($1 per remaining hand + interest) and shop again after the Big Blind. My build is strong enough for now, and I should conserve resources until I see what the next shop offers.","action":"\"round_select\""}
