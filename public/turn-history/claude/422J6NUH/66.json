{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Chips Needed: 7,500\n- Current Chips: 1,040\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Hearts - +10 chips\n2. 10 of Hearts - +10 chips\n3. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\n4. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n5. 7 of Hearts (Lucky Card) - +7 chips\n6. 3 of Hearts - +3 chips\n7. Jack of Clubs - +10 chips\n8. 7 of Clubs - +7 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card when scored (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\nI have 6 hearts! This is a perfect 5-card flush setup. Let me calculate the best 5-card flush I can play:\n\nAvailable hearts: Jack (10 chips), 10 (10 chips), 9 (9 chips), 7 (7 chips), 7 Lucky (7 chips), 3 (3 chips)\n\nFor maximum chips and mult, I should choose:\n- Jack of Hearts (+10 chips) - not even rank\n- 10 of Hearts (+10 chips) - even rank, triggers Even Steven\n- 9 of Hearts (+9 chips) - not even\n- 7 of Hearts (+7 chips) - not even\n- 7 of Hearts Lucky (+7 chips) - not even\n\n\n- Total card chips: 43\n\nWith Jack, 10, 9, 7, 7 as my flush, the base Level 4 flush gives 80 chips and 10 mult. Adding the card values (43 chips), Crafty Joker's bonus (80 chips), and 8 Ball's contribution (50 chips) brings my total to 253 chips before multipliers are applied.\n\nFor multipliers, Droll Joker adds 10 to reach 20, Gros Michel pushes it to 35, and Even Steven contributes 4 more since only the 10 qualifies as even-ranked, totaling 39 mult. The Lucky Card offers a potential +20 mult but isn't guaranteed. Without that proc, I'm looking at 253 × 39 = 9,867 chips, which exceeds my 7,500 target. However, I'm reconsidering my card selection—I need to check how many even-ranked hearts I actually have available to maximize Even Steven's bonus. Verifying the math: base flush gives 80 chips, the five cards (Jack, 10, 9, and two 7s) add 43, Crafty Joker contributes 80, and 8 Ball adds 50, totaling 253 chips. For multiplier, the flush starts at 10, Droll Joker doubles it to 20, Gros Michel pushes it to 35, and Even Steven's bonus on the even 10 brings it to 39. That's 253 × 39 = 9,867 chips, well above the 7,500 target.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
