{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Chips needed: 22,000\n- Current chips: 19,094\n- Chips still needed: 22,000 - 19,094 = 2,906\n- Remaining hands: 1 (THIS IS MY LAST HAND!)\n- Remaining discards: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\nAll 8 cards are unknown (flipped face down due to boss effect)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +36 Chips currently (2 chips per remaining card, 18 cards in deck)\n\n**Deck composition (18 cards remaining):**\n- Hearts: 9 cards (50%)\n- Spades: 4 cards (22.2%)\n- Diamonds: 3 cards (16.7%)\n- Clubs: 2 cards (11.1%)\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\n- High Card - 2,074 chips (most recent)\n- Pair - 4,810 chips\n- Flush - 12,210 chips\n- Flush - 20,406 chips\n\nI need exactly 2,906 more chips to win, and I only have ONE hand left. This is critical!\n\nLooking at my last few hands:\n- High Card: 2,074 chips - not enough\n- Pair: 4,810 chips - this would be enough!\n- Flush: 12,210 and 20,406 chips - way more than enough\n\nSince all my cards are face down, I don't know what I have. But I need to make the best strategic decision.\n\nLet me calculate the expected value for different hand types:\n\n\nIf I hit a Flush, the base payout is 95 chips with 12x multiplier. Adding card values (~35 chips) gives roughly 130 chips before jokers. The Crafty Joker contributes +80, the 8 Ball adds +50, and Blue Joker provides +36, while Droll and Gros Michel boost multiplier by 10x and 15x respectively. This compounds to a final score well above my 2,906 chip threshold.\n\nFor a Pair, the math looks tighter. Base is just 10 chips with 2x mult, plus ~20 from cards equals 30 chips. Even with 8 Ball (+50), Gros Michel (15x mult), and Blue Joker (+36), I'm getting around 1,972 chips—which falls short. But I remember my last pair actually scored 4,810 chips, so I need to reconsider what I'm missing in this calculation.\n\nHigh Card only managed 2,074 chips previously, so that's definitely not viable. With one hand remaining and Hearts comprising half the deck, drawing 8 cards from 18 gives me an expected 4 Hearts. A flush would easily exceed my 2,906 chip requirement, making it the strongest play despite the risk of not hitting it.\n\nSince I'm limited to 5 cards maximum, I should select 5 cards to maximize my chances of landing something valuable. Playing fewer cards would only reduce my odds of connecting with a strong hand. I'll go with positions 1-5, aiming for a flush but prepared for whatever combination emerges.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
