Unknown (flipped face down)\\n2. Unknown (flipped face down)\\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\\n4. Unknown (flipped face down)\\n5. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\\n6. Unknown (flipped face down)\\n7. Unknown (flipped face down)\\n8. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\\n\\nSo I have 5 unknown cards and 3 known cards (7 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds).\\n\\n**Jokers:**\\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\\n5. Blue Joker: +60 Chips currently (2 chips per remaining card, 30 cards in deck)\\n\\n**Deck composition:**\\n- Clubs: 3 cards\\n- Diamonds: 5 cards\\n- Hearts: 15 cards\\n- Spades: 7 cards\\nTotal: 30 cards\\n\\nThe boss effect means cards are drawn face down after each hand played. Since I can't see most of my cards, I need to make strategic decisions.\\n\\nMy last flush scored 12,210 chips, which was less than expected. I need 9,790 more chips with 3 hands remaining.\\n\\nLet me think about possible strategies:\\n\\n1. **Discard the unknown cards**: I have 1 discard left. I could discard some unknown cards to try to get better cards, but I won't be able to see what I draw.\\n\\n\\n2. **Play what I have**: I could play the known cards and some unknown cards, hoping to hit something good.\\n3. **Use my consumable**: I have Venus which levels up Three of a Kind. This doesn't seem immediately useful unless I happen to have three of a kind.\\n\\nWith 5 hidden cards and needing roughly 3,263 chips per hand on average, my approach hinges on what those unknown cards might be. Since Hearts dominate the remaining deck at 50%, there's a decent chance some of my face-down cards are Hearts, which could set up another Flush for my Crafty and Droll Jokers.\\n\\nThe other suits break down as Spades (23%), Diamonds (17%), and Clubs (10%), so I'm less likely to draw those. I already see 7 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, and 9 of Diamonds in my hand. If I'm aiming for a flush, I should discard cards that don't match my target suit to maximize my odds. But here's the catch\\u2014the boss mechanic draws cards face down after each hand, so I can't actually see what I'm working with for the remaining two hands.\\n\\nSince I need nearly 10,000 more chips and have limited visibility into my deck, I should focus on playing strategically with what I know. Discarding the unknown cards won't help since replacements will also be hidden. My best approach is to either commit to playing all five cards hoping for a flush among the unknowns, or play a partial hand using my visible cards and hope the unknowns complement them.\\n\\nGiven that the deck is 50% Hearts and I have the 7 of Hearts showing, discarding the Queen of Clubs and 9 of Diamonds to draw new cards gives me a chance at building a Hearts flush. If several of my hidden cards are Hearts, this could yield the high-scoring hand I need to close the gap.\\n\\nI realize I only have one discard remaining after this, so I need to be decisive. Playing five unknown cards is risky\\u2014the odds of them forming a flush are slim. My best approach is to discard the non-Heart cards I can see, keep the 7 of Hearts, and rely on the probability that my unseen cards contain enough Hearts to complete a strong hand.\\n\\nI'll discard the Queen of Clubs and 9 of Diamonds in positions 5 and 8.\\nCommand: discard 5 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 108]\\nAnte: 5/8, Round: 12\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Crafty Joker.

Unknown (flipped face down)\\n2. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\\n3. Unknown (flipped face down)\\n4. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\\n5. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips) - Lucky Card enhancement (1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20)\\n6. Unknown (flipped face down)\\n7. Unknown (flipped face down)\\n8. Unknown (flipped face down)\\n\\nI have 3 known cards (Queen of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts Lucky) and 5 unknown cards.\\n\\n**Jokers:**\\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\\n5. Blue Joker: +56 Chips currently (2 chips per remaining card, 28 cards in deck)\\n\\n**Deck composition (28 cards remaining):**\\n- Hearts: 13 cards (46.4%)\\n- Spades: 7 cards (25%)\\n- Diamonds: 5 cards (17.9%)\\n- Clubs: 3 cards (10.7%)\\n\\nSince I have 3 Hearts visible (Queen, 7, Lucky 7) and 5 unknown cards, there's a good chance some of the unknown cards are Hearts. With Hearts being 46.4% of the remaining deck, the probability that at least 2 of my 5 unknown cards are Hearts is quite high.\\n\\n\\nWith 3 hands remaining and needing 9,790 chips, I need roughly 3,263 per hand. My previous flush generated 12,210 chips, so if I can achieve a similar result, I should clear the goal. Since I can't discard anymore, I'm forced to play what I have. My best approach is to select 5 cards strategically to maximize the flush potential\\u2014I have 3 Hearts already visible, so I need just 2 more Hearts from my 5 unknown cards to complete a flush and trigger both the Crafty Joker and Droll Joker bonuses.\\n\\nA Hearts flush would give me a base of 95 chips with 12x multiplier. The Queen, both 7s, and two unknown Hearts would contribute roughly 35 chips combined. My Jokers would add significant value: Crafty provides 80 chips when a flush hits, 8 Ball adds 50, and Blue Joker contributes 56, totaling 186 chips from Jokers alone.\\n\\nThat puts me at 316 chips \\u00d7 37x multiplier (or potentially 57x if the Lucky 7 triggers), yielding between 11,692 and 18,012 chips\\u2014well above the 9,790 I need to win. The key is ensuring I actually complete the flush by playing my known Hearts and banking on the unknowns filling in.\\n\\nIf I play positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with the Queen of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, and Lucky 7 of Hearts in known slots, I need both remaining cards to be Hearts. Given that 13 of my 28 remaining deck cards are Hearts, the odds of drawing two Hearts consecutively are roughly 46% for the first card and 44% for the second, giving me about a 20% chance both come through.\\n\\nI could try different combinations, but since I can't see the unknowns, they're all equally likely to be Hearts anyway. The real question is whether including all three known Hearts is my best strategy, or if I should focus on maximizing my odds with a different selection.\\n\\nLooking at my hand, I have the Queen and both 7s as Hearts. If I play positions 2, 4, and 5 along with two random unknowns, I'm banking on drawing two more Hearts from the five face-down cards to complete the flush. That gives me roughly a 21.4% chance. The expected chip value if I hit the flush would be around 11,692 chips.\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 5 flush 11500\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 109]\\nAnte: 5/8, Round: 12\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Crafty Joker.

The average I need per hand is 2,490 chips.\\n\\nLooking at my last hand, I played a Pair which scored 4,810 chips. Before that, flushes scored 12,210 and 20,406.\\n\\nSince all cards are face down, I'm playing blind. I have no information about what I'm holding. The key is to:\\n1. Play enough cards to maximize my chances of hitting a good hand\\n2. Given that Hearts are 52% of the remaining deck, there's a good chance I have multiple Hearts\\n3. My flush jokers (Crafty and Droll) are powerful when I hit a flush\\n\\n\\n4. With 8 cards drawn from a deck where Hearts comprise over half, I'd expect roughly 4-5 Hearts in my hand. Playing 5 cards gives me a reasonable shot at a flush, especially since Hearts dominate the remaining deck at 52%.\\n\\nThe actual probability of drawing 5 Hearts in sequence is quite low\\u2014around 3.6%\\u2014but it's still my best option given the card distribution. Since I'm uncertain about my exact hand composition, playing 5 cards and banking on a Hearts flush seems like the optimal strategy.\\n\\nIf the flush hits, the payout would be substantial: starting with 95 chips and a 12x multiplier, adding roughly 35 chips from the cards themselves, plus bonuses from Crafty Joker (+80), 8 Ball (+50), and Blue Joker (+46) would push the total significantly higher. the full hand to maximize my odds of hitting a flush or pair. Playing all five cards gives me the best shot at landing either outcome, since a pair alone might not provide enough cushion above the 4,980 threshold.\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 5 flush 11000\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 5/8, Round: 12\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Crafty Joker.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Chips needed: 22,000\n- Current chips: 19,094\n- Chips still needed: 22,000 - 19,094 = 2,906\n- Remaining hands: 1 (THIS IS MY LAST HAND!)\n- Remaining discards: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\nAll 8 cards are unknown (flipped face down due to boss effect)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +36 Chips currently (2 chips per remaining card, 18 cards in deck)\n\n**Deck composition (18 cards remaining):**\n- Hearts: 9 cards (50%)\n- Spades: 4 cards (22.2%)\n- Diamonds: 3 cards (16.7%)\n- Clubs: 2 cards (11.1%)\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\n- High Card - 2,074 chips (most recent)\n- Pair - 4,810 chips\n- Flush - 12,210 chips\n- Flush - 20,406 chips\n\nI need exactly 2,906 more chips to win, and I only have ONE hand left. This is critical!\n\nLooking at my last few hands:\n- High Card: 2,074 chips - not enough\n- Pair: 4,810 chips - this would be enough!\n- Flush: 12,210 and 20,406 chips - way more than enough\n\nSince all my cards are face down, I don't know what I have. But I need to make the best strategic decision.\n\nLet me calculate the expected value for different hand types:\n\n\nIf I hit a Flush, the base payout is 95 chips with 12x multiplier. Adding card values (~35 chips) gives roughly 130 chips before jokers. The Crafty Joker contributes +80, the 8 Ball adds +50, and Blue Joker provides +36, while Droll and Gros Michel boost multiplier by 10x and 15x respectively. This compounds to a final score well above my 2,906 chip threshold.\n\nFor a Pair, the math looks tighter. Base is just 10 chips with 2x mult, plus ~20 from cards equals 30 chips. Even with 8 Ball (+50), Gros Michel (15x mult), and Blue Joker (+36), I'm getting around 1,972 chips—which falls short. But I remember my last pair actually scored 4,810 chips, so I need to reconsider what I'm missing in this calculation.\n\nHigh Card only managed 2,074 chips previously, so that's definitely not viable. With one hand remaining and Hearts comprising half the deck, drawing 8 cards from 18 gives me an expected 4 Hearts. A flush would easily exceed my 2,906 chip requirement, making it the strongest play despite the risk of not hitting it.\n\nSince I'm limited to 5 cards maximum, I should select 5 cards to maximize my chances of landing something valuable. Playing fewer cards would only reduce my odds of connecting with a strong hand. I'll go with positions 1-5, aiming for a flush but prepared for whatever combination emerges."
