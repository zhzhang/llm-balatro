{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $6\n- Just won the Big Blind with a flush scoring 9,867 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, creates Tarot cards from 8s\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card when scored\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Saturn Planet card: Levels up Straight (+3 Mult, +30 chips) - Cost: $3\n- Ride the Bus Joker: +1 Mult per consecutive hand without face cards - Cost: $6\n- Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - Cost: $4\n- Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards - Cost: $4\n- Magic Trick Voucher: Playing cards can be purchased - Cost: $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at Ante 4/8, so I have 4 more antes to beat to win the game. Looking at my hand levels, my Flush is at Level 4 (80 chips, 10 mult, played 8 times), which is my strongest hand type by far.\n\nNext up is the Boss Blind, which will require a significant amount of chips. Looking at my previous boss blind performances:\n- Ante 1 Boss: Three of a Kind - 189 chips\n- Ante 2 Boss: Flush - 3,348 chips  \n\n\n- Ante 3 Boss: Flush - 4,940 chips\n\nThe scaling pattern indicates I'll likely need around 20,000+ chips for the Ante 4 Boss Blind. With only $6 available, I need to be strategic about purchases. Saturn doesn't help since I'm not playing Straights. Ride the Bus conflicts with my Flush strategy since face cards are often part of those hands. The Standard or Celestial Packs could strengthen my deck, but I'm limited on funds.\n\nSince Flush has been my most reliable hand, investing in the Celestial Pack ($4) to find a Pluto card would directly boost my primary strategy by leveling up Flush. This would increase both base chips and multiplier, giving me better odds against the Boss Blind. I could also grab the Standard Pack and have $2 left, though that feels less impactful than focusing on what's already working. A reroll might surface something better, but with limited capital, I should probably commit to upgrading my strongest hand type rather than gambling on finding something new.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
