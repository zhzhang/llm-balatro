{"reasoning":"Looking at the failed action from my last response, I tried to use `buy_and_use_consumable` on position 2, which was Jupiter in the shop. However, the error says \"Card at position 2 is not a consumable\". Looking at the Shop Cards section:\n1. Banner (Joker)\n2. Red Card (Joker)\n\nSo position 2 in the shop is Red Card, which is a Joker, not a consumable. I was confused because Jupiter is in my owned consumables at position 2.\n\nLet me re-examine what I should do:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 5/8, in SHOP phase\n- Money: $9\n- My strategy is focused on Flush hands\n- I have Jupiter (consumable) that can level up Flush from Level 4 to Level 5 (+15 chips, +2 mult)\n\n**Options:**\n1. Use Jupiter to level up Flush (free, just need to use it from my consumables)\n2. Buy something from the shop\n3. Sell something to make room or get money\n4. Reroll the shop for $5\n\nSince I want to use Jupiter to boost my Flush hand, I should use the `use_consumable` command, not `buy_and_use_consumable`. Jupiter is at position 2 in my consumables.\n\nJupiter says \"Level up Flush +2 Mult and +15 chips\" - this doesn't require targeting any cards, it's just used directly on the hand type.\n\nSo the correct command should be:\n`use_consumable 2`\n\nThis will level up my Flush hand from Level 4 (80 chips, 10 mult) to Level 5 (95 chips, 12 mult), which aligns perfectly with my Flush-focused strategy.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
