{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- Boss Blind requiring 20,000 chips\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Money: $2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n2. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips, Lucky Card)\n4. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips, +4 Mult) - Mult Card\n6. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips, +4 Mult) - Mult Card\n7. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n8. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\nI now have 5 Hearts in hand: King, Jack, 9 (Mult), 8 (Mult), 7. This is perfect for a flush!\n\nLet me calculate what I'd get from playing these 5 Hearts:\n\n**Base flush (Level 4):** 80 chips, 10 mult\n\n**Chips calculation:**\n- Base: 80 chips\n- Crafty Joker (flush bonus): +80 chips\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Card chips: King (10) + Jack (10) + 9 (9) + 8 (8) + 7 (7) = 44 chips\n\n\n- Total chips: 80 + 80 + 50 + 44 = 254 chips\n\n**Mult calculation:**\n- Base: 10 mult\n- Droll Joker (flush bonus): +10 mult\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n- 9 of Hearts (Mult Card): +4 mult\n- 8 of Hearts (Mult Card): +4 mult\n- Even Steven: The 8 of Hearts is even-ranked, so +4 mult\n- Lucky King has a 1 in 5 chance for +20 mult (but I won't count on it)\n- Total mult: 10 + 10 + 15 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47 mult\n\nThis flush would give me 254 × 47 = 11,938 chips. That's still short of the 20,000 needed, but it's a solid foundation to build on with my remaining hands.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,7]"}
