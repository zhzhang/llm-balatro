{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- Boss Blind requiring 20,000 chips\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips, +4 Mult) - Mult Card enhancement\n2. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips, +4 Mult) - Mult Card enhancement  \n3. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n4. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n5. King of Hearts (+10 chips, Lucky Card)\n6. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI've used The Empress on the 9 and 8 of Hearts, converting them to Mult Cards. Now I need to build toward flushes to maximize my joker synergies.\n\nCurrent hand breakdown by suit:\n- Hearts: 3 cards (9, 8, King)\n- Spades: 2 cards (6, 4)\n- Clubs: 2 cards (7, 3)\n- Diamonds: 1 card (Jack)\n\nI have 3 Hearts which is the most of any suit. With 16 Hearts remaining in the 46-card deck, I have a good chance of drawing more Hearts if I discard non-Hearts.\n\n\nMy best path forward is discarding the non-Heart cards to chase a Hearts flush. If I complete it, the Crafty Joker and 8 Ball would combine with the base flush payout to generate around 250 chips—still far short of the 20,000 needed, but it's the strongest play available with my current joker setup.\n\nFor multiplier, I'm looking at a base of 10 that gets boosted by Droll Joker (+10), Gros Michel (+15), and the mult cards in my hand. Even Steven could trigger multiple times if I draw even-valued Hearts, and there's a small chance Lucky King hits for +20. Even conservatively, I should reach around 50 mult, which would push my total score into the 12,000+ range—still not enough to win, but substantially better than my current position.\n\nWith Lucky King proccing, I could hit 17,000+ on a single hand. Since I need 20,000 across four attempts, landing two strong flushes like this would get me there. The real bottleneck is that I only have three Hearts right now, so I need to maximize my draw by discarding all the non-Hearts: the Spades and Clubs taking up positions 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,6,7,8]"}
