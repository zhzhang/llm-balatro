{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 9\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $9\n- Max Jokers: 5 (all slots filled)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (1 slot filled with The Moon)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1/4 chance for played 8 to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult (with 1/6 destruction chance)\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n\n**Hand Levels:**\nFlush is now Level 5: Base Chips 95, Base Mult 12 (successfully leveled up from Jupiter)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  - Banner: +30 Chips per remaining discard ($5)\n  - Red Card: +3 Mult per skipped booster pack ($5)\n- Boosters:\n  - Jumbo Buffoon Pack: Choose 1 of 4 Jokers ($6)\n  - Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards ($6)\n- Vouchers:\n  - Overstock: +1 card slot in shop ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI've successfully used Jupiter to level up my Flush hand to Level 5 (95 chips, 12 mult). Now I need to decide what to do with my remaining $9.\n\nMy strategy is heavily focused on Flush hands. I have:\n- Crafty Joker: +80 Chips for Flush\n\n\n- Droll Joker: +10 Mult for Flush\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips (always active)\n- Gros Michel: +15 Mult (always active)\n- Even Steven: +4 Mult per even card scored\n\nLooking at the available purchases: Banner gives +30 chips per leftover discard, which is inconsistent since I won't always have discards remaining. Red Card scales with skipped boosters but starts weak. The Jumbo packs could add more synergies to my deck, though my Joker slots are full. Overstock is too expensive at $10 with only $9 available.\n\nMy current Jokers all support the Flush gameplan effectively—Droll and Crafty specifically boost Flush scoring, while 8 Ball and Gros Michel provide consistent passive value. Even Steven rewards playing cards with even ranks. I should either save money for future rounds or consider if any shop option meaningfully improves this foundation.\n\nThe Jumbo Buffoon Pack seems most promising since I could swap out Even Steven (the least synergistic with pure Flush scoring) for potentially stronger Joker. That leaves me with $3 after spending $6, which gives me flexibility going forward.\n\nLooking at my other options to sell—Crafty Joker provides +80 Chips for Flush hands, Droll Joker adds +10 Mult when playing Flush, and my foil 8 Ball is worth $3—I need to weigh whether the pack upgrade is worth losing one of these contributors. Since I'm already scoring 9,000-12,000 chips per Flush at Ante 5/8, I should verify if I actually need the upgrade before committing resources. The Moon consumable I still have can convert cards to Clubs when I'm struggling to form natural Flushes, which might be sufficient for my current run.\n\nI'm leaning toward purchasing the Jumbo Buffoon Pack despite the cost. Even Steven is my weakest link here—it doesn't synergize with my Flush-focused strategy—so selling it frees up space without sacrificing my core damage output. With three more Antes to clear before winning, a stronger Joker from the pack could be the difference between coasting through and hitting a wall. I'll proceed with selling Even Steven and buying the pack.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
