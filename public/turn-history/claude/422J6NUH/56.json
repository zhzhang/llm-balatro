{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $2\n- I have 4 jokers (max 5)\n- I have 1 consumable (The Empress)\n- Running a Flush build with Level 4 Flush (80 base chips, 10 base mult)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Blind Select Options:**\n\nCurrent Blind: Small - 5000 chips needed, $3 reward\n- Skip Tag: $5 per skipped blind (will give $20)\n\nUpcoming Big Blind: 7500 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Skip Tag: Foil Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n\nUpcoming Boss Blind: 20000 chips needed, $5 reward\n- Boss Description: Extra large blind\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me calculate my scoring potential:\n- Base Flush: 80 chips, 10 mult\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips (if Flush)\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult (if Flush)\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n\nSo I have:\n- Base chips from Flush: 80\n- Chips from jokers: +130 (Crafty + 8 Ball)\n\n\n- Card chips: ~50 (5 cards averaging 10 each)\nTotal chips: ~260\n\n- Base mult from Flush: 10\n- Mult from jokers: +25 (Droll + Gros Michel)\nTotal mult: 35\n\nEstimated score: 260 × 35 = 9,100 chips\n\nThis should be more than enough for the Small Blind (5000 chips needed).\n\n**Should I skip or play?**\n\nThe Skip Tag would net me $20 total, which is substantial given my current $2. However, I need to weigh whether the money is worth more than playing through and building my deck further. The Foil Tag on the Big Blind skip is also valuable—getting a free foil Joker could significantly strengthen my hand. I should consider if I can afford to skip both blinds or if I need to play at least one to stay on track.\n\nLooking at my actual performance versus estimates, I've been scoring lower than theoretical—my last Small Blind yielded 4,176 chips, Big Blind 2,704, and Boss 4,940. This gap suggests I should play conservatively and ensure I can reliably beat the Small Blind rather than risk the skip strategy.\n\nThe real advantage here is using The Empress to enhance high-value cards during the round—that's a permanent deck improvement I'd forfeit by skipping. Even though the $20 skip reward is substantial, strengthening my cards now sets me up better for both the Big Blind and Boss encounters. I'll play through and use The Empress strategically to maximize my deck's potential.","action":"\"play_round\""}
