{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK selection phase\n- I have $7\n- I'm on Ante 3/8, Round 4\n- My current jokers are focused on Flush strategy:\n  - Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush\n  - Droll Joker: +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush\n\n**Pack Choices:**\n1. **8 Ball (Foil edition)**: \n   - 1 in 4 chance for each played 8 to create a Tarot card when scored\n   - +50 chips\n   - Has foil edition\n   - Rarity: Common\n\n2. **Supernova**:\n   - Adds the number of times poker hand has been played this run to Mult\n   - Rarity: Common\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my hand levels, I've played:\n- Flush: 4 times\n- Three of a Kind: 1 time\n- Pair: 1 time\n- High Card: 0 times\n- Everything else: 0 times\n\n**Supernova** would give me:\n- If I play Flush: +4 Mult (since Flush has been played 4 times)\n- This would be added to my Droll Joker's +10 Mult\n- Total: +14 Mult from jokers when playing Flush\n\n**8 Ball (Foil)** would give me:\n- +50 chips baseline (good)\n- Foil edition provides +50 chips (so total +100 chips when this joker is active)\n- 1 in 4 chance for each played 8 to create a Tarot card\n- This is useful if I have 8s in my deck and need more consumables\n\nLet me think about which is better for my Flush strategy:\n\n\nMy Flush hand currently scores around 3,348 chips with my existing jokers providing 80 chips and 10 mult. Supernova would add 4 mult to that, scaling up as I play more Flushes. The 8 Ball offers a flat +100 chips boost plus the chance to generate Tarot cards from 8s. I need to weigh whether the multiplicative growth from Supernova outpaces the immediate chip gain from 8 Ball.\n\nRunning the numbers: 8 Ball gives me roughly 5,130 chips per Flush compared to Supernova's 4,070, making it the stronger immediate choice. But Supernova's scaling is worth considering—after 10 more Flushes it hits +10 mult, and the growth continues from there. The question is whether I'll have enough time to benefit from that exponential scaling before the run ends.\n\nGiven that I'm moving into Ante 3 with tighter chip requirements, the instant +100 chips from 8 Ball (boosted by foil) feels more practical. The Tarot generation ability adds flexibility too. I'll go with 8 Ball.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
