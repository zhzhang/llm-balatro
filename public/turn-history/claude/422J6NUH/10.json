{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 1 (just beat Ante 1)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $10\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Max Jokers: 5, Max Consumables: 2\n\n**Shop Available:**\nCards:\n1. The Fool (Tarot) - $3 - Creates last Tarot/Planet card used (Sun excluded). Secondary: Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts\n2. Greedy Joker - $5 - Played Diamond cards give +3 Mult when scored\n\nBoosters:\n1. Buffoon Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n2. Jumbo Celestial Pack - $6 - Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards to use immediately\n\nVouchers:\n1. Clearance Sale - $10 - All cards and packs 25% off\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Previous Hand Performance:**\n- Played Flush (402 chips)\n- Played Pair (90 chips)\n- Played Three of a Kind (189 chips)\n\nSo I've used Flush and Three of a Kind hands. These are the hand types I should consider leveling up.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $10 to spend. Let me consider my options:\n\n1. **Buy Clearance Sale voucher ($10)** - This would use all my money but give me 25% off all future purchases. However, I'd have no money left for this shop.\n\n2. **Buy Greedy Joker ($5)** - This gives +3 Mult per Diamond card scored. I had a Steel Ace of Diamonds which was useful. This could be good if I continue to get Diamonds. Leaves me with $5.\n\n3. **Buy Buffoon Pack ($4)** - Get to choose from 2 Joker cards. Leaves me with $6.\n   \nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack at $6 would let me pick from 5 Planet cards to immediately boost Flush or Three of a Kind, which I've already played. The Fool for $3 doesn't help yet since I haven't used Tarot or Planet cards. I could also reroll the shop for $5 to see different options. Combining Greedy Joker and Buffoon Pack would cost $9 total, leaving me with just $1.\n\nAs Ante 2 approaches with steeper chip requirements, I need to prioritize getting jokers into my deck—I currently have none, which is a major gap. Pairing the Jumbo Celestial Pack with Buffoon Pack uses all $10 and gives me both a leveled hand type and a joker to start scaling, which feels like the strongest move right now. oon Pack combo for exactly $10 is solid. Let me start with the Buffoon Pack to secure a joker.\n\nI'm going to buy the Buffoon Pack first to lock in a joker, then reassess whether the Celestial Pack upgrade is worth the remaining $5 or if I should pursue a different strategy.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
