{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $2\n- Next blind: Boss Blind (Ante 4)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n5. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even-ranked card\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Saturn Planet: Levels up Straight (+3 Mult, +30 chips) - Cost: $3 (can't afford)\n- Ride the Bus Joker: +1 Mult per consecutive hand without face cards - Cost: $6 (can't afford)\n- Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - Cost: $4 (can't afford)\n- Magic Trick Voucher: Playing cards can be purchased - Cost: $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll Cost: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. I only have $2 and can't afford anything in the shop\n2. I'm about to face the Boss Blind for Ante 4\n3. My Flush strategy has been very successful (Level 4, played 8 times)\n4. Looking at past boss blinds, I've been getting around 3,000-5,000 chips with Flush\n5. The Ante 4 Boss Blind will likely require significantly more chips than previous antes\n\n**What can I do?**\nSince I can't afford anything in the shop with just $2, my options are:\n\n\n1. Sell something to raise money\n2. Move to round select\n\nIf I sell 8 Ball (foil) for $3, I'd have $5 total, which would let me reroll the shop. Selling The Empress or a cheaper joker wouldn't generate enough to afford anything meaningful. The reroll could potentially offer better options for the upcoming boss blind.\n\nHowever, I need to weigh whether losing 8 Ball's consistent +50 chips is worth it. Looking at my joker composition, Crafty Joker and Droll Joker are locked in for my Flush strategy, while Gros Michel provides solid general multiplier. 8 Ball and Even Steven are the most expendable—8 Ball gives flat chips but isn't flush-specific, and Even Steven only triggers with even cards. Selling 8 Ball makes sense if the reroll offers something that strengthens my core strategy more than the chip boost would. I also have The Empress consumable that could enhance 2 cards to Mult Cards before facing the boss. Each Mult Card adds +4 mult when played, so using it on cards I'll definitely play in my Flush could give me +8 mult total—a meaningful boost. Running the numbers: with enhanced cards in a Flush hand, I'm looking at roughly 250 chips from the base hand and my jokers, then multiplying by around 35-40 mult after accounting for Droll, Gros Michel, and the Mult Cards themselves.\n\nThat calculation puts me around 10,000 chips, which might fall short against a boss blind. I'm weighing whether to proceed straight to the next round and deploy The Empress strategically there, or sell something to reroll the shop. Selling Even Steven for $2 would give me $4 total—just enough for a Standard Pack that could offer better cards or enhancements. But Even Steven's +4 mult on even-ranked cards is solid value when those cards appear in my hand. I'm leaning toward keeping my current setup and saving The Empress for when I really need it.","action":"\"round_select\""}
