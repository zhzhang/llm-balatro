{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (Big Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 16,500\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $6\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n2. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20)\n4. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**Owned Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n5. Blue Joker: +92 Chips (currently)\n\n**Owned Consumables:**\n1. The Moon: Converts up to 3 cards to Clubs\n2. The Sun: Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have three 7s of Hearts, which is a three of a kind. But my strategy is flush-focused. Let me see what I can do:\n\nOption 1: Play the three 7s of Hearts as a three of a kind\n- Base: 30 chips, 3 mult (Level 1)\n- Cards: 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 chips (only the three 7s count)\n\n\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Blue Joker: +92 chips\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n- Total: 30 + 21 + 50 + 92 = 193 chips × (3 + 15) = 193 × 18 = 3,474 chips\n- This falls short of the 16,500 target\n\nOption 2: Convert some cards to make a flush\n- I have 3 Hearts (the three 7s)\n- I have 3 Clubs (Jack, 10, 5)\n- I have 2 Diamonds (Queen, 4)\n\nThe Sun lets me convert up to 3 cards to Hearts. Converting the Jack, 10, and 5 of Clubs gives me 6 Hearts total, allowing me to play a 5-card flush. With the flush base of 95 chips and 12 mult, plus the card values around 38 chips, I'd gain Crafty Joker's +80 chips and Droll Joker's +10 mult as flush bonuses. Adding 8 Ball, Blue Joker, and Gros Michel on top would push the total significantly higher.\n\nThe calculation works out to roughly 355 chips multiplied by 37 (combining all multipliers), yielding about 13,135 chips—closer to the target but still short of 16,500. I could alternatively use The Moon to convert the three 7s of Hearts to Clubs instead, creating a similar flush scenario with comparable results. Either approach with a flush beats the three of a kind option, though I need to verify the exact card values and multiplier stacking to see if I can reach the goal. : ~26,492 chips, which exceeds the 16,500 target.\n\nI should verify whether I can form a flush using only the cards in hand. Currently I have 3 Hearts, 3 Clubs, and 2 Diamonds—not enough for a flush without assistance. The Sun or The Moon consumable would let me convert cards to a single suit. I'll use The Sun to shift the Clubs toward Hearts, converting the Jack, 10, and 5 of Clubs. This gives me seven Hearts total, including the Lucky Card.\n\nPlaying the three 7s along with the Jack and 10 of Hearts maximizes the chip payout for the flush.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2,4,5,6]"}
