{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase, which means I just bought a Celestial Pack and need to choose one planet card\n- Current Money: $4\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n\n**Planet Pack Choices:**\n1. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush (+4 Mult, +40 chips)\n2. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult, +20 chips)\n3. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult, +15 chips)\n\n**My Current Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 4 (80 base chips, 10 base mult) - MY MAIN STRATEGY\n- Straight Flush: Level 1 (100 base chips, 8 base mult)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (30 base chips, 3 base mult)\n- Pair: Level 1 (10 base chips, 2 base mult)\n\n**Problem:** None of these planet cards level up Flush! This is unfortunate since my entire build is focused on Flush. I was hoping to get a planet card to level up Flush to Level 5.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n1. **Neptune (Straight Flush)**: This could be valuable if I can build straight flushes. Straight Flush is a higher-value hand than regular Flush, and I have a flush-based deck already. If I can get the right cards (5 cards of the same suit in sequence), this would give me a very strong hand. However, straight flushes are much harder to make than regular flushes.\n\n2. **Venus (Three of a Kind)**: Not very useful for my flush strategy. Three of a kind is a weaker hand type and doesn't synergize with my flush-focused jokers (Crafty Joker and Droll Joker).\n\n3. **Mercury (Pair)**: Also not useful for my flush strategy. \n\nPair is even weaker than the other options. **Neptune remains the strongest choice** since it's the only one that could realistically complement my flush deck—straight flushes are rare but powerful, and my flush jokers would still trigger on them. Upgrading it to 104 chips and 12 mult gives me a backup win condition if I happen to draw the right cards in sequence. both specific card combinations and luck to materialize. Still, Neptune remains the strongest pick since it offers the highest ceiling, works as a fallback if I hit a straight flush, and the alternatives—Three of a Kind and Pair—don't align with my flush-focused strategy at all.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
