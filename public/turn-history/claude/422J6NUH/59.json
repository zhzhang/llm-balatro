{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $8\n- I have 4 jokers (max 5)\n- I have 1 consumable (The Empress)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips, 1 in 4 chance for 8s to create Tarot\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult\n\n**My Consumables:**\n1. The Empress: Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Judgement (Tarot): Creates a random Joker card - $3\n2. Even Steven (Joker): Played cards with even rank give +4 Mult - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack: Choose 1 of up to 5 Playing cards - $6\n2. Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Magic Trick: Playing cards can be purchased from shop - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 7500 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Boss Blind: 20000 chips needed, $5 reward (Extra large blind)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just beat the Small Blind with 9,920 chips, which is almost double what I needed (5,000). My flush build is working well.\n\nLooking ahead:\n- Big Blind needs 7,500 chips\n- Boss Blind needs 20,000 chips (and it's \"Extra large blind\" which means extra tough)\n\n\n- I need to significantly strengthen my scoring to handle the Boss Blind's 20,000 chip requirement\n\nEvaluating my options: Judgement is tempting since I have room for one more joker, but the randomness is risky. Even Steven could be valuable—it grants +4 Mult whenever I play even-ranked cards (10, 8, 6, 4, 2), and if my deck contains enough of these, it could substantially boost my multiplier during flush plays.\n\nJumbo Standard Pack costs $6 to add a card to my deck, which feels expensive for marginal consistency gains. Celestial Pack at $4 is more compelling—leveling up my Flush hand type would directly increase both base chips and multiplier, creating a guaranteed scaling boost. Since my entire strategy revolves around Flush, this is the most reliable path forward.\n\nI'm going with Celestial Pack to upgrade Flush to Level 5. After that purchase, I'll have limited funds remaining, so I need to assess what else I can afford to maximize my final scoring push. the Celestial Pack first since it directly strengthens my flush strategy. With $4 remaining, I could then grab Even Steven for another $4, which would give me +8 to +12 mult depending on how many even-ranked cards I play—a solid complement to the pack's guaranteed value. Both purchases would empty my wallet but maximize my scoring potential this round.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
