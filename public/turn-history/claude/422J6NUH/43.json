{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (just finished selecting Jupiter planet card from pack)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $3\n- Jokers: 3/5 slots (Crafty Joker, Droll Joker, 8 Ball foil)\n- Flush is now Level 4: 80 base chips, 10 base mult\n\n**Shop Available:**\n1. Throwback (Uncommon, $6) - X0.25 Mult per skipped blind (currently X1.5). I haven't skipped any blinds so this would be X1 mult, not useful.\n2. Ride the Bus (Common, $6) - +1 Mult per consecutive hand without face cards. Could be interesting but I only have $3.\n3. Arcana Pack ($4) - Too expensive with only $3\n4. Reroll Surplus voucher ($10) - Way too expensive\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 3,000 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 4,000 chips needed (Must play 5 cards)\n\n**My Current Scoring Power:**\nWith Level 4 Flush and my jokers:\n- Base chips: 80\n- Base mult: 10\n- If I play 5 hearts averaging ~37 chips total: 80 + 37 + 80 (Crafty) + 50 (8 Ball) = 247 chips\n- Mult: 10 + 10 (Droll) = 20 mult\n- Total: 247 × 20 = 4,940 chips\n\nThis is more than enough for both the Big Blind (3,000) and Boss Blind (4,000).\n\n**Options:**\n1. Reroll for $5 - but I only have $3, so I can't afford this\n\n\n2. Buy nothing and proceed to round select\n3. Wait to see if better options appear, but I can't afford anything here anyway\n\nSince I can't afford any of the items in the shop (cheapest is $4 for Arcana Pack), and my current build is strong enough to handle the upcoming blinds, the best move is to proceed to the round select.\n\nI should use the `round_select` command to move forward.","action":"\"round_select\""}
