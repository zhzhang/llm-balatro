{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $6\n- Current Joker: Crafty Joker (+80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\nShop Cards:\n1. Droll Joker - +10 Mult if played hand contains a Flush - $4\n2. Delayed Gratification - Earn $2 per discard if no discards are used by end of the round - $4\n\nShop Boosters:\n1. Jumbo Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards - $6\n2. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards - $4\n\nShop Vouchers:\n1. Clearance Sale - All cards and packs in shop are 25% off - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Last Hand Performance:**\nI just scored 4,394 chips on a Flush! That's significantly higher than needed (only 800 required). This is excellent.\n\n**Upcoming Challenges:**\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 800 chips needed, but only 1 hand allowed\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\n1. **Droll Joker ($4)**: This synergizes perfectly with my Flush strategy and Crafty Joker. +10 Mult on flushes would be very valuable. With my current setup, I'm getting good chips but could use more mult. This seems like a strong purchase.\n\n2. **Delayed Gratification ($4)**: This doesn't fit my strategy well since I need discards to fish for flushes.\n\n3. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)**: This would give me a planet card to level up a hand type. If I could level up Flush further, that would be excellent. However, it costs all my money.\n\n\n4. **Standard Pack ($4)**: Adding cards to my deck could help, but I need to be careful not to dilute my flush consistency.\n\n5. **Reroll ($5)**: Not feasible with my current budget.\n\n**Decision Making:**\n\nWith $6 available, I'm weighing whether to invest in multiplier synergy with the Droll Joker, commit everything to leveling up my best hand with the Jumbo Celestial Pack, or preserve flexibility. The Droll Joker gives me immediate value on my proven flush strategy while leaving $2 for future opportunities, whereas the Jumbo Pack exhausts my resources but could significantly boost my hand scaling.\n\nMy core strategy centers on flushes—Crafty Joker already provides +80 chips when they hit, and Droll Joker would add +10 mult to the same hand. Since my Flush is already Level 2 with solid base stats, the multiplicative effect of stacking these bonuses is compelling. But the Jumbo Pack's potential to level Flush further and unlock additional planets is also attractive since higher-level hands make subsequent blinds more manageable.\n\nI need to estimate whether the immediate mult boost from Droll Joker or the scaling potential from Jumbo Pack creates better value for my remaining run. Base mult: 8\n- Score: 1,472 chips\n\nDroll Joker creates a much larger swing in my score—jumping from 1,014 to 2,704 chips is a 167% gain, while leveling Flush only gets me to 1,472 chips for a 45% improvement. Plus, Droll stays with me for the rest of the run and compounds with every hand, whereas a planet card is a one-time boost to a single hand type.\n\nI'm going with Droll Joker. It synergizes perfectly with my Flush focus and leaves me $2 to work with later.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
