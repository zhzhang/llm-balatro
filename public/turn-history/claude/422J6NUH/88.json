{"reasoning":"I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK phase and need to select a joker from the pack. I just sold Wee Joker to make room for a new joker.\n\nCurrent jokers:\n1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if Flush\n2. Droll Joker: +10 Mult if Flush\n3. 8 Ball (foil): +50 chips always\n4. Gros Michel: +15 Mult always\n\nPack choices:\n1. Blue Joker: +2 Chips per card in deck (Currently +108 Chips)\n2. Delayed Gratification: $2 per discard if no discards used\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even rank card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\nMy strategy is Flush-focused (Level 5 Flush, played 11 times). I analyzed in my previous reasoning that Blue Joker was the best choice, providing a consistent +108 chips on every hand I play.\n\nLet me verify this choice:\n- Blue Joker: +108 chips always - very strong and consistent\n- Delayed Gratification: Economic joker, not helpful for scoring\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult for Three of a Kind - doesn't fit my Flush strategy\n- Even Steven: +4 mult per even card - conditional, typically +8-12 mult on a flush\n\nFor a typical Flush with my jokers:\n- Base: 95 chips, 12 mult\n- Crafty Joker: +80 chips\n- Droll Joker: +10 mult\n- 8 Ball: +50 chips\n- Gros Michel: +15 mult\n- Cards played (5 cards, average ~7 chips each): +35 chips\n\nCurrent total: 95 + 80 + 50 + 35 = 260 chips × (12 + 10 + 15) = 260 × 37 = 9,620 chips\n\n\nAdding Blue Joker pushes this to 368 chips × 37 = 13,616, while Even Steven with 3 even cards only reaches 260 × 49 = 12,740. Blue Joker's consistent boost outperforms the conditional multiplier, so I'll take position 1.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
