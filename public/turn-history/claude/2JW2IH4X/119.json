{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current Status\n- Ante 6/8, Round 15\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $27\n- Just bought Uranus (consumable) - needs to be used to level up Two Pair\n\n## My Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Heart (changes at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult (from other jokers' sell values)\n4. Even Steven - +4 mult per even card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n## Consumables\n1. Uranus - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips (currently at Level 6: 120 chips, 7 mult)\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Gluttonous Joker - +3 mult per Club played - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - 1 of 2 Spectral cards - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\nCurrent Reroll Cost: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nI just bought Uranus as a consumable card (Planet card). I need to use it to level up Two Pair. Since it's a Planet card that doesn't require targets, I should use it immediately.\n\nAfter using Uranus, Two Pair will go from Level 6 (120 chips, 7 mult) to Level 7 (140 chips, 8 mult).\n\nWith $27 remaining, I have several options after using Uranus:\n- Buy Gluttonous Joker for $5 (but need to sell a joker first)\n\n\n- Buy Spectral Pack for $4\n- Buy Reroll Surplus for $10\n- Reroll shop for $5\n- Move to round select\n\nMy Flush strategy with Ancient Joker is solid, and Two Pair serves as a good secondary hand. I'll activate Uranus first to boost Two Pair, then reassess what to purchase. Since Uranus doesn't require specific targets, I just need to specify its position.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
