{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (so I've completed Ante 1 and need to start Ante 2)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $3\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n  2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card scored\n  3. Joker (basic): +4 Mult\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Gift Card - $6 (I only have $3)\n  2. Venus - $3 (Level up Three of a Kind)\n- Boosters:\n  1. Jumbo Standard Pack - $6 (I only have $3)\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Overstock - $10 (I only have $3)\n- Reroll cost: $5 (I only have $3)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith only $3, my options are very limited:\n1. Buy Venus for $3 - This would level up Three of a Kind\n2. Move on to Round Select\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- Straight - 2,403 chips\n- Two Pair - 360 chips (played twice in Boss round, once in Big Blind)\n- Pair - 232 chips\n- Full House - 224 chips\n\nI've been playing mostly Two Pairs (3 times), with one Straight, one Pair, and one Full House. I haven't played Three of a Kind yet, so Venus wouldn't immediately benefit my current strategy.\n\nHowever, I'm entering Ante 2 which will have much higher chip requirements. The Small Blind in Ante 1 was around 300 chips, Big Blind around 450, and Boss around 600. In Ante 2, these will scale significantly - typically something like:\n\n\n- Small Blind: ~900 chips\n- Big Blind: ~1,400 chips  \n- Boss: ~2,000+ chips\n\nVenus would upgrade Three of a Kind to Level 2 with 50 chips and 5 mult, which could be valuable as difficulty increases. But since I haven't relied on that hand type yet, it's unclear if this investment makes sense compared to saving for better shop options in future rounds.\n\nWith only $3 remaining and no ability to reroll or purchase anything else, I'm weighing whether to spend it now or preserve resources. The real question is whether Three of a Kind becomes relevant enough to justify the expense, or if I'm better off banking the money to accumulate for more impactful upgrades later when I have more chips and better purchasing power.","action":"\"round_select\""}
