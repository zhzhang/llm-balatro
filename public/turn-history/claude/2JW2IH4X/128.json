{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante 6/8, Round 16\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $24\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n## My Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Club (with Smeared, Spades also count)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult from other jokers' sell values\n4. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n5. Lusty Joker - +3 mult per Heart\n\n## Critical Issues\n- Ancient Joker just switched to Clubs (from Hearts)\n- Boss Blind will debuff all Hearts\n- Lusty Joker will be useless against the Boss Blind\n- Need to pivot to Spades/Clubs strategy\n\n## Upcoming Challenges\n- Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed (Hearts debuffed)\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Misprint - +? (incomplete description, risky) - $4\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\n## Strategic Analysis\n\n**Hanging Chad** is very interesting. It retriggers the first played card 2 additional times. If I play an odd-ranked Club/Spade:\n- First trigger: +31 chips (Odd Todd) + X1.5 mult (Ancient Joker)\n\n\n- Second trigger: +31 chips + X1.5 mult\n- Third trigger: +31 chips + X1.5 mult\n\nThe multiplier stacks multiplicatively across retriggered plays: X1.5 * X1.5 * X1.5 = X3.375 on a single card. This could be powerful for scaling.\n\nLusty Joker becomes a liability against the Boss Blind since Hearts get debuffed. Selling it would free up a slot and give me $2, though I'd lose the Swashbuckler synergy from its sell value.\n\nHanging Chad's retrigger effect is genuinely strong with Ancient Joker now anchored to Clubs. At $4, it's worth considering over a reroll. An Arcana Pack could offer suit conversions, but the outcome is less certain than what Hanging Chad directly provides.\n\nThe key timing issue: Ancient Joker shifts suits at round's end, so after the Big Blind it'll randomize again. Lusty Joker might cycle back into relevance if Hearts comes up, though that's speculative. Buying Hanging Chad for $4 leaves me with $20—enough cushion to grab an Arcana Pack later if needed.\n\nI'm at capacity with five jokers, so I'd need to sell Lusty Joker first to make room. That nets me $2, then I can purchase Hanging Chad. The synergy with my current jokers and the chip scaling toward those thresholds makes this the most reliable path forward.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
