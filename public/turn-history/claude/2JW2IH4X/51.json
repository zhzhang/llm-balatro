{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: 6 of Spades\n2: 8 of Hearts\n3: 5 of Hearts\n4: 3 of Clubs\n5: 2 of Clubs\n6: Jack of Diamonds\n7: 10 of Diamonds\n8: 6 of Diamonds\n\n**Goal:** Need 3000 chips to beat Big Blind\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Allows Straights with gaps\n\n**Consumable:**\nThe Chariot - Can enhance 1 card to Steel Card (X1.5 mult while in hand)\n\n**Available Hands:**\n- Pair of 6s (6 of Spades, 6 of Diamonds)\n- No other obvious strong hands\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should use The Chariot strategically. Since it gives X1.5 mult when the card STAYS IN HAND (not when played), I should enhance a card that I won't be playing in my hands. \n\nLooking at my hand:\n- I have a pair of 6s\n- I have some odd cards: 5 of Hearts, 3 of Clubs\n- I have two club cards: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs\n\nSince The Chariot gives X1.5 mult when the card stays in hand, I should:\n1. First use The Chariot on a card I won't typically play\n2. Then play hands while keeping that enhanced card in hand\n\nLooking at my current hand, the 8 of Hearts seems like a good candidate for enhancement because:\n- It's an even card (won't trigger Odd Todd)\n\n\n- It's not a club (won't get Ancient Joker bonus when played)\n- It's unlikely to form strong hands with my current cards\n\nNow I need to figure out what hands I can actually play. The pair of 6s is obvious, but I should also check if I can build a straight using Shortcut. With cards like 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, and Jack, I could potentially make 6-8-10-J, though I need to verify if this works with the gap allowance.\n\nLooking at how Shortcut works—it allows straights with gaps of 1 rank between consecutive cards in the sequence. So 10-8-6-5-3 would work because each pair has exactly one missing rank (9 between 10-8, 7 between 8-6, and so on). With my hand, I have the cards to potentially form such a sequence, though I need to check if I have enough cards and the right ranks to make it work.\n\nI can't form a viable straight with what I'm holding. My best approach is to use The Chariot on a card I won't need—perhaps the 8 of Hearts or a higher card—then play the pair of 6s. For the pair, I'm looking at a base of 25 chips and 3x multiplier at Level 2, plus the card values themselves adding 12 chips total.\n\nChecking my Jokers: Odd Todd won't trigger since 6s are even, and Ancient Joker won't help because I don't have both 6s as clubs. The regular Joker gives me +4 mult, bringing it to 7x. If Steel Card is active, that multiplies to 10.5x, giving me roughly 388 chips—nowhere near the 3000 I need. I should focus on discarding strategically to build toward Two Pair or stronger hands instead.\n\nThe 8 of Hearts seems like the best target for The Chariot since it's even and unlikely to contribute to my key combinations. After enhancing it, I'll discard to search for better cards that can form more powerful hands.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1,2]"}
