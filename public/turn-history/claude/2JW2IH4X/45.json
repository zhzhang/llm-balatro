{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in a PLANET_PACK selection phase\n- I have 3 planet card choices:\n  1. Jupiter - Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips) - Currently Flush is Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n  2. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult and +20 chips) - Currently Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult)\n  3. Uranus - Level up Two Pair (+1 Mult and +20 chips) - Currently Level 2 (40 chips, 3 mult)\n\n**My Hand Usage:**\n- Two Pair: Level 2, played 5 times (most played)\n- Straight: Level 1, played 3 times\n- Pair: Level 1, played 2 times\n- Full House: Level 1, played 1 time\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd rank cards\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Allows Straights with gaps\n\n**Analysis:**\nTwo Pair is clearly my go-to hand, having been played 5 times already. Looking at my recent plays:\n- Two Pair - 1,820 chips\n- Two Pair - 1,666 chips\n- Straight - 3,686 chips (highest)\n- Straight - 2,314 chips\n- Pair - 812 chips\n\nThe Uranus planet would level up Two Pair from Level 2 to Level 3:\n- Currently: 40 chips, 3 mult\n- After Uranus: 60 chips, 4 mult\n\nThis is a significant upgrade to my most-used hand type. Let me calculate the impact:\n\n\nIf I play a Two Pair with the same cards as before (2 Aces including a Bonus one, and 2 7s including a Bonus one), the base chips increase from 40 to 60 while mult goes from 3 to 4. With card chips totaling 220 and multipliers at 8x (4 base + 4 from Joker), I'd score 2,240 chips instead of my previous Two Pair scores. This represents a meaningful boost to my most reliable hand.\n\nJupiter and Venus don't apply since I haven't been using Flushes or Three of a Kinds. Uranus is the obvious pick—it strengthens the hand type carrying me through runs, and that extra scoring power will matter as blind requirements climb. I'll select Uranus.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
