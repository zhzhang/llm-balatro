{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8 (need to beat 3 more antes to win)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $11\n- At max capacity for jokers (5/5)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored (suit changes at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult (adds sell value of all other jokers)\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit (NEW!)\n\n**Shop Items:**\n- Mega Arcana Pack - $8\n- Standard Pack - $4\n- Seed Money Voucher - $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. I successfully bought Smeared Joker, which now makes Spades and Clubs count as the same suit. This synergizes perfectly with Ancient Joker, which gives X1.5 Mult per Club card. Now Spades will also trigger this effect!\n\n2. With $11, I generate $2 interest (one at $5, one at $10).\n\n3. My joker setup is now complete and synergistic:\n   - Odd Todd gives chips for odd ranks\n   - Ancient Joker gives multiplicative scaling for Clubs/Spades (thanks to Smeared)\n   - Swashbuckler adds flat mult based on joker sell values\n   - Even Steven gives mult for even ranks\n   - Smeared Joker doubles the effectiveness of Ancient Joker\n\n4. Two Pair is my primary hand at Level 5 (100 base chips, 6 base mult).\n   \nNone of the remaining shop options are worth pursuing. The Mega Arcana Pack and Standard Pack would both reduce my interest generation, and the Seed Money Voucher is unaffordable. My joker synergies are locked in, so I should skip shopping and move forward.\n\nI'm entering the next round with $11 that'll generate $2 interest, giving me $13 to work with. My Two Pair is upgraded, my jokers synergize well together, and I'm ready to tackle Ante 5 with improved scoring potential.","action":"\"round_select\""}
