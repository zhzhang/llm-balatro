{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the current situation and choose between the two jokers in the Buffoon Pack.\n\nCurrent jokers:\n1. Odd Todd: Played cards with odd rank give +31 Chips when scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: Each played card with Spade suit gives X1.5 Mult when scored\n\nOptions:\n1. Business Card: Played face cards have a 1 in 2 chance to give $2 when scored\n2. Joker (basic): +4 Mult\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- I've been playing various hand types: Straights, Two Pairs, Pairs, Full House\n- My strongest hand was a Straight with 2,403 chips\n- I'm now in Ante 2/8, so chip requirements will be significantly higher\n\nLet me think about the strategic value of each option:\n\n**Business Card:**\n- Gives $2 with 50% chance when face cards are scored\n- This is primarily an economic joker\n- I currently have $3, and money is useful for buying future upgrades\n- However, I need to focus on scoring power to beat higher antes\n- Face cards (J, Q, K) appear in various hands, so this could trigger reasonably often\n- But it doesn't directly help me score more chips to pass blinds\n\n**Basic Joker:**\n- Simple +4 Mult boost\n- This is pure scoring power\n- Will apply to every hand I play\n- With my current setup, this would be additive mult before any multipliers from Ancient Joker\n- Guaranteed value every hand\n\nGiven that I'm entering Ante 2 where chip requirements scale significantly, I need consistent scoring power more than money generation. The basic Joker gives me:\n- Guaranteed +4 mult every single hand\n- Stacks with my other multiplier effects\n- Simple but reliable\n\nThe Business Card:\n- Only helps financially\n- 50% chance means unreliable\n\n\n- Won't directly increase my chip output when facing steeper thresholds\n\nConsistent multiplicative power matters more than economic gains at this stage. The basic Joker's +4 mult will compound with Ancient Joker's X1.5 per Spade, creating reliable scaling. I should select the basic Joker.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
