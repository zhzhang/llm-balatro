{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante 6/8, Round 16\n- In PLANET_PACK selection phase\n- Money: $24\n- Need to choose 1 of 3 planet cards\n\n## Planet Options:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card (+1 Mult, +10 chips)\n2. Saturn - Level up Straight (+3 Mult, +30 chips)\n3. Uranus - Level up Two Pair (+1 Mult, +20 chips)\n\n## Current Hand Levels:\n- High Card: Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult)\n- Straight: Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 7 (140 chips, 8 mult)\n- Flush: Level 3 (65 chips, 8 mult) - NOT OFFERED\n\n## My Strategy Analysis:\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- I've been playing mostly Flushes (6 times) and Two Pairs (14 times total)\n- Last hand was a Flush that scored 21,260 chips\n- Ancient Joker just switched to Clubs (from Hearts), so I need to pivot to Spades/Clubs\n\n## Upcoming Challenges:\n- Big Blind: 30,000 chips\n- Boss Blind: 40,000 chips (debuffs Hearts)\n\n## Option Analysis:\n\n**Pluto (High Card)**: This is almost never useful since I should be able to form better hands than High Card. Skip.\n\n**Saturn (Straight)**: \n- Current: Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult)\n- After: Level 2 (60 chips, 7 mult)\n- I've played 4 Straights historically, but not recently\n- Straights are harder to form consistently\n- Not my primary strategy\n\n**Uranus (Two Pair)**:\n\n\n- Current: Level 7 (140 chips, 8 mult)\n- After: Level 8 (160 chips, 9 mult)\n- My most reliable hand type with 14 plays total\n- Modest gains but solid backup when Flushes aren't available\n\n## Strategic Consideration:\nNone of these options directly strengthen my Flush strategy, which has been my most successful approach. Since Venus isn't available, Two Pair remains my best fallback option given its proven track record and consistency.\n\nSelecting **Uranus** makes sense here. Two Pair has consistently delivered throughout this run, and while the +20 chips and +1 mult aren't dramatic, they'll help me push toward those 30k-40k chip thresholds. It's more dependable to form than Straight, and incremental improvements compound when I need reliable scoring hands.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
