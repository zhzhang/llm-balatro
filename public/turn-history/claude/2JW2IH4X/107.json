{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 14\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $26\n- Just bought Seed Money voucher for $10 (was $36, now $26)\n\n**Inventory:**\n- 5/5 Jokers (full):\n  1. Odd Todd (+31 chips per odd card)\n  2. Ancient Joker (X1.5 mult per Spade, changes suit each round)\n  3. Swashbuckler (+11 mult from sell values)\n  4. Even Steven (+4 mult per even card)\n  5. Smeared Joker (Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs)\n- 0/2 Consumables\n- Vouchers: Seed Money (interest cap now $50)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Misprint - $4 (random mult)\n2. Cloud 9 - $7 ($1 per 9 in deck, currently $5)\n3. Standard Pack - $4\n4. Buffoon Pack - $4\n5. Reroll - $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking ahead:\n- Next is Boss Blind of Ante 5\n- After that, Ante 6 begins with much higher chip requirements\n- Boss blinds cannot be skipped and often have special effects\n\nMy current setup is working well:\n- Two Pair at Level 6 (120 chips, 7 mult) has been reliable\n- Flushes work well with Ancient Joker (now on Spades)\n- Good synergy between Odd Todd, Even Steven, and Smeared Joker\n\nWith $26 remaining:\n- Cloud 9 costs $7 - would give me $5 per round (I have several 9s)\n- Buffoon Pack costs $4 - might find a better joker, but I'm at max capacity\n\n\n- Misprint costs $4 - random mult, risky\n- Standard Pack costs $4 - could add useful cards\n- Reroll costs $5 - might find better options\n\nCloud 9 seems most practical since it generates steady income over the remaining antes—it'd pay for itself in just two rounds. The Buffoon Pack could yield a stronger joker, but I'd need to sacrifice one of my current pieces, which disrupts my synergies. I should focus on what strengthens my position without disrupting my existing engine.\n\nMy current setup handles the Big Blind well, and my Two Pair and Flush strategies should carry me through the Boss Blind. The real challenge comes later in Ante 6+, where I'll need significantly more power. Seed Money gives me better interest at $26 ($5 per round), so even if I spend $4-7 now, I'd still accumulate decent returns. But holding onto capital for critical upgrades down the line might be smarter than spending on marginal improvements now.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack is tempting at $4, but I'm already maxed on jokers and would need to sell something first. With three antes remaining including this boss round, letting my money compound through Seed Money's interest seems like the stronger play than chasing incremental upgrades. I'll skip the shop and head to the Boss Blind.","action":"\"round_select\""}
