{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Blind: Boss\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Boss Description: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\n- Reward: $5\n- Current Money: $0\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: Each played Club card gives X1.5 Mult when scored\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Pair: 232 chips\n- Two Pair: 292 chips\n- Full House: 224 chips\n- Two Pair: 120 chips\n\n**Boss Effect Analysis:**\nThe boss \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\" - This is a challenging effect because:\n- It will reduce my hand size after each play\n- I'll have fewer cards to work with as the round progresses\n- This makes it harder to form strong hands\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n1. I need 600 chips total\n2. With my current jokers, I've been able to score:\n   - Pairs: ~232 chips\n   - Two Pairs: ~292 chips\n   - Full House: ~224 chips\n\n3. If I assume I have 4 hands and 3 discards at the start (standard), and each play discards 2 random cards, I need to be strategic about when to play vs discard.\n\n4. My jokers synergize well:\n   - Odd Todd gives +31 chips per odd card scored\n   - Ancient Joker gives X1.5 mult per Club card scored\n\n5. I should look for hands that maximize both:\n   - Odd-ranked cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n   - Club suit cards\n\n**Decision:**\n\n\nI'm locked into playing this boss blind since I can't skip it. The random discard penalty is manageable given my consistent scoring with these jokers - I've been hitting 200+ chips regularly, so reaching 600 across multiple hands is realistic even with the card loss.","action":"\"play_round\""}
