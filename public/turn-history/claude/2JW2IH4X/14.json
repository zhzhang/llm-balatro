{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2\n- Just completed the Big Blind (beat it with 524 total chips vs 450 needed)\n- Current money: $8\n- Currently in the SHOP phase\n- Have 1 joker: Odd Todd (gives +31 chips for odd rank cards when scored)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\n1. **Jokers:**\n   - Blackboard: X3 Mult if all cards held in hand are Spades or Clubs - Cost: $6\n   - Ancient Joker: Each played card with Club suit gives X1.5 Mult when scored, suit changes at end of round - Cost: $8\n\n2. **Boosters:**\n   - Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - Cost: $4\n   - Jumbo Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of up to 5 Planet cards - Cost: $6\n\n3. **Voucher:**\n   - Grabber: Permanently gain +1 hand per round - Cost: $10\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $8 to spend. Let me evaluate my options:\n\n1. **Ancient Joker ($8)**: This is a rare joker that gives X1.5 Mult for each Club card played. This is a multiplicative mult boost which can be very powerful. However, it costs all my money ($8). The suit changes at the end of the round, so it won't always be Clubs. This is a strong scaling option.\n\n2. **Blackboard ($6)**: X3 Mult if all cards in hand are Spades or Clubs. This is a conditional multiplier that requires specific deck composition. With $2 left over, I could potentially reroll or save for next shop.\n\n3. **Celestial Pack ($4)**: Planet cards level up hand types. Given that I've been playing Pairs and Two Pairs mostly, leveling these up could be useful. Would have $4 left over.\n   \nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack offers more planet variety for $6, leaving me with $2. Alternatively, I could hold my money and wait for better opportunities or save toward the Grabber voucher.\n\nLooking at my scoring patterns—Pairs and Two Pairs have been my most consistent plays, with Odd Todd providing solid chip boosts. As the ante increases, I'll need stronger multiplicative effects to keep pace with the blind requirements.\n\nAncient Joker's exponential scaling with Club cards is compelling: five Clubs yields X7.59 Mult, while even three Clubs gives X3.375 Mult. The main challenge is adapting when suits rotate. Blackboard requires all cards in hand to be Spades or Clubs for its X3 Mult, making it harder to control since it depends on what I'm holding rather than what I actively play. Ancient Joker appears more reliable for consistent scaling across different hands.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
