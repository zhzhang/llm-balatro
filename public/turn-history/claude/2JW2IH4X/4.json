{"reasoning":"I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK phase and need to choose between two jokers:\n\n1. **Odd Todd** - Played cards with odd rank give +31 Chips when scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3). Rarity: Common\n2. **Fortune Teller** - +1 Mult per Tarot card used this run (Currently +0). Rarity: Common\n\nLet me analyze which is better:\n\n**Odd Todd Analysis:**\n- Gives +31 chips per odd-ranked card that scores\n- Odd ranks: A, 9, 7, 5, 3\n- This is a flat chip bonus, which is added before multiplication\n- In my previous hands, I played:\n  - Two Pair: 10, Jack, 10, Jack (no odd ranks)\n  - Full House: 5, 2, 5, 2, 2 (two 5s were odd)\n  \nIf I had Odd Todd for that Full House, the two 5s would each give +31 chips:\n- Base: 40 chips\n- Cards: 5 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 16 chips\n- Odd Todd bonus: 31 + 31 = 62 chips (for the two 5s)\n- Total chips: 40 + 16 + 62 = 118 chips\n- Mult: 4x\n- Final: 118 × 4 = 472 chips (vs 224 without Odd Todd)\n\nThat's more than double! Odd Todd seems very strong if I can consistently play odd-ranked cards.\n\n**Fortune Teller Analysis:**\n- Gives +1 Mult per Tarot card used this run\n- Currently at +0\n- This scales over time as I use Tarot cards\n- In the shop, I saw \"The Hierophant\" which is a Tarot card\n\n\n- Purchasing and using it would unlock +1 Mult permanently, but that requires additional spending and provides no benefit until I actually use Tarot cards. Since I'm only in Ante 1/8, Odd Todd's immediate chip boost is far more practical for clearing the Big and Boss blinds coming up.\n\nLooking at my deck, roughly 38% of cards are odd-ranked, meaning I'll typically see 2-3 odd cards per hand. That consistent bonus aligns perfectly with what I need right now. Once I grab Odd Todd, I'll have $5 left—enough to consider The Hierophant for card enhancement, though I might hold the cash for later opportunities.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
