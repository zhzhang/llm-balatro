{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Boss Blind requiring: 10,000 chips\n- Boss Description: Play only 1 hand type this round\n- Money: $10\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Heart card scored\n3. Swashbuckler - +10 Mult\n4. Blue Joker - +104 chips\n5. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored\n\nThe boss requires playing only 1 hand type. Based on my hand levels and joker setup, Two Pair at Level 4 is my best option with 80 base chips and 5 base mult.\n\nFrom the previous reasoning, I calculated:\n- Playing 4 even cards in Two Pair: ~14,229 chips\n- Playing 4 odd cards in Two Pair: ~11,070 chips\n\nBoth comfortably exceed the 10,000 threshold.\n\nI'm at the BLIND_SELECT phase, and my only option is to play the Boss Blind (can't skip boss blinds). The available command is `play_round`.\n\nI should proceed with playing the round since I have a solid setup that can beat the boss blind requirement.","action":"\"play_round\""}
