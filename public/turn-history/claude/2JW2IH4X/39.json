{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6 (in SHOP phase)\n- Money: $10\n- Just leveled up Flush to Level 2 (Base Chips 50, Base Mult 6)\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Heart card scored (currently Hearts this round)\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut: Allows Straights to be made with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Delayed Gratification: $4 - Earn $2 per discard if no discards used by end of round\n2. Shoot the Moon: $5 - Each Queen held in hand gives +13 Mult\n3. Standard Pack: $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 playing cards\n4. Telescope Voucher: $10 - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for your most played poker hand\n5. Reroll: $5\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI've been playing Straights primarily (3 times), which synergizes with:\n- Shortcut (makes straights easier with gaps)\n- Odd Todd (odd cards give +31 chips)\n- Ancient Joker (X1.5 Mult per Heart card - suit rotates each round)\n\nNow I have Flush leveled to Level 2. If I can play a Heart flush, Ancient Joker would give me 1.5^5 = 7.59x multiplier bonus, which is very powerful.\n\nLet me evaluate the shop options:\n\n1. **Delayed Gratification ($4)**: This would give me $2 per unused discard. With 4 discards, that's potentially $8 at end of round if I don't use any. \n\nDelayed Gratification conflicts with my playstyle since I need to discard frequently to cycle through cards for straights. Shoot the Moon offers up to +52 Mult if I hold multiple Queens, but that's unreliable since I can't guarantee drawing them. Standard Pack adds a card to my deck, though I'm uncertain which would be most valuable. Telescope Voucher costs my entire budget but would lock in Planet cards for my most-played hand, which could accelerate scaling significantly.\n\nGiven my consistent reliance on straights, spending all $10 on Telescope makes sense—it guarantees long-term value by ensuring I can always level them up in future shops.\n\nBut I'm second-guessing myself. Emptying my wallet leaves me vulnerable: no rerolls next round, no flexibility if something useful appears in the shop, and I'd miss out on the $2 interest per $5 I'd earn. Holding onto the money gives me options and passive income across the remaining antes.\n\nShoot the Moon is another option—$5 for +13 Mult per Queen held—but that's speculative since I'd need to draw and hold Queens without playing them. My current setup with Ancient Joker and Odd Todd is already performing well enough to clear the blind requirements comfortably.\n\nI'll keep my $10 and move forward, banking the interest while maintaining flexibility for better opportunities ahead.","action":"\"round_select\""}
