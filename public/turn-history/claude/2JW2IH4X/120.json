{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante 6/8, Round 15\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $27\n- Just used Uranus to level up Two Pair from Level 6 to Level 7 (now 140 chips, 8 mult)\n\n## My Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Heart (changes suit at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult from other jokers' sell values\n4. Even Steven - +4 mult per even card\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Gluttonous Joker - +3 mult per Club played - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - 1 of 2 Spectral cards - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\nCurrent Reroll Cost: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nMy primary strategy is Flush hands with Ancient Joker providing multiplicative scaling. I've just upgraded both Flush (Level 3: 65 chips, 8 mult) and Two Pair (Level 7: 140 chips, 8 mult).\n\nWith $27 remaining, my options are:\n\n1. **Buy Gluttonous Joker ($5)** - Requires selling a joker first since I'm at capacity. Gives +3 mult per Club. With Smeared Joker, Clubs=Spades, but this doesn't synergize well with Ancient Joker which is currently focusing on Hearts.\n\n2. **Buy Spectral Pack ($4)** - Could provide powerful one-time effects, but spectral cards are unpredictable and can sometimes have negative effects or effects that don't align with my strategy.\n\n\n3. **Buy Reroll Surplus ($10)** - Reduces future reroll costs from $5 to $3, which could save money long-term but is a significant upfront investment.\n\n4. **Reroll Shop ($5)** - Spend $5 to see what else appears. With $22 remaining, I might find better jokers or more synergistic items that fit my current strategy.\n\n5. **Proceed to Next Round ($27)** - Move forward without spending. I'd earn $5 interest (at $1 per $5), starting the next shop with $32.\n\nBased on my recent hand history averaging around 11,000 points, I need to evaluate which option best supports my scaling strategy going forward.\n\nThe current shop offerings don't align well with my Heart/Diamond focus—Gluttonous Joker is off-theme, Spectral Pack is too risky, and Reroll Surplus costs too much upfront. Since I'm approaching Ante 6 where blinds will jump to 20,000-30,000 chips, I need to find jokers that synergize better with my Ancient Joker and Smeared Joker engine. Multiple rerolls seem worth exploring to locate better synergies rather than settling for mediocre options.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
