{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 5 (in BLIND_SELECT phase)\n- Money: $5\n- Boss Blind requiring 1,600 chips\n- Boss Description: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card scored\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut: Allows Straights to be made with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Last straight: 2,314 chips (well above the 1,600 needed)\n- Previous straight: 2,403 chips\n- I've been consistently scoring well above the threshold\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis is a Boss Blind, which cannot be skipped according to the rules. The boss debuffs all Diamond cards, which means:\n- Diamond cards won't contribute chips when scored\n- Diamond cards won't trigger any \"when scored\" effects\n- However, they WILL still participate in forming a hand type\n\nMy strategy has been focused on:\n1. Playing straights (which Shortcut now makes easier)\n2. Using odd cards (for Odd Todd's +31 chips)\n3. Using Spade cards (for Ancient Joker's X1.5 Mult per Spade)\n\nThe Diamond debuff doesn't directly hurt my strategy since I've been focusing on Spades. I should avoid playing Diamond cards if possible, but the debuff won't prevent me from forming straights or other hand types with non-Diamond cards.\n\nGiven that:\n- I scored 2,314 chips on my last straight (45% above the 1,600 threshold)\n- I have Shortcut now, making straights even easier to form\n\n\n- The debuff only affects Diamonds, leaving my Spade and odd card synergies intact\n\nI'm ready to face this blind. Playing the round now.","action":"\"play_round\""}
