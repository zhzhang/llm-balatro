{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Status:\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n  2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card (suit changed to Spades at end of last round)\n\n## Shop Options:\nCards:\n1. Gift Card - Add $1 sell value to every Joker/Consumable at end of round - $6\n2. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult, +20 chips) - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Buffoon Pack (2 Joker choices) - $4\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack (5 Playing card choices) - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Overstock (+1 shop card slot) - $10\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n## Analysis:\n\nI'm in Ante 2 now, which means the chip requirements will be significantly higher. I need to consider:\n\n1. **Gift Card ($6)**: This would add $1 to sell value of jokers/consumables. I have $7, so I could afford it. This is more of a long-term value play. With 2 jokers currently worth $2 and $4 respectively, they'd become $3 and $5. This isn't a huge immediate impact.\n\n2. **Venus ($3)**: Levels up Three of a Kind. I haven't played Three of a Kind yet, so this doesn't synergize with my current strategy. I've been playing Two Pairs, Pairs, Full House, and Straight.\n\n3. **Buffoon Pack ($4)**: Could get a new joker. This is potentially very valuable as jokers can significantly boost scoring. I have 5 max jokers and only 2 currently, so I have room for 3 more.\n\n\n4. **Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)**: Adding cards to my deck is less impactful than securing another joker right now. The Buffoon Pack seems more valuable for scaling my scoring potential.\n\n5. **Overstock ($10)**: Beyond my budget.\n\n6. **Reroll ($5)**: An option if I want to hunt for better offerings.\n\nWith $7 available, I could grab the Buffoon Pack for $4 and still have $3 left, or spend $6 on Gift Card leaving $1. The Buffoon Pack feels like the stronger play since I have room for more jokers and they're my primary scaling engine.\n\nMy previous round was strong—the Ancient Joker multiplied my Club cards into 2,403 chips, and Odd Todd continues to pull weight. Adding a third joker through the Buffoon Pack would give me two choices and likely unlock better synergies for Ante 2's higher thresholds. While I could conserve cash and move forward, the compounding effect of another joker outweighs saving $4. I'm going with the Buffoon Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
