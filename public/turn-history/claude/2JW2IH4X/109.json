{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n4. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n5. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n6. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Boss Blind:** Need 44,000 chips total\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 mult per Spade (with Smeared Joker, also Clubs!)\n3. Swashbuckler: +11 mult\n4. Even Steven: +4 mult per even card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker: Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n**Available Plays:**\n- I have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining\n- Need to score 44,000 chips total\n\nLet me identify possible hands:\n\n**Flush Options:**\nWith Smeared Joker, Spades and Clubs count as the same suit:\n- King of Spades, 10 of Spades, 9 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs = 5-card Spades/Clubs flush\n\n**Two Pair Options:**\n- 9 of Spades + 9 of Clubs (pair of 9s)\n- 3 of Hearts + 3 of Clubs (pair of 3s)\n- This makes Two Pair: 9-9-3-3\n\n\n- 9♣: +9 chips, odd rank → +31 chips from Odd Todd\n- 3♣: +3 chips, odd rank → +31 chips from Odd Todd\n\nAll five cards trigger Ancient Joker's multiplier since they're Spades or Clubs (treated as same suit via Smeared Joker), giving X1.5 mult per card for a total of X7.5 mult. The even cards (King and 10) each add +4 mult from Even Steven, while the odd cards (both 9s and 3) each contribute +31 chips from Odd Todd. Swashbuckler adds a flat +11 mult on top of everything. .59375 = 189.84\n\nTotal score: 184 × 189.84 ≈ 34,930 chips\n\nAlternatively, I could play Two Pair with 9s and 3s. Using King♠ as the kicker maximizes the Spade/Club synergy. This hand starts with 120 chips and 7x multiplier from the Two Pair hand level. The paired cards contribute chips through Odd Todd's bonus on the 9s and 3s, while the King adds value through the Ancient Joker's multiplier scaling. need to finish the calculation. With all five cards scoring in Two Pair, that's 9 + 9 + 3 + 3 + 10 base chips, plus 31 chips each for the four odd cards, totaling 278 chips. For multiplier, the King gives Even Steven's +4 to the base 7, Swashbuckler doubles that to 22, and Ancient Joker multiplies by 1.5 for each of the four Spades and Clubs, resulting in a final multiplier of about 111. This hand scores roughly 31,000 chips, but the Flush appears stronger at around 35,000.\n\nSince I'm aiming for 44,000 total, one Flush at that level leaves me needing about 9,000 more from my last three hands—definitely achievable. I'll go with the Flush.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,6,7]"}
