{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (Big Blind)\n- Chips needed: 450\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $2\n- Jokers: Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd-ranked cards: A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n- Consumables: The Hierophant (enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards for +30 chips each)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips) - even\n2. 6 of Spades (+6 chips) - even\n3. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips) - even\n4. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips) - even\n5. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips) - even\n6. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips) - ODD\n7. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips) - even\n8. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips) - even\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nOdd cards in hand: Ace of Clubs (position 6)\nEven cards: Everything else\n\nPossible hands:\n- Pair of 6s (positions 2, 5) - both even, both different suits\n- That's about it for strong hands\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should use The Hierophant to enhance 2 cards to Bonus Cards. The best targets would be:\n1. Odd-ranked cards to synergize with Odd Todd\n2. Cards that I can actually play in a hand\n\nCurrently, I only have 1 odd card (Ace). So I should:\n1. First discard to try to get more odd cards\n2. Then use The Hierophant on 2 odd cards\n3. Then play a strong hand\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I could also use The Hierophant now on the Ace and one other card that I plan to use. \n\nSince I only have one odd card, the synergy with Odd Todd isn't strong enough yet. I need to draw more odd-ranked cards first. My best approach is to discard weak cards that don't contribute to any meaningful hands—the 10 of Spades, Queen of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, and Jack of Clubs—then use The Hierophant on multiple odd cards once I've drawn them.\n\nI'll also keep the pair of 6s since they have value. After discarding those four cards plus the 4 of Clubs, I'm left with the 6 of Spades, 6 of Hearts, and Ace of Clubs. Drawing five new cards should give me better odds of hitting more odd ranks to work with.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,7,8]"}
