{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in a TAROT_PACK phase where I need to choose one of three tarot cards:\n\n1. The World - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Spades\n2. The Empress - Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n3. Judgement - Creates a random Joker card (Must have room)\n\nCurrent situation:\n- My jokers are at capacity (5/5), so Judgement is not viable without selling a joker first\n- My Ancient Joker currently gives X1.5 mult per Club suit card scored\n- With Smeared Joker, Spades count as Clubs, so Spades also get the X1.5 mult\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card 2 additional times\n- Odd Todd gives +31 chips per odd rank card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n\nLooking at my current hand:\n1. Queen of Spades (even rank, already Spades)\n2. Jack of Spades (odd rank, already Spades) \n3. Jack of Hearts (odd rank, Hearts)\n4. 10 of Hearts (even rank, Hearts)\n5. 6 of Hearts (even rank, Hearts)\n6. 2 of Hearts (even rank, Hearts)\n7. 8 of Clubs (even rank, Clubs)\n8. 10 of Diamonds (even rank, Diamonds)\n\nStrategic analysis:\n\n**Option 1: The World (Convert to Spades)**\n- Converting Hearts/Diamonds to Spades would make them count as Clubs (via Smeared Joker)\n- This would allow them to benefit from Ancient Joker's X1.5 mult\n- The Jack of Hearts is odd-ranked, so converting it to Spades would make it benefit from both Odd Todd (+31 chips) and Ancient Joker (X1.5 mult)\n\n\n- I could also convert the 10 and 6 of Hearts to build more Spades for potential flush synergies.\n\n**Option 2: The Empress (Mult Cards)**\n- Enhances 2 cards to Mult Cards which give +4 Mult when scored\n- This is a fixed +4 mult per card, which is much less powerful than the multiplicative X1.5 from Ancient Joker\n- Less synergy with my current setup\n\n**Option 3: Judgement (Random Joker)**\n- I'm at 5/5 joker capacity, so I can't use this without selling a joker first\n- Not immediately viable.\n\n**Best Choice: The World**\n\nConverting cards to Spades means they count as Clubs through Smeared Joker, which multiplies with Ancient Joker's X1.5. That's significantly stronger than the flat +4 mult. For targeting, the Jack of Hearts stands out—it's odd-ranked, so it synergizes with both Odd Todd and Ancient Joker. The 10 and 6 of Hearts would also benefit from the multiplicative boost. I should prioritize odd-ranked cards since they unlock additional multiplier effects.\n\nThe command is: select 1 3 4 5","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,5]"}
