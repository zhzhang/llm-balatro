{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8 (need to beat 3 more antes)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $18\n- Just sold Blue Joker, now have 4/5 jokers\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored\n3. Swashbuckler - +8 Mult (now +8 instead of +10 since I sold Blue Joker)\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored\n\n**Shop Items:**\n1. Smeared Joker - $7 (Hearts/Diamonds same, Spades/Clubs same)\n2. Mega Arcana Pack - $8\n3. Standard Pack - $4\n4. Seed Money Voucher - $10\n\n**My Plan:**\nI just sold Blue Joker for $2, going from $16 to $18. Now I need to buy Smeared Joker for $7, which will leave me with $11.\n\nThe Smeared Joker will make Spades and Clubs count as the same suit, so both will trigger Ancient Joker's X1.5 Mult effect. This is a strong synergy that should give me much better scaling than the flat +104 chips from Blue Joker.\n\nWith $11 remaining, I'll generate $2 interest ($5 threshold = $1, $10 threshold = $2).\n\n**Next Action:**\nI should buy the Smeared Joker at position 1 in the card section.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
