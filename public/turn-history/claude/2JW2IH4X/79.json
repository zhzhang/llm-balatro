{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- Just completed Big Blind\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $15\n- Next up: Boss Blind requiring 10,000 chips with constraint \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Heart suit card scored (changed from Clubs!)\n3. Shortcut - Straights with gaps\n4. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult\n5. Blue Joker - +104 chips\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Even Steven: +4 Mult per even rank (costs $4)\n- Madness: X0.5 Mult when blind selected, destroys random joker (costs $7)\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Celestial Pack: $4\n- Seed Money voucher: $10 (raises interest cap to $10)\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult) - most played (10 times)\n- Other hands relatively low level\n\n**Boss Blind Analysis:**\nThe boss requires playing only ONE hand type. This means I need to pick my strongest hand type and commit to it. Looking at my recent performance:\n- Two Pair has been my most reliable hand (Level 4, played 10 times)\n- Recent Two Pair scored 7,031 chips\n\nFor the Boss (10,000 chips needed):\nWith Two Pair:\n- Base: 80 chips + 5 mult\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips = 184 chips\n- If I score 4 odd cards in two pair: +124 chips from Odd Todd = 308 chips\n- Card values: ~20-40 more chips = ~330-350 chips\n\n\n- Base mult: 5 + 11 (Swashbuckler) = 16 mult\n- If I have 2 Hearts in the scored hand: 16 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 36 mult\n- Total: ~330 × 36 = ~11,880 chips\n\nThis should be enough! But I need to be careful about the Ancient Joker now triggering on Hearts instead of Clubs, and I need to ensure I can consistently make Two Pairs with Hearts in them. Even Steven could add more mult per even rank, but I should focus on securing the hand type constraint first.\n\nMadness is a trap—it halves my mult and destroys a random joker, which could wreck my setup. Standard Pack doesn't help since I have enough cards. Celestial Pack stands out though; leveling Two Pair directly increases its base chips and mult, making it much easier to cross the 10,000 threshold. Seed Money's interest boost is nice but not urgent. Reroll could help find better cards or jokers, though I'm already in a decent position.\n\nI'm going with Celestial Pack for $4. It's the most direct way to strengthen my hand against the Boss, leaving me with $11 afterward. I could reroll instead, but the guaranteed improvement from leveling Two Pair feels more reliable than hoping for something better in the shop.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
