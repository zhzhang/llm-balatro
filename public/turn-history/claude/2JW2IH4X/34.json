{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 5 (in SHOP phase)\n- Money: $5\n- Next up: Boss Blind requiring 1,600 chips (Boss debuffs all Diamond cards)\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card scored\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut: Allows Straights to be made with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- To Do List: $4 - Earn $4 if poker hand is Full House\n- Greedy Joker: $5 - Diamond cards give +3 Mult (but Boss debuffs Diamonds!)\n- Overstock Voucher: $10 - +1 card slot in shop\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $5 and need to make a decision. Let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **To Do List ($4)**: This gives me $4 back if I play a Full House. I've only played 1 Full House so far in the entire run. Full Houses are hard to form consistently. Even if I buy it and play a Full House next round, I'd just break even. This doesn't seem worth it.\n\n2. **Greedy Joker ($5)**: This would cost all my money and gives +3 Mult per Diamond card scored. However, the BOSS BLIND DEBUFFS ALL DIAMOND CARDS! This would be completely useless for the next round. Terrible choice.\n\n3. **Overstock Voucher ($10)**: I can't afford this with only $5.\n\n4. **Reroll Shop ($5)**: This would cost all my money and give me a new set of shop options. However, I'd have $0 left, so I couldn't buy anything from the rerolled shop anyway. This seems wasteful.\n   \n5. **Skip purchases and advance**: My current joker setup is performing well—I scored 2,314 chips on my last straight, comfortably above the 1,600 chip threshold for the Boss Blind. With Shortcut making straights easier to form and my existing multipliers, I should handle the next round without additional purchases. Holding onto my $5 also gives me interest income at round end and preserves options for future rounds.\n\nNone of the available purchases make sense for my current strategy. To Do List demands consistent Full Houses I'm not building, Greedy Joker actively hurts against the Boss Blind, Overstock is out of reach, and rerolling would leave me broke. The smart move is to proceed to round select, beat the Boss Blind, collect the interest, and enter the next shop with more capital for better upgrades.","action":"\"round_select\""}
