{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current Status\n- Ante 6/8, Round 15\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $30\n- Just upgraded Flush to Level 3 (65 chips, 8 mult)\n\n## My Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Heart (changes at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult (from other jokers' sell values)\n4. Even Steven - +4 mult per even card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Gluttonous Joker - +3 mult per Club played - $5\n2. Uranus - Level up Two Pair (+1 mult, +20 chips) - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - 1 of 2 Spectral cards - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\nCurrent Reroll Cost: $5\n\n## Analysis\n\nMy primary strategy has been Flush plays with Ancient Joker multiplicative scaling. I just upgraded Flush to Level 3 (65 chips, 8 mult), which should help significantly.\n\nWith $30, I have several options:\n\n1. **Buy Uranus ($3)** - This would level up Two Pair to Level 7 (140 chips, 8 mult). Two Pair has been my secondary hand and is already at Level 6. This is a cheap upgrade that maintains flexibility.\n\n2. **Buy Gluttonous Joker ($5)** - But I'm at capacity, so I'd need to sell a joker first. This gives +3 mult per Club. With Smeared Joker, Clubs count as Spades. This doesn't synergize as well with Ancient Joker (currently Heart-focused).\n   \nThe Spectral Pack offers unpredictable but potentially powerful effects, while Reroll Surplus would let me explore more options—I could reroll 6 times with the remaining $20 instead of just 4. Alternatively, I could spend $5 on a single reroll to see what else becomes available. Since Ante 6 will bring significantly tougher blinds, I need to decide whether to strengthen my current Flush-Ancient Joker engine or invest in flexibility through rerolls. Rerolling now would cost $5 and leave me with $25, but I'm not confident it would turn up anything better than what Uranus offers. Buying Uranus is the clear choice—it's an affordable upgrade to a hand I've relied on, and I'll still have solid capital for future shops.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
