{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (odd, Spades)\n2. Jack of Hearts (not odd/even, Hearts - counts as Diamonds with Smeared)\n3. King of Clubs (not odd/even, Clubs - counts as Spades with Smeared)\n4. 8 of Clubs (even, Clubs - counts as Spades with Smeared)\n5. 5 of Clubs (odd, Clubs - counts as Spades with Smeared)\n6. 10 of Diamonds (even, Diamonds)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (odd, Diamonds)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (even, Diamonds)\n\n**Objective:** Need 16,500 chips\n\n**Available Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - Each Diamond card gives X1.5 Mult when scored\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n\nLet me look for the best hand:\n\n**Option 1: Three Diamonds Flush (10♦, 9♦, 4♦)**\n- Base: 50 chips, 6 mult\n- Cards: 10 (even) + 9 (odd) + 4 (even) = 23 chips\n- Odd Todd: 9 = +31 chips\n- Even Steven: 10, 4 = +8 mult\n- Total chips: 50 + 23 + 31 = 104 chips\n\n\n- Total mult: 6 + 8 + 11 (Swashbuckler) = 25 mult\n- Ancient Joker: 3 diamonds = X3.375\n- Final score: 104 × 25 × 3.375 = 8,775 chips\n\nThis three-card Diamond flush with the Ancient Joker multiplier gives solid value, but I need to explore other combinations. I notice I have three Diamonds available and should check if pairing strategies or other hand types might yield better results.\n\nLooking at the full composition with Smeared Joker converting Hearts to Diamonds: I have 10♦, 9♦, 4♦, and J♥ forming a four-card \"Diamond\" flush, while the remaining cards (7♠, K♣, 8♣, 5♣) create a four-card \"Spade\" group. A four-card Diamond flush would give me 50 chips and 6 mult as the base, though I need to evaluate whether this beats my current best option. diamonds (10♦, 9♦, 4♦, J♥). I need to explore other options since I'm still falling short of the target.\n\nWith 4 hands and 4 discards remaining, I should strategically discard cards that don't contribute to my diamond strategy. The 7♠, K♣, 8♣, and 5♣ are all dead weight here. I'll keep my four diamond-counting cards and discard these four to hunt for another diamond or heart that could push me to a five-card flush.\n\nBut wait—I'm realizing a four-card flush doesn't actually count as a valid hand. A flush requires exactly five cards, so my current approach won't work unless I can draw a fifth card. This means I need to either commit to playing five cards and hope they form a legitimate hand type, or reconsider my entire strategy and look at what other five-card combinations are actually possible.\n\nLooking at potential five-card hands, adding any remaining card (7♠, K♣, 8♣, 5♣) to my diamonds won't create a flush since I'd still be short on matching suits. Even accounting for Smeared Joker making the Jack of Hearts count as a Diamond, I don't have another Heart or Diamond to complete the fifth card needed. My best move is to discard and draw fresh cards.\n\nI'll let go of 7♠, K♣, 8♣, and 5♣ to keep 10♦, 9♦, 4♦, and J♥, then draw four new cards hoping to hit another Diamond or Heart. Before committing to this though, I should verify there's no other viable hand—no pairs, no straights work with what I'm holding, so chasing the flush is my strongest path forward.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,5]"}
