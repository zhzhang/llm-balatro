{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Position:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 0\n- At the BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Need to decide: play or skip the Small Blind\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- Money: $4\n- No jokers yet (max 5)\n- No consumables yet (max 2)\n- No tags, no vouchers\n\n**Small Blind Option:**\n- Chips needed: 300\n- Reward: $3\n- Tag for skipping: Skip Tag (gives $5 per skipped blind this run, would give $5 now)\n\n**Upcoming Big Blind:**\n- Chips needed: 450\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Economy Tag (doubles money, max $40)\n\n**Upcoming Boss Blind:**\n- Chips needed: 600\n- Boss effect: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\n- Reward: $5\n- Cannot be skipped\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nIf I skip the Small Blind:\n- I get the Skip Tag worth $5\n- Total money: $4 + $5 = $9\n- I don't get the $3 reward\n- I stay in BLIND_SELECT phase for the Big Blind\n\nIf I play the Small Blind:\n- I need to score 300 chips\n- With starting deck and no jokers, this should be easily achievable\n- I get $3 reward\n- Then I go to shop phase with $7 total\n- Then I face the Big Blind\n\nLet me think about the Skip Tag strategy:\n- Skip Tag gives $5 now\n- If I skip this, I'll have $9\n- Then I need to decide on the Big Blind (which has Economy Tag)\n- If I skip the Big Blind too, I'd get the Economy Tag which doubles money (capped at $40)\n- With $9, doubling gives $18\n- But then I'd have to face the Boss Blind without any shopping opportunities\n\n\n- If I skip both blinds, I'd have $18 but no jokers or enhancements to handle the boss's discard effect. Playing both blinds instead gives me two shop phases to build up my deck, leaving me with $7-11 but much better equipped. The question becomes whether raw cash or deck quality matters more for the boss fight.\n\nThe boss blind discards 2 random cards each hand, so I'll need solid jokers and enhancements to survive it. A basic deck can easily hit 300 chips for the small blind—a pair gets me to 60, two pair around 100, three of a kind to 150+, and a straight past 200. This means playing small blind is very feasible and opens up the shop phase.\n\nWith four hands available, I can comfortably reach 300 chips even with modest hands. The $3 reward brings me to $7 total, and more importantly, I get two shopping opportunities before facing the boss. That access to buy jokers and items is critical for handling the difficult debuff. Skipping for the $5 from tag isn't worth losing those two shop phases.","action":"\"play_round\""}
