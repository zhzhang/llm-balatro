{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current Status:\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $3\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n  2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card scored\n  3. Joker (basic): +4 Mult\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 3, so room for 2 more)\n\n## Blind Options:\n\n**Current Blind: Small**\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Reward: $3\n- Tag for skipping: Top-up Tag (Create up to 2 Common Jokers - Must have room)\n\n**Upcoming Blind: Big**\n- Chips Needed: 1200\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Uncommon Tag (Shop has a free Uncommon Joker)\n\n**Upcoming Boss Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Boss Description: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\n## Analysis:\n\n### Should I skip the Small Blind?\n\nThe Top-up Tag would give me up to 2 Common Jokers. I have room for 2 more jokers (3/5 currently).\n\nPros of skipping:\n- Get 2 Common Jokers for free (could be worth $6-10 in the shop)\n- Common jokers could provide useful synergies\n\nCons of skipping:\n- Lose $3 reward for beating the blind\n- Don't get to accumulate money before harder blinds\n- Miss out on interest and hand money\n\n### Can I beat the Small Blind?\n\nLet me estimate my scoring potential with 800 chips needed:\n\nMy last played hands:\n\n\n- Straight - 2,403 chips (in Ante 1 Boss)\n- Two Pair - 360 chips (in Ante 1 Big)\n- Two Pair - 292 chips (in Ante 1 Big)\n\nWith my current jokers, a Two Pair could score around 20 base chips × 2 mult, then Odd Todd adds +31 per odd card, and Ancient Joker multiplies by 1.5 for each Spade. If I can construct a hand with multiple odd-ranked Spades, I should comfortably exceed 800 chips.\n\nThe Top-up Tag offering 2 Common Jokers is tempting, but I need to prioritize cash flow to shop effectively and survive the round. Since I can beat the Small Blind without difficulty, I should focus on maintaining resources.","action":"\"play_round\""}
