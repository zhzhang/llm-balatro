{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 7 (SHOP phase)\n- Money: $6\n- I have The Chariot consumable that can enhance a card to Steel Card (X1.5 mult when it stays in hand)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Allows Straights with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Earth: Level up Full House for $3\n- Telescope: $10 voucher (don't have enough money)\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\nI just bought The Chariot and need to decide what to do next. My options are:\n\n1. **Use The Chariot now** - I should use it on a card that I rarely or never play, so it stays in hand and provides the X1.5 mult bonus. However, I need to know what cards are in my deck to make this decision. The game state doesn't show my current hand or deck composition.\n\n2. **Reroll the shop** for $5 - This would leave me with $1, which might not be useful. I could potentially find better jokers or cards.\n\n3. **Buy Earth** for $3 - Not useful since I rarely play Full House.\n\n4. **Round Select** - Move on to the next round and use The Chariot during gameplay.\n\nLooking at my strategy:\n- Two Pair is my main hand (played 5 times, Level 3)\n- Straight is my secondary hand (played 3 times, Level 1)\n- Pair is my backup (played 2 times, Level 2)\n\nThe Chariot should be used on a card that I won't typically play in my main hands. Since I focus on Two Pair and Straights, I should avoid enhancing cards that commonly appear in those hands. \n\nI need to see my actual hand before deciding which card to enhance. Moving forward to the next round makes more sense than spending $5 to reroll the shop, especially since that would leave me nearly broke. Earth isn't worth buying given my hand preferences. I'll proceed to the round and apply The Chariot to a card that stays benched, maximizing the Steel Card's X1.5 mult bonus.","action":"\"round_select\""}
