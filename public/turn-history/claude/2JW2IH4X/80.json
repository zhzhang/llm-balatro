{"reasoning":"I'm in a PLANET_PACK game step, meaning I need to select a planet card from the booster pack to level up a hand type.\n\nLet me look at my options:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card (+1 Mult and +10 chips)\n2. Earth - Level up Full House (+2 Mult and +25 chips)\n3. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n\nContext:\n- I'm heading into the Boss Blind which requires playing only ONE hand type\n- My most-played and highest-level hand is Two Pair (Level 4, 80 chips, 5 mult, played 10 times)\n- I need 10,000 chips for the Boss Blind\n\nUnfortunately, none of these planet cards level up Two Pair directly! This is disappointing.\n\nLet me think about which of these options could be most useful:\n\n1. High Card - Level 1 currently (5 chips, 1 mult). Would become 15 chips, 2 mult. This is my backup if I can't make any other hand.\n\n2. Full House - Level 1 currently (40 chips, 4 mult). Would become 65 chips, 6 mult. A full house is harder to make than two pair, but it contains a two pair (three of a kind + pair = full house which contains two pair).\n\n3. Four of a Kind - Level 1 currently (60 chips, 7 mult). Would become 90 chips, 10 mult. This is even harder to make than full house.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the boss constraint. It says \"Play only 1 hand type this round\". This means I need to commit to playing the SAME hand type for every hand I play during the boss round. I can't mix and match.\n\nGiven that:\n- Two Pair is my strongest and most reliable hand\n- I don't have a planet for Two Pair available\n\n\n- I need to pick one hand type to play repeatedly during the boss round\n\nThe real question is whether any of these alternatives could work as a substitute strategy. Full House is interesting because it technically contains two pair within its structure, though I'm not certain if that satisfies the boss requirement. High Card is always available but weak. Four of a Kind would be difficult to assemble consistently. I should think about whether I can even reliably construct Four of a Kind or Full House with my current deck composition.\n\nLooking at what I have left - 40 cards with most ranks appearing 3-5 times, except 3s with only 1 copy and 9s with 2 - Four of a Kind seems unreliable since I'd need four identical cards. Full House is more feasible since I need three of one rank and two of another. But this raises a bigger problem: none of these planets actually improve my Two Pair strategy, which has been working well throughout the game. Since I must choose something from this pack, I need to evaluate which option is least detrimental to my overall approach. So if I commit to Two Pair, that's the only hand type I can play throughout the entire round. Given that Two Pair is already Level 4 and performing well, I should stick with it rather than chase a different hand type. Earth (Full House) still seems like the strongest pick among the available planets—it offers meaningful stat increases and provides a fallback option if my primary strategy falters. I'll go with Earth.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
