{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 5 (in BUFFOON_PACK phase)\n- Money: $5\n- Next up: Boss Blind requiring 1,600 chips (Boss debuffs all Diamond cards)\n- I have 3 jokers currently, max is 5, so 2 empty slots\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card scored\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Joker Stencil: X1 Mult for each empty Joker slot (Currently X2) - This means it would give X2 mult right now since I have 2 empty slots\n2. Shortcut: Allows Straights to be made with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- I've played Straight twice and scored very well (2,314 and 2,403 chips)\n- I've played Two Pair 3 times (at Level 2)\n- I've played Pair 2 times\n- I've played Full House once\n\n**Joker Stencil Analysis:**\n- Currently gives X2 mult with 2 empty slots\n- If I take it, I'll have 4 jokers and 1 empty slot, so it would give X1 mult\n- If I don't fill my joker slots, it can maintain X2 mult\n- This is a multiplicative effect which is generally very powerful\n\n**Shortcut Analysis:**\n- Makes straights easier to form by allowing gaps\n- I've been successfully playing straights already (2,314 and 2,403 chips)\n- This would make straights much more reliable to form\n\n\n- My current jokers synergize well with straights—Odd Todd and Ancient Joker would amplify scoring significantly if I can consistently hit straights with odd cards and spades\n\n.\n\nLet me work through the math more carefully. A 5-card straight using all odd spades would give 185 chips and 8 mult, then multiply by 7.59375 from the Ancient Joker's X1.5 per spade effect, reaching about 11,238 total chips. With Joker Stencil adding an X2 multiplier, that jumps to roughly 22,477 chips.\n\nBut I need to reconsider how the multipliers actually stack—X effects compound together rather than applying sequentially to the base mult. The scoring order matters: base chips and mult calculate first, then card and joker effects layer on top, with X multipliers applying in sequence. check the scoring mechanics more carefully. Independent Jokers activate left-to-right during the mult phase, so the basic Joker's +4 mult and Ancient Joker's multiplier both apply there. Joker Stencil would also activate in that phase, doubling the final mult. The real consideration is whether Shortcut's synergy with my straight-focused strategy—especially given the recent straight flush level-up—provides more value than a flat X2 mult multiplier.\n\nSince I'm already clearing the Boss requirement with 2,300+ chips on straights, Shortcut offers consistency and flexibility. Joker Stencil demands keeping exactly 2 slots empty to maintain X2, which locks me out of future joker purchases if I need scaling. Shortcut lets me adapt my joker composition as the run progresses.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
