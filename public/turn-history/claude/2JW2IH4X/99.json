{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state to determine the best planet card to select from the Celestial Pack.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 13\n- Phase: PLANET_PACK (choosing from Celestial Pack)\n- Money: $25\n- Need to beat Big Blind (16,500 chips) and Boss Blind (44,000 chips)\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 5 (Base Chips 100, Base Mult 6) - Most played (12 times)\n- Flush: Level 2 (Base Chips 50, Base Mult 6) - Just scored 14,030 chips\n- Full House: Level 2 (Base Chips 65, Base Mult 6) - Played 1 time\n- Straight: Level 1 (Base Chips 30, Base Mult 4) - Played 4 times\n\n**Planet Card Choices:**\n1. Uranus - Level up Two Pair: +1 Mult and +20 chips (would go to Level 6: 120 chips, 7 mult)\n2. Saturn - Level up Straight: +3 Mult and +30 chips (would go to Level 2: 60 chips, 7 mult)\n3. Earth - Level up Full House: +2 Mult and +25 chips (would go to Level 3: 90 chips, 8 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI was hoping for a Flush planet to boost the hand that just scored 14,030 chips, but it's not available. Let me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option 1: Uranus (Two Pair)**\n- Two Pair is already Level 5 (most played hand)\n- Would go from 100 chips/6 mult to 120 chips/7 mult\n- Two Pair has been my workhorse hand (12 times played)\n\n\n- Recent scores of 6,431 and 7,031 chips show solid performance, and leveling it up could push those numbers higher with my current joker setup.\n\n**Option 2: Saturn (Straight)**\n- Straight is only Level 1 (30 chips/4 mult)\n- Would go to Level 2 (60 chips/7 mult)\n- The +30 chips and +3 mult represents a massive percentage increase, but straights are much harder to form than Two Pairs, so the practical impact may be limited.\n\n**Option 3: Earth (Full House)**\n- Full House is Level 2 (65 chips/6 mult)\n- Would go to Level 3 (90 chips/8 mult)\n- This hand has only been played once, making it unreliable for consistent scoring.\n\nMy Ancient Joker multiplies by 1.5 for each Diamond (Hearts count as Diamonds with my Smeared Joker), which compounds better with stronger base hands. My last Flush hit 14,030 chips, but I don't have that option available. Two Pair at Level 5 has been my most reliable hand, and upgrading it would strengthen my foundation. The +20 chips and +1 mult gains compound with my joker effects like Odd Todd's +31 chips per odd card and Even Steven's +4 mult per even card, creating significant synergy.\n\nFull House is technically stronger and would score 5 cards instead of Two Pair's 4, triggering more of my card-based effects. But I've only played it once, making Two Pair the safer, more proven choice for consistency.\n\nGiven my scoring targets of 16,500 and 44,000, and that Two Pair consistently delivers 4,000-7,000 chips, upgrading Uranus to level 6 feels like the right move. It's the hand I know works.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
