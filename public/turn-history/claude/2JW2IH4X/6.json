{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (just finished Small Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $2\n- Jokers: Odd Todd (gives +31 chips per odd-ranked card: A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n- Consumables: The Hierophant (enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards for +30 chips each)\n- Max Jokers: 5, Max Consumables: 2\n\n**What's Next:**\n- Big Blind: needs 450 chips\n- Boss Blind: needs 600 chips, discards 2 random cards per hand played\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Drunkard (Joker) - $4 - +1 discard each round (can't afford with $2)\n2. Celestial Pack - $4 - Level up a hand (can't afford)\n3. Grabber (Voucher) - $10 - +1 hand per round (can't afford)\n4. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Available Commands:**\n- use_consumable\n- sell_consumable\n- rearrange_jokers\n- sell_joker\n- buy_card\n- buy_booster\n- buy_voucher\n- buy_and_use_consumable\n- round_select\n- reroll_shop\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $2 remaining, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop (Drunkard costs $4, Celestial Pack $4, Grabber $10, Reroll $5).\n\nMy options are:\n1. Use The Hierophant now - but I'm in the shop, not during a round where I have cards in hand, so I can't use it here\n2. Sell something to afford a purchase - but that seems counterproductive\n3. Proceed to round_select to move on to the Big Blind\n\n\nSince nothing in the shop is within reach, I should move forward to the Big Blind. I'll save The Hierophant for that round—pairing it with Odd Todd means I can boost 2 odd-ranked cards for +61 chips each (the +31 from the joker plus +30 from the consumable). Moving to `round_select` is the right call.","action":"\"round_select\""}
