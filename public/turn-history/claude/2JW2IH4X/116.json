Flush is Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) and has been played 5 times.\n\nMy recent plays show I've been relying heavily on Flush plays, scoring between 11,000-15,000 chips per hand in Ante 5.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Ancient Joker now gives X1.5 mult per HEART (changed from Spade at end of round)\n\n\n2. Since Smeared Joker converts Hearts to Diamonds, those Diamonds also trigger Ancient Joker's multiplier\n3. With $36 available, I can afford several shop items\n\nFor Ante 6, the blind requirements will roughly double. My Flush strategy has been performing well with the Ancient Joker and Smeared Joker synergy, whereas Two Pair scales better additively than multiplicatively. I'm considering whether to upgrade Two Pair with Uranus or invest in boosters to strengthen my hand composition.\n\nThe main options are Gluttonous Joker for Club scaling (though I'd need to sell a joker first since I'm at capacity), Jumbo Celestial Pack to level up Flush or other hands, Spectral Pack for unpredictable effects, or Reroll to search for better offerings. Since Flush remains my strongest scoring engine and I need to prepare for significantly tougher blinds ahead, I should prioritize options that amplify my existing synergies rather than dilute my strategy.\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack seems most reliable—it guarantees a planet card from five options, likely including one that boosts Flush. This would push Flush to Level 3 with improved base values. With $30 left after spending $6, I could still grab Uranus to support Two Pair as a secondary hand, or preserve capital for future shops. Though there's some variance in which planet I receive, the consistency of getting a hand-leveling card outweighs the risk compared to Spectral Pack's unpredictability. I need to evaluate what would help most right now. Ancient Joker's multiplicative scaling with suited cards is powerful—a 5-card Flush in the target suit would hit (1.5)^5 = 7.59375x multiplier. The Jumbo Celestial Pack lets me choose from 5 planet cards to level up whichever hand type I'm weakest in, which should be Flush. That direct improvement to my scoring potential makes it the clear choice over the reroll.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
