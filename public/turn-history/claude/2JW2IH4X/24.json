{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation:\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $9\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n  2. Ancient Joker: Each played card with Club suit gives X1.5 Mult when scored (note: it changed from Spades to Clubs!)\n  3. Joker: +4 Mult\n- Max Jokers: 5 (room for 2 more)\n- No consumables\n\n## Upcoming Blinds:\nFrom the previous blind select:\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed, $5 reward, \"All Diamond cards are debuffed\"\n\n## Shop Options:\nCards:\n1. Reserved Parking - $6 (face cards held in hand have 1/2 chance to give $1)\n2. The Star - $3 (converts up to 3 cards to Diamonds)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Celestial Pack - $4 (choose 1 of 3 Planet cards to use immediately)\n2. Standard Pack - $4 (choose 1 of 3 Playing cards)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Overstock - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n\nReroll: $5\n\n## Analysis:\n\nWith $9, I can afford:\n- Reserved Parking ($6)\n- The Star ($3)\n- Celestial Pack ($4)\n- Standard Pack ($4)\n- One reroll ($5)\n- Combinations like The Star + Celestial Pack ($7)\n- Combinations like The Star + Standard Pack ($7)\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Boss Blind debuffs Diamond cards** - This makes The Star ($3) very unattractive since it converts cards TO Diamonds, which will be debuffed in the boss round.\n\n\n2. **Ancient Joker synergizes with Clubs** - Since it now triggers on Club cards for X1.5 Mult, I should prioritize building around that suit rather than converting to Diamonds. Odd Todd still works well with odd-ranked cards regardless of suit.\n3. **Reserved Parking is costly** - At $6, it leaves minimal budget for other purchases, though holding face cards for passive income could help with scaling.\n4. **Celestial Pack offers hand scaling** - For $4, I can level up a frequently-used hand type. Based on my play history, Two Pair has been my go-to, so upgrading that could significantly boost my scoring potential.\n\nThe Celestial Pack is the strongest choice here. Two Pair at Level 1 gives only 20 base chips and 2 mult, but I've been relying on it consistently. Leveling it up would directly improve my performance against the upcoming Big and Boss blinds, especially since I just scored 812 chips with a Pair and need stronger hand values to keep pace. The Celestial Pack seems like the strongest choice—it directly boosts my scoring potential, which is what I need to clear the upcoming Big Blind and Boss Blind. After spending $4, I'll have $5 remaining for future flexibility if another shop appears.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
