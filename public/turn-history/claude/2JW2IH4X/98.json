{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 13\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $29\n- Just used Temperance to get $13\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Diamond card scored (suit changes at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 16,500 chips\n- Boss Blind: 44,000 chips\n\n**Last Scored Hand:**\n- Flush - 14,030.375 chips\n\n**Shop Items:**\n- Basic Joker - +4 Mult for $2\n- Mega Arcana Pack - $8\n- Celestial Pack - $4\n- Seed Money Voucher - $10\n\n**Interest Calculation:**\nWith $29, I'm earning $5 interest (at $5, $10, $15, $20, $25).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Scoring Gap:**\n   - My Flush scored 14,030 chips\n   - Big Blind needs 16,500 chips (2,470 short)\n   - Boss Blind needs 44,000 chips (29,970 short!)\n   \n2. **What I Need:**\n   - I need to significantly boost my scoring capability\n   - Ancient Joker works with Diamonds/Hearts now (thanks to Smeared)\n   - Two Pair is Level 5 and has been my most played hand\n   - Flush is Level 2 and scored well\n\n3. **Options:**\n   \n   **Option A: Buy Celestial Pack ($4)**\n   - Leaves me with $25 ($5 interest)\n   - Can level up a hand type (likely Flush or Two Pair)\n   - Leveling Flush to Level 3 would increase base chips and mult\n   - This could help me reach the Big Blind threshold\n   \n   **Option B: Buy Seed Money ($10)**\n   - Leaves me with $19 ($3 interest)\n   - Long-term benefit of higher interest cap\n   - But doesn't help immediate scoring problem\n   \n   **Option C: Buy Mega Arcana Pack ($8)**\n   - Leaves me with $21 ($4 interest)\n   - Get a random Tarot card that could provide a significant boost to my hand strength or scoring potential\n   \n   **Option D: Reroll ($5)**\n   - Leaves me with $24 ($4 interest)\n   - Might find better jokers or options\n   \n   **Option E: Just finish shopping**\n   - Keep $29 ($5 interest)\n   - Save money for future rounds\n\nI'm currently short by about 2,470 chips to hit the Big Blind. Upgrading Flush to Level 3 would bump the base chips from 50 to 55 and mult from 6 to 8, which should close some of that gap.\n\nThe real problem is the Boss Blind at 44,000 chips—I'm nearly 30,000 chips short. That's where I need serious scaling improvements. The Celestial Pack seems like my strongest move here. At just $4, it directly boosts my hand strength, and I'd still have $25 left, earning $5 interest for $30 next round. Waiting for better jokers feels risky given how much ground I need to make up. I'm going to grab the Celestial Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
