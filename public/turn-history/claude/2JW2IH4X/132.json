{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante 6/8, Round 16\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $18\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n## Current Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Club (Spades count as Clubs with Smeared)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult from sell values\n4. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n5. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n## Upcoming Challenges\nFrom the context, I know:\n- Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed (Hearts debuffed)\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Misprint - +? (incomplete description) - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\n## What Just Happened\nI just used The World tarot card to convert the Jack of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, and 6 of Hearts to Spades. This means these cards now count as Clubs (via Smeared Joker), so they benefit from Ancient Joker's X1.5 mult. The Jack is particularly valuable because it's odd-ranked, so it gets both +31 chips from Odd Todd AND X1.5 mult from Ancient Joker.\n\n## Current Analysis\n\nI have $18 left. My options are:\n1. Buy Misprint for $4 - Unknown effect, risky\n2. Buy Reroll Surplus for $10 - Makes rerolls cheaper going forward\n3. Reroll shop for $5 - Look for better options\n\n\n4. Round select - Move to next blind\n\nThe conversion I just made has significantly boosted my deck's potential. With Hanging Chad retriggering my first card twice, playing an odd-ranked Spade in a flush means I get the bonus from Odd Todd and Ancient Joker's multiplier applied multiple times. My Small Blind flush already scored 21,260 chips, so I should be approaching the 30,000 chip threshold for the Big Blind.\n\nFor shop purchases, Misprint's unknown effect is risky when I already have a solid synergy, though the $4 cost is manageable. Reroll Surplus would reduce future reroll costs from $5 to $3, but at $10 it's expensive and I'm already at joker capacity. A shop reroll might surface better jokers, though I'm uncertain if I need additional cards given my current setup.\n\nThe best approach is to proceed to round select. I have a strong synergy with my Spade-heavy flush setup and recent improvements, I'm at joker capacity so additional jokers won't help, and banking $18 will generate interest plus extra money from unused hands and discards.","action":"\"round_select\""}
