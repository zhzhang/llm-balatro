{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully:\n\n## Current Status\n- Ante 6/8, Round 16\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $28\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n## My Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - **NOW GIVES X1.5 MULT PER CLUB** (suit changed after last round!)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult from other jokers' sell values\n4. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n5. Lusty Joker - +3 mult per Heart played\n\n## Critical Observation\nAncient Joker's suit changed from Hearts to Clubs! This is a major strategic shift. Now:\n- Ancient Joker gives X1.5 mult per Club\n- With Smeared Joker, Spades also count as Clubs\n- So Spades and Clubs both get the X1.5 mult bonus\n\n## Upcoming Blinds\n- Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed, **All Heart cards are debuffed**\n\nThe Boss Blind debuffing Hearts is actually less problematic now since Ancient Joker switched to Clubs. However, Lusty Joker still relies on Hearts, which will be debuffed by the boss.\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Misprint - +? (incomplete description) - $4\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - $4\n2. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n\n\n3. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\nI cleared the Small Blind last hand with a 21,260-chip Flush. The Ancient Joker's pivot to Clubs means I should focus on building Spade and Club hands to leverage the X1.5 multiplier, especially since the upcoming Boss Blind will weaken Hearts anyway. This shift away from my original Heart/Diamond strategy requires careful consideration of which shop items support a Club-heavy approach going forward.\n\nHanging Chad looks particularly synergistic—retriggering an odd Club or Spade would activate Odd Todd and Ancient Joker multiple times, stacking multipliers effectively. Celestial Pack offers steady scaling by leveling my Flush, while Arcana Pack provides flexibility for suit conversion. Misprint's unclear effect makes it hard to assess its value.\n\nWith $28 available and needing to reach 30,000+ chips for the upcoming blinds, Hanging Chad's multiplicative potential seems most impactful for closing that gap quickly. doesn't apply to Clubs, and Swashbuckler adds 11 mult. The multiplicative boost from Ancient Joker alone—reaching X3.375—could substantially amplify my score.\n\nI'll prioritize Celestial Pack to hunt for Venus and strengthen Flush, then reassess with my remaining $24. If Hanging Chad is still available, I can grab it for $4, or I might reroll for other options.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
