{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Status\n- Ante 6/8, Round 15 (in SHOP phase)\n- Current Money: $19\n- Reroll cost: $6\n\n## My Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Heart (changes suit at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult from other jokers' sell values\n4. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n5. Lusty Joker - +3 mult per Heart played (just bought)\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 mult and +10 chips - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Reroll Surplus - $10\n\n## Analysis\n\nI just bought Lusty Joker for $5, leaving me with $19. Now I have a strong Heart/Diamond synergy:\n- Ancient Joker: X1.5 mult per Heart\n- Lusty Joker: +3 mult per Heart\n- Smeared Joker: Hearts=Diamonds count as same suit\n\nMy primary strategy is playing Flushes (Level 3: 65 chips, 8 mult base).\n\nCurrent shop options:\n1. **Pluto ($3)** - Levels up High Card. This is not useful since I'm focusing on Flush hands, not High Card.\n\n2. **Spectral Pack ($4)** - Could provide powerful effects, but spectral cards are risky and unpredictable. They can have negative effects or effects that don't align with my strategy.\n\n3. **Reroll Surplus ($10)** - Would reduce reroll costs from $6 to $4. This is useful long-term but costs more than I can afford right now.\n   \nI could spend $6 to reroll the shop, leaving $13 to work with, or bank my $19 for $3 interest and start the next round with $22. Since Ante 6 demands 20,000-30,000+ chips and I'm currently scoring 11,000-15,000, I need meaningful upgrades. The shop isn't offering much—Pluto doesn't fit my Flush strategy, and Spectral Pack is too unpredictable. Holding my money seems better than rerolling into potentially weak options. The expected value of a reroll hinges on finding planet cards like Venus for Flush, or discovering better jokers—though my current setup is already solid. At Ante 6, I need significant scaling, and with $19 available, one reroll could reveal something valuable, but I risk wasting $6 if nothing useful appears. I think the safer approach is to move forward and test how well my Heart/Diamond synergy performs in actual play, then reassess if I need more scaling in future shops.\n\nI'm going to proceed to the next round.","action":"\"round_select\""}
