{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $10\n- Next up: Boss Blind (requires playing only 1 hand type) - need 10,000 chips\n\n**Current Jokers (5/5 slots full):**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3) - sells for $2\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Heart card scored - sells for $4\n3. Swashbuckler - +10 Mult (from sell values: 2+4+2+2 = 10) - sells for $2\n4. Blue Joker - +104 chips - sells for $2\n5. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored - sells for $2\n\n**Shop:**\n- Madness: X0.5 Mult when blind selected, destroys random joker - $7 (TERRIBLE)\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Seed Money voucher: $10\n- Reroll: $5\n\nI just bought Even Steven and now have both Odd Todd and Even Steven, giving me flexibility to play either odd or even cards in my Two Pairs.\n\nLet me think about what I should do now:\n\n**Options:**\n1. Buy Seed Money for $10 - This raises interest cap from $5 to $10. Currently I have $10, so I'd get $2 interest instead of $2 interest... wait, let me think. With $10, I'd get $10/5 = $2 interest currently. If I buy Seed Money, I'd have $0 left and get no interest. This doesn't help me right now.\n\n2. Reroll for $5 - I'd have $5 left, which would give me $1 interest. This could reveal better jokers or consumables.\n\n\n3. Standard Pack costs $4 and adds a card to my deck, but I'm already at 52 cards—diluting the deck further seems counterproductive unless I need specific cards for scoring.\n4. Proceeding to round_select makes sense given my solid joker composition. Let me verify what I can score with this setup.\n\n**Expected scoring with Two Pair using 4 even cards:**\n- Base chips: 80\n- Blue Joker adds 104 chips\n- Card values from the 4 even cards contribute roughly 20 chips\n- Total chips around 204\n\n- Base mult: 5\n- Swashbuckler: +10 mult\n- Even Steven: +16 mult (4 cards × 4)\n- Total mult: 31\n- If 2 Hearts: 31 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 69.75 mult\n- Final: 204 × 69.75 = ~14,229 chips\n\n**Expected scoring with Two Pair using 4 odd cards:**\n- Base chips: 80\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Odd Todd: +124 chips (4 odd cards × 31)\n- Card values: ~20 chips\n- Total chips: ~328\n\n- Base mult: 5\n- Swashbuckler: +10 mult\n- Total mult: 15\n- If 2 Hearts: 15 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 33.75 mult\n- Final: 328 × 33.75 = ~11,070 chips\n\nBoth approaches clear the 10,000 threshold comfortably, so I'm ready to move forward.\n\nWith $10 remaining, I could keep it for $2 interest at round's end, spend it on Seed Money to boost my interest cap, or use $5 for a reroll. A reroll might uncover better jokers or planet cards to level up Two Pair further, but there's real risk in not finding anything useful. Since my current setup already handles the Boss Blind decisively, the safer choice is holding onto the cash and advancing.\n\nLooking ahead though—I'm only at Ante 4 of 8, and the chip requirements will keep climbing. Seed Money would strengthen my long-term economy by doubling my interest cap, but spending all $10 leaves me with nothing to earn interest on next round. If I keep the $10 instead, I'll have around $13-15 after the Boss round between interest and bonuses, versus maybe $3 if I spend everything on Seed Money now.\n\nOver the remaining 4 Antes, Seed Money could theoretically generate an extra $3 per round in interest, but that assumes I maintain high cash reserves—which is unlikely given how much I'll need to spend on jokers and upgrades. The immediate capital seems more practical than betting on future returns.\n\nI'll move forward and hold onto my money for now.","action":"\"round_select\""}
