{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8 (need to beat 3 more antes)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $16\n- Two Pair is now Level 5 (100 base chips, 6 base mult) after buying Uranus\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored\n3. Swashbuckler - +10 Mult (adds sell value of other jokers)\n4. Blue Joker - +104 chips (52 cards × 2)\n5. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored\n\n**Shop Items:**\n1. Smeared Joker - $7 (Hearts/Diamonds same, Spades/Clubs same)\n2. Mega Arcana Pack - $8\n3. Standard Pack - $4\n4. Seed Money Voucher - $10\n\n**My Previous Plan:**\nI was planning to:\n1. Buy Uranus ($3) ✓ DONE\n2. Sell Blue Joker (+$2)\n3. Buy Smeared Joker ($7)\n4. This would leave me with $11 ($16 - $7 + $2 = $11)\n\n**Analysis of Smeared Joker:**\nThe Smeared Joker makes Spades and Clubs count as the same suit. Since Ancient Joker currently gives X1.5 Mult per Club card, with Smeared Joker, Spades would also count as Clubs and trigger this effect.\n\nCurrently in my deck:\n- Clubs: ~13 cards (1/4 of deck)\n- Spades: ~13 cards (1/4 of deck)\n\nWith Smeared Joker, effectively ~26 cards (half the deck) would trigger Ancient Joker's X1.5 mult effect. \n\nDoubling the cards that activate the multiplier is substantial. The trade-off involves losing Blue Joker's flat +104 chips against gaining multiplicative scaling from Smeared Joker expanding Ancient Joker's reach. In a Two Pair hand with 4 cards, having both Clubs and Spades count toward the X1.5 mult creates exponential growth rather than additive gains—the multiplier compounds with each additional card that qualifies.\n\nWith 2-4 qualifying cards, the multiplier could reach X2.25 to X5.0625, which applied to a typical mult of 20-30 would generate far more chips than the static bonus from Blue Joker. This suggests the Smeared Joker swap is worth evaluating against actual hand calculations.\n\nTesting a Two Pair Level 5 scenario: roughly 286 total chips (from base, Odd Todd, and Blue Joker contributions) combined with a base mult around 24 (accounting for Swashbuckler and Even Steven). A single Club trigger yields 10,296 chips, while two Clubs push it to 15,444. Adding Spades into the mix via Smeared could push the multiplier even higher, potentially exceeding what Blue Joker alone provides.\n\nThe real advantage emerges with four triggering cards—hitting 121.5x multiplier and 22,113 chips even after losing Blue Joker's contribution. The multiplicative scaling from Smeared Joker stacking with Ancient Joker creates significantly more value than keeping the flat chip boost. I'm committing to the swap: selling Blue Joker for $2, purchasing Smeared Joker for $7, which leaves me with a net cost of $5.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
