{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6 (in PLANET_PACK phase)\n- Money: $10\n- I just bought a Celestial Pack and need to choose one of three planet cards\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Heart card scored (suit changed from Spades to Hearts)\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut: Allows Straights to be made with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Planet Card Choices:**\n1. Neptune: Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips (currently Level 2)\n2. Earth: Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips (currently Level 1)\n3. Jupiter: Level up Flush +2 Mult and +15 chips (currently Level 1)\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Straight: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 4, Times Played 3 (my most played hand!)\n- Straight Flush: Level 2, Base Chips 140, Base Mult 12, Times Played 0\n- Full House: Level 1, Base Chips 40, Base Mult 4, Times Played 1\n- Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4, Times Played 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis is unfortunate - none of the planet cards are for Straight, which is my most played hand type (3 times). The available options are:\n1. Straight Flush - already at Level 2, would go to Level 3\n2. Full House - at Level 1, would go to Level 2\n3. Flush - at Level 1, would go to Level 2\n\n\nSince there's no planet for regular Straight, I need to evaluate which alternative offers the most value. Neptune would upgrade Straight Flush from Level 2 to Level 3 (gaining 40 chips and 4 mult), but I haven't successfully played a straight flush yet. The Shortcut joker helps with straights, though making a suited sequence is still challenging. If I could construct a Heart straight flush, the Ancient Joker's 1.5x multiplier per Heart would significantly amplify the score.\n\nEarth upgrades Full House from Level 1 to Level 2 (25 chips, 2 mult). This hand is more achievable since I've already played it once, and with Odd Todd in play, any odd-ranked cards in the trips or pair would generate +31 chips each. Jupiter upgrades Flush from Level 1 to Level 2 (15 chips, 2 mult), but I haven't played any flushes and it requires five cards of the same suit.\n\nA Heart flush becomes particularly attractive with Ancient Joker active this round—each Heart card multiplies by 1.5, giving me a (1.5)^5 = 7.59x multiplier. Straight Flush remains my strongest option if I can assemble it, especially with Shortcut allowing gaps to make it more feasible. A Heart straight flush with Ancient Joker would be devastating. However, Flush is the more reliable path since I only need five Hearts rather than five in sequence.\n\nComparing my options: Straight Flush offers maximum power but demands precise card alignment. Flush is significantly easier to construct while still delivering strong multiplier scaling through Ancient Joker. Full House with Odd Todd is viable but less synergistic. Since I'm already committed to leveraging Ancient Joker's Heart boost, Jupiter (Flush) gives me a dependable second strategy that doesn't require the strict sequencing constraints of Straight Flush. The Level 2 Straight Flush is already solid, so investing in Flush diversifies my hand options while capitalizing on my current Joker setup. powerful. A regular Flush only requires 5 Hearts without needing a sequence, making it significantly easier to achieve. While the base stats are lower than a Straight Flush after leveling, the Ancient Joker multiplier applies equally, and the practical advantage of a simpler hand to construct outweighs the higher potential of the harder-to-achieve Straight Flush. I'll go with Jupiter.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
