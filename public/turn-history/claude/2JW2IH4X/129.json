{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully:\n\n## Current Situation\n- Ante 6/8, Round 16\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $26\n- Reroll cost: $5\n- Just sold Lusty Joker for $2 (was $24, now $26)\n\n## Current Jokers (4/5 - one slot free)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Club (Spades count as Clubs with Smeared)\n3. Swashbuckler - +9 mult (reduced from +11 after selling Lusty Joker)\n4. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n## Upcoming Challenges\n- Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed (Hearts debuffed)\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Misprint - +? (incomplete description) - $4\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\n## Strategy Analysis\n\nMy previous reasoning was to buy Hanging Chad after selling Lusty Joker. Let me verify if this is still the best move:\n\n**Hanging Chad Analysis:**\n- Retriggers first played card 2 additional times\n- If I play an odd-ranked Club/Spade first:\n  - Card plays 3 times total\n  - Each time: +31 chips from Odd Todd\n  - Each time: X1.5 mult from Ancient Joker\n  - Total multiplier: X1.5 × X1.5 × X1.5 = X3.375 from that one card\n\n\n- This creates exceptional scaling with the Club synergy. Hanging Chad is the strongest immediate power spike available.\n\n**Misprint and Arcana Pack** are too uncertain—Misprint's effect is unclear, and Arcana Pack's outcome is unpredictable. **Reroll Surplus** doesn't justify $10 when I need raw power now. Hanging Chad directly amplifies my existing synergies and pushes me toward the upcoming blinds.\n\nAfter securing it for $4, I'll have $22 remaining. I can either grab Arcana Pack to explore additional effects, reroll to hunt for stronger options, or bank the capital for the next round. The multiplicative gains from Hanging Chad alone make this the priority move.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
