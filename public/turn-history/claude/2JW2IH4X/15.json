{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2 (just completed Big Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $0 (just spent $8 on Ancient Joker)\n- Jokers owned: Odd Todd and Ancient Joker\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: Each played Club card gives X1.5 Mult when scored (suit changes at end of round)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Blackboard: X3 Mult if all held cards are Spades or Clubs - $6 (can't afford)\n- Celestial Pack: $4 (can't afford)\n- Jumbo Celestial Pack: $6 (can't afford)\n- Grabber voucher: +1 hand per round - $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI have $0, so I cannot buy anything else in this shop. The only action available to me is to proceed to the next phase, which would be round selection (likely the Boss Blind since I've completed Small and Big Blinds).\n\nSince I can't afford any purchases and have already bought Ancient Joker, the logical next step is to use the `round_select` command to move forward to the next blind selection.\n\nMy current setup:\n- Odd Todd provides consistent chip boosts for odd cards\n- Ancient Joker will provide multiplicative scaling for Club cards (currently active suit)\n- This combination should help me tackle the Boss Blind\n\nThe action should be: round_select","action":"\"round_select\""}
