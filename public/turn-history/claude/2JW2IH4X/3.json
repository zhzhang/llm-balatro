{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $9\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Just beat the Small Blind\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. The Hierophant (Tarot) - $3 - Enhances 2 selected cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n2. Drunkard (Joker) - $4 - +1 discard each round\n3. Buffoon Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n4. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n5. Grabber (Voucher) - $10 - Permanently gain +1 hand per round\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 450 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, discards 2 random cards per hand played\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $9 to spend. The upcoming Big Blind needs 450 chips, which is significantly more than the 300 I just dealt with. The Boss Blind is even harder at 600 chips AND it discards 2 random cards per hand played, which is very punishing.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n1. **The Hierophant ($3)** - This enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards which give +30 chips each. This is solid, as it permanently improves my deck. With $6 left after buying, I could get Drunkard too.\n\n2. **Drunkard ($4)** - +1 discard is useful, especially with the boss blind coming up. Having extra discards helps manage the 2 random card discard effect.\n\n3. **Buffoon Pack ($4)** - This gives me a choice of jokers, which could be very valuable. Getting a good joker early is crucial.\n\n\n4. **Celestial Pack ($4)** - Leveling up a hand type immediately could help. Since I've already played Two Pair and Full House, upgrading Full House would strengthen my scoring significantly.\n\n5. **Grabber ($10)** - Out of reach for now.\n\nThe boss blind's card discard mechanic is particularly threatening. I need hands that maintain strength even with fewer cards in play, and extra discards from Drunkard would help mitigate that pressure. Jokers that generate chips independently of card composition would also be valuable here.\n\nI'm leaning toward the **Buffoon Pack ($4)** as my first purchase—getting a joker early provides flexibility and leaves me $5 to work with. From there, I could grab The Hierophant ($3) for card enhancement, Drunkard ($4) for discard protection, or save the remaining funds for a reroll to see what else becomes available. The combination of Drunkard and The Hierophant together would cost $7, which is also worth considering if I want both defensive and offensive upgrades.\n\nSince the boss blind discards 2 cards per hand, Drunkard's extra discards become particularly valuable. However, jokers tend to be the most impactful early-run purchases for scaling, so securing one through the Buffoon Pack seems like the stronger opening move.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
