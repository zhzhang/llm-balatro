{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $10\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Heart card scored (suit changes at end of round)\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut: Allows Straights to be made with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Blind Options:**\n\n1. **Current (Small) Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 2,000\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Skip Tag: Voucher Tag (Adds one Voucher to next shop)\n\n2. **Upcoming (Big) Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 3,000\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Skip Tag: Rare Tag (Shop has a free Rare Joker)\n\n3. **Upcoming (Boss) Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 4,000\n   - Boss Description: -1 Hand Size\n   - Reward: $5\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Last played hand scored 3,686 chips on Ante 2 Boss Blind (which only needed 1,600)\n- I've been consistently playing Straights and have been successful\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance, I scored 3,686 chips on the Ante 2 Boss Blind which only required 1,600 chips - I massively overshot it. The Small Blind now needs 2,000 chips, which should be easily achievable given my current setup.\n\nMy strategy has been working well:\n- Straights with Shortcut (allowing gaps)\n- Odd Todd giving +31 chips per odd card\n\n\n- Ancient Joker multiplying by 1.5 for each Heart, plus I just leveled Flush to Level 2\n\n**Should I skip or play?**\n\nPlaying the Small Blind seems straightforward given my past results, but skipping would grant a Voucher Tag for the next shop, which could be valuable for future purchases. The $3 reward is modest compared to what a Voucher might unlock later.\n\nComparing the skip options: a Voucher Tag adds one voucher to my next shop visit, saving me $10 if I'd normally buy one. But the Big Blind skip offers a Rare Tag instead—a free Rare Joker worth $6. The Rare Tag appears more immediately impactful since it's a guaranteed high-value card, whereas the Voucher Tag's benefit depends on whether I actually want to purchase a voucher.\n\nPlaying Small Blind now makes sense because I can comfortably meet the 2,000 chip threshold, I'll gain $3 and access another shop, and it keeps my options open for the Big Blind decision. If I skip Small Blind for the Voucher Tag, I lose that $3 reward and shopping opportunity without a clear advantage. The better move is to take the Small Blind, then reassess whether the free Rare Joker from skipping Big Blind justifies missing that blind's rewards.","action":"\"play_round\""}
