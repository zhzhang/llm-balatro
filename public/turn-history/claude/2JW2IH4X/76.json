{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $8\n- Need to decide: Play Big Blind (7500 chips) or Skip for Ethereal Tag (free Spectral Pack)\n- Next is Boss Blind (10000 chips) - \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd ranks (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club suit card scored\n3. Shortcut - Straights with gaps of 1 rank\n4. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult\n5. Blue Joker - +104 chips\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4, 80 chips, 5 mult (most played - 9 times)\n- Pair: Level 2, 25 chips, 3 mult (played 4 times)\n- Straight: Level 1, 30 chips, 4 mult (played 4 times)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Big Blind requires 7500 chips. Let me calculate if I can beat it:\n\nFor a Two Pair hand:\n- Base: 80 chips + 5 mult\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips → 184 chips\n- If I play two odd cards in the pair: +62 chips → 246 chips\n- Card values (estimate ~20-40 chips for participating cards): ~280 chips total\n- Base mult: 5\n- Swashbuckler: +11 mult → 16 mult total\n- If I have 2 clubs in the scored hand: X1.5 X1.5 = X2.25 → 16 * 2.25 = 36 mult\n\n\n- Total: 280 chips * 36 mult = 10,080 chips\n\nThis comfortably clears the 7500 requirement. The Boss Blind constraint of playing only one hand type actually works in my favor since Two Pair is my strongest option and most developed hand. With Blue Joker, Odd Todd, and Ancient Joker all synergizing well, I can reliably hit the 10000 chip threshold by focusing exclusively on Two Pair.\n\nThe Ethereal Tag grants a free Spectral Pack, which could offer useful effects despite potential downsides. However, the real advantage here is that beating the Big Blind nets me $4 plus a shop visit before facing the Boss—skipping would leave me with only $8 and no opportunity to strengthen my position. Playing through gives me access to consumables or better options, making it the clear choice.","action":"\"play_round\""}
