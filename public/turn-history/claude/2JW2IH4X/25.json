{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase where I need to choose one of three planet cards:\n\n1. Uranus - Levels up Two Pair (+1 Mult and +20 chips)\n2. Mars - Levels up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n3. Pluto - Levels up High Card (+1 Mult and +10 chips)\n\nLooking at my hand history:\n- Two Pair: Played 3 times (most recent: 360, 292, 120 chips)\n- Pair: Played 2 times (most recent: 812, 232 chips)\n- Full House: Played 1 time (224 chips)\n- Straight: Played 1 time (2,403 chips)\n- Four of a Kind: Never played\n- High Card: Never played\n\nCurrent hand levels:\n- Two Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 60, Base Mult 7\n- High Card: Level 1, Base Chips 5, Base Mult 1\n\nUpcoming blinds:\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed (All Diamond cards are debuffed)\n\nMy jokers:\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: Each played card with Club suit gives X1.5 Mult when scored\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n\nAnalysis:\n- Two Pair has been my most consistently played hand (3 times), so Uranus would be the most useful\n- Four of a Kind is very rare to get, so Mars would be less useful even though it gives bigger bonuses\n- High Card is almost never intentionally played, so Pluto would be nearly useless\n\n\n- Leveling Two Pair to Level 2 would increase it to 40 chips and 3 mult, providing a meaningful boost for my most reliable hand type to handle the upcoming blinds. I'll select Uranus.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
