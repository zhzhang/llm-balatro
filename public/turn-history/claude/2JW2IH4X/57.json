{"reasoning":"I'm in a TAROT_PACK phase where I need to select one of three tarot cards from an Arcana Pack:\n\n1. **The Hermit** - Doubles money (Max of $20). I currently have $5, so this would give me $10.\n\n2. **Strength** - Increases rank of up to 2 selected cards by 1. This can turn cards into higher ranks, which could help with making better hands.\n\n3. **The Devil** - Enhances 1 selected card into a Gold Card (gives $3 if held in hand at end of round).\n\nLet me think about what's best for my strategy:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- About to face Boss Blind (Ante 3/8)\n- Current money: $5\n- Jokers focused on: Odd Todd (+31 chips for odd ranks), Ancient Joker (X1.5 Mult per Diamond), Swashbuckler (+10 Mult from sell values), Basic Joker (+4 Mult), Shortcut (straights with gaps)\n- Most played hand: Two Pair (Level 3)\n- Recent Two Pair scores: 1,600-1,820 chips\n\n**Analysis of each option:**\n\n1. **The Hermit**: Would give me $10 total. Not immediately useful for the Boss Blind, but might help in the next shop phase. However, I'm not hurting for money right now, and I need to focus on beating the Boss Blind.\n\n2. **Strength**: Can upgrade 2 cards by 1 rank. Looking at my current hand:\n   - 8 of Spades → 9 (odd, would trigger Odd Todd)\n   - Ace of Hearts → Can't upgrade (already highest)\n   - 10 of Hearts → Jack\n   - 7 of Hearts → 8 (would lose odd bonus)\n   - 10 of Clubs → Jack\n   - 9 of Clubs → 10 (would lose odd bonus)\n   - 4 of Clubs → 5 (would keep odd bonus)\n   - 3 of Diamonds → 4 (would lose odd bonus)\n\nThe best targets seem to be upgrading the 8 of Spades to a 9 for the Odd Todd synergy, or the 4 of Clubs to a 5 to maintain the odd bonus while boosting chip value. Rank increases could also help me form stronger hands more consistently across the deck.\n\n3. **The Devil**: Gold Card enhancement gives $3 when held at round's end—useful for money generation but doesn't address the immediate Boss Blind challenge.\n\nFor this fight, I need raw scoring power. Both The Hermit and The Devil lean toward long-term economy, which won't cut it here. Strength is the real option because it can convert even-numbered cards to odd ones (triggering Odd Todd) and improve my hand-making potential. Given my deck relies on Two Pair and Odd Todd synergy, I should prioritize upgrades that hit both: cards becoming odd while also supporting better pair formation. only upgrade 2 cards from my current hand, not from the entire deck. So this will only affect the specific cards in my hand right now.\n\nGiven that constraint, Strength seems less impactful than The Hermit, which would give me an extra $5 for future purchases. But that money won't help me during this round—I need to focus on beating the Boss Blind itself. The Devil adds some value with a Gold Card effect, though it's modest. Strength could actually matter most if I draw those upgraded cards during the Boss Blind and they help me score better.\n\nI'll upgrade the 8 of Spades to a 9 (making it odd to trigger Odd Todd) and the 4 of Clubs to a 5. This gives me more odd-rank cards to leverage during the Boss Blind.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,7]"}
