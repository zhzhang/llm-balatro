{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Boss Blind: Play only 1 hand type this round\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Money: $10\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 3 of Spades (odd) - +3 chips\n2. Jack of Hearts (even) - +10 chips\n3. 3 of Hearts (odd) - +3 chips\n4. Queen of Clubs (even) - +10 chips\n5. Queen of Diamonds (even) - +10 chips\n6. 10 of Diamonds (even) - +10 chips\n7. 3 of Diamonds (odd) - +3 chips\n8. 2 of Diamonds (even) - +2 chips\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Heart card scored\n3. Swashbuckler - +10 Mult\n4. Blue Joker - +74 chips (37 cards remaining × 2)\n5. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n\n**Possible hands:**\n- Three of a Kind with 3s (positions 1, 3, 7) - 1 Heart (position 3)\n- Pair of Queens (positions 4, 5)\n- Two Pair: Queens + 3s (but I'd be playing 5 cards, and I need to pick the best 4)\n\nWait, I have THREE 3s! That's a Three of a Kind. But I've committed to Two Pair based on my previous plays. Since this is a Boss Blind requiring only ONE hand type, I need to stick with what I've been playing.\n\n\nSince I've been playing Two Pair consistently, I should continue with that pattern. The best combinations would be Queens paired with two of my three 3s—either using the Heart 3 for the Ancient Joker multiplier, or the other 3s depending on which maximizes my chip output.\n\nIf I go with positions 3, 4, 5, 7 (3 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds), I get the base 80 chips from my Two Pair Level 4, plus 26 chips from the card values themselves. The Odd Todd bonus triggers on both 3s for an additional 62 chips, and the Blue Joker adds 74 chips on top of that.\n\nFor multipliers, I have the base 5 from Two Pair Level 4, Swashbuckler gives me 10 more, and Even Steven triggers on the two Queens for 8 additional mult. That puts me at 23 mult before Ancient Joker activates—and since the 3 of Hearts is a Heart, it multiplies my total mult by 1.5, bringing it to 34.5. This gives me 242 × 34.5 = 8,349 chips, which still falls short of 10,000.\n\nI need to reconsider my approach here. There's something about the boss blind rule I'm not accounting for correctly—it mentions playing only 1 hand, which might change my strategy entirely.\n\nActually, I realize I haven't played any hands yet this round, only discarded. That means I can select any hand type I want, but once I commit to it, I'm locked in for the rest of the round. Let me explore Three of a Kind instead, using all three 3s from positions 1, 3, and 7. The base chips from Three of a Kind Level 1 is 30, and the three 3s themselves contribute 9 chips. Odd Todd triggers since all three 3s are odd, giving me 93 additional chips, plus Blue Joker adds another 74 chips, bringing my total chips to 30 + 9 + 93 + 74 = 206 chips before considering multipliers.\n\nFor multipliers, Three of a Kind Level 1 gives me 3 base mult, Swashbuckler adds 10 mult, and Even Steven contributes nothing since none of the 3s are even. That's 13 mult total. Ancient Joker then multiplies this by 1.5 since the 3 of Hearts is a heart, giving me 19.5 mult. My final score would be 206 × 19.5 = 4,017 chips—significantly worse than Two Pair. I should reconsider Two Pair instead, particularly since both the 3 of Hearts and Jack of Hearts are hearts, which could maximize my scoring potential with the heart-based multipliers I have available. of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds gives me 1 Heart, same as using 3 of Hearts with 3 of Spades. Either pairing works equally well for the Ancient Joker multiplier.\n\nI'll go with 3 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds in positions 3, 4, 5, 7. That gets me to 8,349 chips. Since I'm still below 10,000 with discards and hands remaining, I should consider whether pushing for a stronger hand is worth the risk.\n\nIf I could get another Heart into the Two Pair, I'd stack ×1.5 from the Heart joker with ×1.5 from another source, giving ×2.25 total. That would push me to over 12,500 chips. So discarding to chase more Hearts makes sense. I need to keep my Queens and the 3 of Hearts, which means ditching the 3 of Spades and reconsidering the Jack of Hearts—actually, wait, the Jack might be more valuable than I initially thought.\n\nLooking at this more carefully, I need exactly 4 cards for Two Pair: two Queens and two 3s. To maximize the Heart bonus, I'd need at least one of those pairs to be Hearts. The Jack of Hearts doesn't help form the pairs I need, so even though it's a Heart, it won't contribute to the multiplier unless I'm willing to break my Two Pair hand.\n\nCurrently among my pair candidates, only the 3 of Hearts qualifies as both part of my needed pairs and a Heart. To get a second Heart into the Two Pair, I'd need to draw either a Queen of Hearts or another 3 of Hearts. With 11 Hearts left in the deck and only 2 remaining Queens and a limited number of 3s, the odds of drawing the specific Heart I need are relatively low. I should focus on securing the Two Pair itself first, since that's the primary hand I'm building toward. so I need four cards total for Two Pair. I have three 3s across positions 1, 3, and 7, plus two Queens at positions 4 and 5. I'll keep one 3 along with both Queens, discarding the 3 of Spades, Jack of Hearts, 10 of Diamonds, and 2 of Diamonds. Though actually, with 8,349 chips already and only needing 1,651 more from my remaining three hands, I might just play this hand as-is rather than risk the draw.\n\nWait—this is a Boss Blind that locks me into one hand type for all remaining plays. If I commit to Two Pair now, every subsequent hand must also be Two Pair. Given that constraint and the fact that I'm already close to the 10,000 target, playing the current hand makes sense. I'll go with positions 3, 4, 5, and 7 for my Two Pair.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,7]"}
