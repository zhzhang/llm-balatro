{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation:\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $13\n- I just beat the Big Blind with a Straight scoring 2,314 chips\n- Next up is the Boss Blind which requires 1,600 chips and debuffs all Diamond cards\n\n## My Jokers:\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card scored (suit changed from Clubs to Spades at end of round)\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n\n## Shop Options:\nShop Cards:\n1. To Do List: Earn $4 if poker hand is a Full House, changes at end of round - Cost: $4\n2. Greedy Joker: Played Diamond cards give +3 Mult - Cost: $5\n\nShop Boosters:\n1. Buffoon Pack (2 Joker choices) - Cost: $4\n2. Celestial Pack (3 Planet card choices to use immediately) - Cost: $4\n\nShop Vouchers:\n1. Overstock: +1 card slot in shop - Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThe Boss Blind debuffs all Diamond cards, so Greedy Joker would be useless for the Boss fight. To Do List could be useful if I can consistently make Full Houses, but Full Houses are harder to form than Pairs or Two Pairs.\n\nMy current joker setup is working well:\n- Odd Todd gives significant chip bonuses\n- Ancient Joker now works with Spades (X1.5 per Spade)\n- Basic Joker gives +4 Mult\n\nI just scored 2,314 chips with a Straight, which is well above the 1,600 needed for the Boss. However, the Boss debuffs Diamonds, which means any Diamond cards in my deck won't score their chip values or trigger effects when played.\n\n\nWith $13 available, I can pick up either the Celestial Pack or Buffoon Pack for $4 each, leaving me with flexibility. The Buffoon Pack would add another joker to my arsenal, potentially giving me more multiplicative power for the Boss fight. The Celestial Pack would let me upgrade hand types immediately, which could help me score higher on the Boss. To Do List is tempting for money generation, but Full Houses are inconsistent to hit compared to other hands.\n\nSince I already cleared the threshold with 2,314 chips on a Straight, I'm thinking the Celestial Pack is the safer play—leveling up Two Pair or Straight directly boosts my scoring without relying on finding the right joker. The Boss debuffs Diamonds, so having stronger base hand values matters more than chasing specific joker synergies.\n\nI could theoretically chain purchases—Celestial Pack for $4, then Buffoon Pack for another $4—but the guaranteed hand upgrade feels more valuable than the randomness of joker pulls. I'll go with the Celestial Pack first.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
