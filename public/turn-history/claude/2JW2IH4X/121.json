{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current Status\n- Ante 6/8, Round 15\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $22\n- Reroll cost increased to $6 (from $5)\n\n## My Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Heart (changes suit at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult from other jokers' sell values\n4. Even Steven - +4 mult per even card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n## NEW Shop Options (after reroll)\nCards:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 mult and +10 chips - $3\n2. Lusty Joker - +3 mult per Heart played - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Reroll Surplus - $10\n\n## Analysis\n\nThis is a MUCH better shop! Lusty Joker gives +3 mult per Heart played, which synergizes perfectly with Ancient Joker (X1.5 mult per Heart). With Smeared Joker, Hearts=Diamonds, so I effectively can count both Hearts AND Diamonds as Hearts for both jokers.\n\nLet me calculate the potential:\n- Playing a Flush with 5 Hearts/Diamonds:\n  - Base: 65 chips, 8 mult (Flush Level 3)\n  - Each card adds chips based on rank (Odd Todd for odd, Even Steven for even)\n  - Ancient Joker: X1.5 mult per Heart = X1.5^5 = X7.59375 mult\n  - Lusty Joker would add +15 mult (3 per Heart), and Swashbuckler contributes +11 mult from the sell values of my other jokers.\n\nThe synergy is powerful, but I'm at max capacity. I need to decide which joker to sacrifice. Odd Todd provides additive chip scaling, which is less valuable than the multiplicative effects I'd gain. Ancient Joker is non-negotiable since it's my core multiplier engine. Swashbuckler's contribution depends on what I sell, so that's worth considering carefully.\n\nEven Steven and Odd Todd both offer additive bonuses that pale compared to multiplicative scaling. If I sell either for $2, I'd reach $24—enough for Lusty Joker with $19 remaining. Swashbuckler is also $2, but selling it would reduce the sell values that feed into my other jokers' effects, creating a cascading loss. Smeared Joker is essential for my strategy, so that's off the table.\n\nThe choice comes down to whether Odd Todd or Even Steven is more expendable, since both provide weaker additive scaling compared to what I'd gain from Lusty Joker's multiplicative boost. Odd Todd could contribute up to 155 chips if all cards are odd, while Even Steven would only add 20 mult with all even cards. The chip boost from Odd Todd seems more impactful than Even Steven's mult, so selling Even Steven makes sense to free up space for Lusty Joker.\n\nAfter selling Even Steven for $2, I'd have $24 total. Buying Lusty Joker for $5 leaves me with $19. I'm weighing whether the +3 mult per Heart justifies the purchase, or if I should reroll or save the money instead.\n\nWith 5 Hearts in a Flush, Lusty Joker adds +15 mult. Ancient Joker multiplies that by X7.59 on the same hand. My current Ancient Joker setup generates 11,000-15,000 chips, but Ante 6 will demand 20,000-30,000+. The additional mult from Lusty Joker, combined with Ancient Joker's exponential scaling, could push me over that threshold. The Heart/Diamond synergy with Ancient Joker, Lusty Joker, and Smeared Joker is worth pursuing. I'll sell Even Steven and buy Lusty Joker, leaving $19 for potentially one more reroll.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
