{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation:\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $5\n- Jokers (3/5):\n  1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n  2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Club card scored\n  3. Joker: +4 Mult\n\n## Big Blind Decision:\n- Chips Needed: 1200\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Uncommon Tag (free Uncommon Joker in shop)\n\n## Boss Blind (upcoming):\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Boss Description: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\n## My Recent Performance:\n- Last hand (Pair in Small Blind): 812 chips - easily exceeded requirements\n- Previous Straight in Boss: 2,403 chips\n- Two Pair scoring: 360, 292, 120 chips\n\n## Hand Levels:\n- Two Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 40, Base Mult 3 (just upgraded!)\n- Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 10, Base Mult 2\n- Other hands at Level 1\n\n## Analysis:\n\n### Option 1: Play the Big Blind\nPros:\n- I just scored 812 chips with a Pair, which is very strong\n- Two Pair is now Level 2 (40 chips, 3 mult base)\n- I need 1200 chips, which seems achievable with my current setup\n- I'd earn $4 + interest on remaining money\n- Ancient Joker gives X1.5 mult per Club card\n- Odd Todd gives +31 chips per odd rank card\n\nCons:\n- Risk of losing if I don't get good hands\n\n\n- Playing hands consumes my limited discards\n\n### Option 2: Skip for the Uncommon Tag\nPros:\n- Get a free Uncommon Joker in the shop\n- No risk of losing\n- Could get a powerful joker to help with Boss blind\n\nCons:\n- No $4 reward\n- No interest earned\n- Have to face the Boss blind next with current setup\n- Boss blind debuffs Diamonds, which is challenging\n\nLet me calculate expected scoring:\n\nWith Two Pair Level 2 (40 base chips, 3 base mult):\n- If I play 2 odd rank cards + 2 more odd rank cards (like 3-3-5-5):\n  - Base: 40 chips, 3 mult\n  - Each odd card adds 31 chips from Odd Todd\n  - 4 cards × 31 = 124 extra chips\n  - Total: 164 chips\n  - If they're Clubs, each Club gives X1.5 mult (4 Clubs = 3 * 1.5^4 = 3 * 5.0625 = 15.1875 mult)\n  - Plus basic Joker +4 mult = 19.1875 mult\n  - 164 × 19.1875 = 3,146 chips (way more than needed!)\n\nEven without all Clubs, Two Pair with 4 odd cards gives me 164 chips, and with just 2 Clubs I'm already at a solid multiplier that easily clears the blind.\n\nI'm confident I can beat 1200 chips. The free Uncommon Joker is tempting, but I don't know what I'd get, I'd lose the $4 reward, and I'd have less capital for the Boss blind. Since I just scored 812 with a basic Pair and now have a Level 2 Two Pair, playing the blind makes more sense—I secure the $4, build interest, and still get a shop stop before facing the Boss.","action":"\"play_round\""}
