{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 12\n- Phase: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $11\n- Small Blind requires 11,000 chips\n- Big Blind requires 16,500 chips\n- Boss Blind requires 44,000 chips (Extra large blind)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored (suit changes at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult (adds sell value of all other jokers)\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit (synergizes with Ancient Joker!)\n\n**Skip Options:**\n- Skip Small: Get Meteor Tag (free Mega Celestial Pack)\n- Skip Big: Get Ethereal Tag (free Spectral Pack)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy recent hand scores show I was getting 4,000-7,000 chips per Two Pair in Ante 4. Now I'm in Ante 5 and need 11,000 for the Small Blind. Let me estimate my scoring potential:\n\nWith the new Smeared Joker + Ancient Joker combo:\n- Two Pair (Level 5): Base 100 chips, Base 6 mult\n- If I play 4 cards (2 pairs), and say 3 of them are Clubs/Spades (now both count as Clubs thanks to Smeared):\n  - Base chips: 100\n  - Card chips: Let's say 2 cards have odd ranks (Odd Todd +31 each) and 2 have even ranks (no chip bonus from Even Steven, just the base card value)\n  - ~10 chips per card = 40 chips from cards\n  - Odd Todd: 2 × 31 = 62 chips\n  - Total chips: 100 + 40 + 62 = 202 chips\n  \n  - Base mult: 6\n  - Swashbuckler: +11 mult\n  - Even Steven: 2 even cards × 4 = +8 mult\n  - Total additive mult: 6 + 11 + 8 = 25 mult\n  - Ancient Joker with 3 Clubs/Spades: 1.5^3 multiplier applies to the hand\n\n, giving 3.375x\n  - Final calculation: 202 chips × 25 × 3.375 = 17,043 chips\n\nThis should clear the Small Blind's 11,000 chip threshold. I'm weighing whether to skip and grab the Meteor Tag for additional planet cards to level up hands, or take the Ethereal Tag for Spectral Pack cards. Since my joker synergies are already solid and Two Pair just hit Level 5, I think I can push through the Small Blind without needing the extra boost.\n\nThe Meteor Tag would help me level up further, but with Smeared Joker now triggering Ancient Joker's multiplier on both Spades and Clubs, my scoring potential has jumped significantly. Looking back at my previous runs—I was getting 6,431 and 4,235 chips per Two Pair hand before adding Smeared Joker—I should now be hitting 15,000-20,000+ chips reliably. That's more than enough to beat this blind without skipping.\n\nI'll take the Small Blind and bank the $3 plus interest to have more capital for future purchases. Playing the round makes sense here.","action":"\"play_round\""}
