{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 5/8, Round 14\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Boss Blind: 44,000 chips needed\n- Money: $26\n- Boss Description: \"Extra large blind\" - This just means it has a very high chip requirement, which we can see (44,000).\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 mult per Spade (changes suit each round)\n3. Swashbuckler: +11 mult from sell values\n4. Even Steven: +4 mult per even card (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker: Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Two Pair - 5,762 chips (Big Blind, needed 16,500)\n- Flush - 11,109 chips (Big Blind)\n- Flush - 14,030 chips (Small Blind)\n- Two Pair - 6,431 chips (Ante 4, Boss)\n- Two Pair - 4,235 chips (Ante 4, Boss)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI need 44,000 chips for this boss blind. My highest scoring hands have been:\n- Flush: ~14,000 chips\n- Two Pair: ~6,400 chips\n\nTo reach 44,000 chips, I'd need approximately 3-4 hands of this caliber. However, I typically have 4 hands and 3 discards to work with in a round.\n\nThe challenge is significant. My current setup with Ancient Joker on Spades (which becomes Spades+Clubs with Smeared Joker) should help. Let me estimate what I can score:\n\n\nA strong Flush with 5 Spades or Clubs would give me a base of 50 chips and 6 mult at Level 2. With 3-4 odd cards triggering Odd Todd, I'd gain roughly 93-124 chips. Even Steven would add 4-8 mult from the remaining even cards. The Ancient Joker multiplies by X7.59 (1.5^5), and Swashbuckler contributes an additional +11 mult on top of that.\n\nTwo Pair plays differently—it starts at 120 chips with 7 mult at Level 6. The card values contribute around 30 chips, while Odd Todd on 5 odd cards generates 155 chips. Ancient Joker would only multiply by X2.25-3.375 with 2-3 Spades/Clubs in this hand. Even with Swashbuckler's +11 mult boost, the final score lands between 13,500-20,000 chips, significantly lower than the Flush variant.\n\nAcross 4 hands, I could potentially hit 2 strong Flushes for roughly 60,000 chips, or 3-4 Two Pairs for 52,000-80,000 chips. Both paths seem viable. Since Boss blinds are mandatory, I need to commit to this round. My available actions are limited—I can't use or sell consumables since I have none, but I could rearrange my Jokers to optimize their trigger sequence. The order matters because effects activate left-to-right: Odd Todd adds chips first, then Ancient Joker applies its multiplier, followed by Swashbuckler's mult bonus.\n\nLooking at how scoring actually works—Boss effects trigger first, then \"on played\" Jokers, then cards score with their modifiers and \"on scored\" Jokers, followed by \"on held\" Jokers and independent Jokers. Odd Todd and Even Steven both activate during card scoring, Ancient Joker triggers for matching suits, and Swashbuckler provides flat mult as an independent effect. The current arrangement doesn't need adjustment since the passive effects and timing work well as they are.","action":"\"play_round\""}
