{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small, need 300 chips\n- Current Chips: 120 (already scored from previous two pair)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $4\n- No jokers, no consumables\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n2: 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n3: King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4: 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n5: 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n6: 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n7: 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n8: 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Need to score:** 300 - 120 = 180 more chips\n\n**Analyzing Possible Hands:**\n\nPairs:\n- Three 2s (positions 2, 5, 6): 2 of Spades, 2 of Hearts, 2 of Clubs\n- Two 5s (positions 1, 4): 5 of Spades, 5 of Hearts\n\nThree of a Kind:\n- Three 2s: positions 2, 5, 6\n  - Base: 30 chips, 3x mult\n  - Cards: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 chips\n  - Total: 36 chips × 3 = 108 chips\n\nTwo Pair:\n- 2s and 5s: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (or 1, 2, 4, 6, or 1, 5, 4, 6)\n  - Base: 20 chips, 2x mult\n  - Using positions 2, 5, 1, 4 (2♠, 2♥, 5♠, 5♥): 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 = 14 chips, yielding 34 × 2 = 68 chips\n\nFull House:\n- Three 2s and Two 5s: positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6\n  - Base: 40 chips, 4x mult\n  - Cards: 5 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 16 chips, totaling 56 × 4 = 224 chips\n\nThe full house with three 2s and two 5s reaches 224 chips, which exceeds the 180 needed to clear the blind. = 16, giving 56 total chips with a 4x multiplier for 224 chips final. That gets me to 344 chips overall, which clears the 300 threshold. I'll play the Full House using positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
