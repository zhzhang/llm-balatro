{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips) - Odd rank, Spade (counts as Club with Smeared Joker)\n2. 9 of Spades (+9 chips) - Odd rank, Spade (counts as Club with Smeared Joker)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips) - Even rank, Spade (counts as Club with Smeared Joker)\n4. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips) - Even rank, Heart\n5. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips) - Even rank, Heart (pairs with 4 of Spades)\n6. King of Clubs (+10 chips) - Even rank, Club\n7. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips) - Even rank, Club\n8. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips + 30 extra chips) - Odd rank, Club, Bonus enhancement\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of 4s (4 of Spades, 4 of Hearts)\n- Flush: 5 Spades/Clubs (Ace, 9, 4 of Spades + King, Queen, 7 of Clubs) = 6 cards actually, so I can make a flush with 5 of them\n- Thanks to Smeared Joker, Spades and Clubs count as the same suit!\n\n**Joker Effects:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips per odd rank (A, 9, 7)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Club card (Spades count as Clubs now!)\n3. Swashbuckler: +11 Mult\n4. Even Steven: +4 Mult per even rank (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)\n5. Smeared Joker: Hearts/Diamonds same, Spades/Clubs same\n\n\nades: +4 chips, Even rank, Spade/Club (X1.5 from Ancient)\n- King of Clubs: +10 chips, Even rank, Club (X1.5 from Ancient)\n- 7 of Clubs: +7 chips + 30 bonus, Odd rank (+31 from Odd Todd), Club (X1.5 from Ancient)\n\nThe flush with these five cards triggers multiple multipliers. I get X1.5 from Ancient Joker for each of the five cards in the flush (all count as Clubs), plus +31 chips from Odd Todd for the three odd-ranked cards (Ace, 9, 7). The base chips total 41, and with the bonus on the 7, I'm looking at strong chip generation. The multiplier stack from Ancient Joker alone gives me X7.59 (1.5^5), and Swashbuckler adds another +11 Mult on top. + 93 = 214 chips total.\n\nFor multipliers, the base is 6, Swashbuckler adds 11, Even Steven contributes 8 from the two even cards, bringing the additive multipliers to 25. Ancient Joker multiplies by 1.5 for each of the five Clubs and Spades in the hand, resulting in 7.59375x. Multiplying everything together: 214 × 25 × 7.59375 = 40,625 chips, which comfortably exceeds the 11,000 blind requirement.\n\nThe optimal selection is positions 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8—the Ace of Spades, 9 of Spades, 4 of Spades, King of Clubs, and 7 of Clubs.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,6,8]"}
