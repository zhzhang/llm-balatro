{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase where I need to select one of three planet cards:\n\n1. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult, +30 chips)\n2. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush (+4 Mult, +40 chips)\n3. Pluto - Level up High Card (+1 Mult, +10 chips)\n\nLet me analyze what hands I've been playing and what would be most useful:\n\nFrom my last played hands:\n- Straight - 2,314 chips (most recent)\n- Pair - 812 chips\n- Straight - 2,403 chips\n- Two Pair - 360 chips\n- Pair - 232 chips\n- Two Pair - 292 chips\n- Full House - 224 chips\n\nI've played Straight twice and scored well with them (2,314 and 2,403 chips). I have Two Pair at Level 2 already, and Pair at Level 1.\n\nMy current joker setup:\n- Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n- Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card scored\n- Joker: +4 Mult\n\nThe next blind is the Boss Blind which debuffs all Diamond cards and requires 1,600 chips.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. Mars (Four of a Kind): I haven't played a Four of a Kind yet. Getting four matching cards is difficult and unlikely. This seems like a weak choice.\n\n2. Neptune (Straight Flush): I've played regular Straights successfully, but a Straight Flush requires 5 cards of the same suit in sequential rank, which is much harder to achieve. I haven't played any flushes or straight flushes yet. This seems risky.\n\n3. Pluto (High Card): High Card is the weakest hand type and I haven't played it. Upgrading it only gives +1 Mult and +10 chips. This is not very useful.\n\n\nNone of these upgrades directly benefit the hands I'm actually using—Straight, Two Pair, and Pair are already performing well. Four of a Kind is extremely difficult to assemble, Straight Flush is even more restrictive, and High Card provides minimal value. I'm essentially choosing between three suboptimal options, but Mars offers the best multiplier boost if I somehow manage to assemble four matching cards.\n\nThe real question is whether I should spend the $9 at all. I could preserve my funds for more impactful purchases later in the shop rather than investing in a hand type I'm unlikely to construct.\n\nBut since I've already committed $4 to this pack, abandoning it now feels wasteful. Neptune stands out as the strongest option here—if I somehow assemble a Straight Flush, the payoff would be significant given my current joker configuration. Mars offers decent value as a backup, though Four of a Kind remains difficult to trigger. Pluto is essentially dead weight.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
