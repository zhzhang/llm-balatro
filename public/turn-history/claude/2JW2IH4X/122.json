{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current Status\n- Ante 6/8, Round 15\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $24\n- Just sold Even Steven for $2\n\n## My Jokers (4/5 - one slot open)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Heart (changes suit at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +9 mult from other jokers' sell values (reduced from +11)\n4. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 mult and +10 chips - $3\n2. Lusty Joker - +3 mult per Heart played - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Spectral Pack - $4\n\nVoucher:\n1. Reroll Surplus - $10\n\nCurrent Reroll Cost: $6\n\n## Analysis\n\nI just sold Even Steven and now have $24 with one joker slot open. The plan from my previous reasoning was to buy Lusty Joker for $5, which would leave me with $19.\n\nLusty Joker synergizes perfectly with my strategy:\n- Ancient Joker gives X1.5 mult per Heart\n- Lusty Joker gives +3 mult per Heart\n- Smeared Joker makes Hearts=Diamonds, so both suits count as Hearts\n\nWith a 5-card Heart/Diamond flush:\n- Ancient Joker: X1.5^5 = X7.59375 multiplicative scaling\n- Lusty Joker: +15 mult (3 per card)\n- Plus base mult from Flush (8) and Swashbuckler (+9)\n\nThis is an excellent synergy that will help me reach the higher chip requirements in Ante 6 (which typically requires 20,000-30,000+ chips).\n\n\nBuying Lusty Joker is the right move here. It fills my last joker slot and creates a powerful multiplicative engine with Ancient Joker and Smeared Joker working together on Hearts and Diamonds.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
