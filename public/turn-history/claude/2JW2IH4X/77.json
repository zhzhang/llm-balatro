{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- Big Blind - need 7,500 chips\n- Current chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 4\n- Money: $8\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips) - ODD rank\n2. 9 of Spades (+9 chips) - ODD rank\n3. 7 of Spades (+7 chips) - ODD rank\n4. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips) - EVEN rank\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips) - ODD rank, CLUB suit\n6. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips) - ODD rank, CLUB suit\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips) - EVEN rank\n8. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips) - ODD rank\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club suit card scored\n3. Shortcut - Straights with gaps\n4. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult\n5. Blue Joker - +88 chips (currently 44 cards left in deck)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Two Pair: 9♠ 9♣ and 3♣ 3♦ - This is my strongest hand type (Level 4)\n- Pair of 9s: 9♠ 9♣\n- Pair of 3s: 3♣ 3♦\n\nLet me calculate the Two Pair option (9s and 3s):\n\n**Base hand:**\n- Two Pair Level 4: 80 chips, 5 mult\n\n\n- Blue Joker adds 88 chips on top\n\nFor the four cards in play, I'm scoring: both 9s contribute 9 chips each plus 31 from Odd Todd per card, both 3s contribute 3 chips each plus 31 from Odd Todd per card. The two clubs (9♣ and 3♣) also trigger Ancient Joker's multiplier effect.\n\nAdding it all up: 80 base + 88 from Blue Joker + 148 from the cards = 316 chips. For multiplier, I have 5 base plus 11 from Swashbuckler for 16, then Ancient Joker doubles the multiplier twice with the two clubs (×2.25 total). That gives me 16 × 2.25 = 36 multiplier, resulting in 316 × 36 = 11,376 points—well above the 7,500 target.\n\nI'll select the two pair: positions 2, 5, 6, and 8.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,5,6,8]"}
