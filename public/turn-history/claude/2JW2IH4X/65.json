{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 4/8, at Blind Select phase\n- Money: $13\n- Small Blind: 5000 chips needed, rewards $3\n- Big Blind: 7500 chips needed, rewards $4  \n- Boss Blind: 10000 chips needed, rewards $5, restriction: \"Play only 1 hand type this round\"\n\n**Skip Options:**\n- Skip Small Blind → Holographic Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic)\n- Skip Big Blind → Ethereal Tag (Gives a free Spectral Pack)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd ranks\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Heart suit (changes each round)\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Straights with gaps\n5. Swashbuckler - +10 Mult (from other jokers' sell values)\n\n**My Hand Performance:**\n- Two Pair is my most played hand (Level 3, 60 base chips, 4 base mult)\n- Last Two Pair scored 3,816 chips on Ante 3 Boss (which needed 4000)\n- I have strong joker synergy with my current setup\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Boss Blind requires playing only 1 hand type. This is actually favorable for me since Two Pair is my strongest and most consistent hand. The challenge is reaching 10,000 chips with just one hand type.\n\nLet me estimate my scoring potential with Two Pair:\n- Base: 60 chips, 4 mult (Level 3)\n- Cards played typically contribute ~40-60 chips\n- Total chips: ~100-120\n- Mult stack: 4 (base) + 4 (Joker) + 10 (Swashbuckler) = 18 base mult\n\n\n- Ancient Joker multiplies this further if I include Hearts, and Odd Todd contributes +31 per odd card in the hand\n\nIf I construct a Two Pair with Hearts and odd-ranked cards, I'm looking at roughly 162 chips × 40.5 mult for a single hand, which gives around 6,561 chips. Across 4 hands, this could potentially exceed the 10,000 chip threshold if I maintain consistent card selection and avoid dead hands.\n\nMy previous Ante 3 Boss run yielded 3,816 chips in a single hand, so Ante 4's Small Blind requirement of 5,000 chips seems achievable. The question becomes whether to skip Small Blind entirely for Holographic Tag—which grants a free Holographic joker worth +10 Mult—or proceed normally. Skipping costs me the $3 reward and the shop opportunity afterward, pushing me straight to Big Blind at 7,500 chips. The extra multiplier is appealing, but the monetary loss and reduced flexibility make it worth taking Small Blind first.","action":"\"play_round\""}
