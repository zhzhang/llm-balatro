{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 7\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Blind: Big Blind - Need 3000 chips, reward $4\n- Upcoming Boss Blind: -1 Hand Size, need 4000 chips, reward $5\n- Tag for skipping: Rare Tag (free Rare Joker in shop)\n- Current Money: $6\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd rank cards\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored (suit changes at end of round)\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Allows Straights with gaps\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Chariot - Enhances 1 card to Steel Card (X1.5 mult while in hand)\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Two Pair - 1,820 chips (Ante 3, Small Blind)\n- Two Pair - 1,666 chips (Ante 3, Small Blind)\n- Straight - 3,686 chips (Ante 2, Boss)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Big Blind requires 3000 chips. My recent Two Pair hands scored 1,820 and 1,666 chips on the Small Blind (which likely required less than 3000 chips). I was able to beat those, so my scoring is reasonable.\n\nMy Straight hands have been very strong (3,686 chips on a Boss blind in Ante 2), suggesting I can score well when I hit them.\n\nThe upcoming Boss Blind has -1 Hand Size, which will make it harder to form hands since I'll only have 7 cards in hand instead of 8.\n\n**Decision: Play or Skip?**\n\nOption 1: Play the Big Blind\n- Need 3000 chips\n- I've been consistently scoring in the 1,600-1,800 range with Two Pair on Small Blind\n\n\n- The Chariot could amplify my scoring with its X1.5 mult boost, and I'd earn $4 plus interest\n\nOption 2: Skip the Big Blind\n- Secure a Rare Tag for a free Rare Joker (typically worth $6-8)\n- Proceed directly to the Boss Blind with -1 Hand Size constraint\n- Forfeit the $4 reward\n\nThe Rare Joker from the tag represents substantial value, but skipping means I lose the $4 payout and face a more difficult Boss Blind with reduced hand capacity.\n\nThe -1 Hand Size severely limits my ability to construct strong hands like Two Pair or Straights with only 7 cards available. I still have The Chariot unused, which could provide a meaningful power spike before the Big Blind. Based on my recent performance scoring 1,600-1,800 on easier blinds, I believe I can reach the 3000 chip threshold if I deploy The Chariot strategically and play carefully. Playing the Big Blind seems like the better path forward.","action":"\"play_round\""}
