{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10 (in shop after completing Small Blind)\n- Money: $12\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently full)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd ranks (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club suit card scored\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Straights with gaps of 1 rank\n5. Swashbuckler - +10 Mult from other jokers' sell values\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Blue Joker - +104 chips (currently) - $5\n2. Jupiter Planet - Level up Flush (+2 Mult, +15 chips) - $3\n3. Jumbo Arcana Pack - $6\n4. Seed Money Voucher - $10\n5. Reroll - $5\n\n**Hand Levels after upgrade:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4, 80 chips, 5 mult (my most played - 9 times)\n- Pair: Level 2, 25 chips, 3 mult (played 4 times)\n- Straight: Level 1, 30 chips, 4 mult (played 4 times)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at Ante 4/8, so I need to prepare for increasingly difficult blinds. The Big Blind will likely require 7000-8000 chips, and the Boss Blind even more.\n\nCurrent options:\n1. **Blue Joker ($5)**: +104 chips is substantial. But I'm at max jokers, so I'd need to sell one first. Candidates:\n   - Basic Joker: Sells for $1, gives +4 Mult\n   - Shortcut: Sells for $3, enables gaps in straights. Selling it leaves me with $15, then $10 after buying Blue Joker. Selling the Basic Joker instead gives me $13, then $8 after the purchase.\n\n2. **Jupiter ($3)**: Would level up Flush, but I've never played Flush, so this doesn't align with my strategy.\n\n3. **Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6)**: Tarot cards could enhance my deck cards or provide useful effects.\n\n4. **Seed Money Voucher ($10)**: Raises interest cap to $10. With my current $12, I'd normally earn $2 interest, but this voucher would let me earn up to $10 if I save enough—a longer-term play.\n\n5. **Reroll ($5)**: Gives me $7 to search for better options.\n\nThe core issue is that I'm hitting harder blinds at Ante 4/8, my Two Pair is now Level 4 and performing well, and I need reliable chip generation. Blue Joker's flat +104 chips benefit every hand I play and compound with my other scoring mechanics.\n\nRunning the math: Two Pair at Level 4 gives 80 chips with 5 mult. Adding Blue Joker pushes that to 184 chips base, and with card values plus my other joker effects, I'm looking at 3000-4000+ chips per hand. The decision comes down to which joker to sacrifice. Basic Joker contributes about 23.5% of my total multiplier (roughly 47 chips of value at 200 base chips), which is less impactful than Blue Joker's direct +104. Shortcut enables straights with gaps, but I've only played 4 straights so far, suggesting it's not as central to my strategy.\n\nWait—I need to factor in Swashbuckler. It gains +1 Mult for every dollar of joker sell value. Right now my jokers total $10 in value. If I sell Basic Joker ($1), Swashbuckler drops to +9 Mult, costing me just 1 Mult. But selling Shortcut ($3) would tank Swashbuckler to +7 Mult, a loss of 3 Mult on top of losing the ability itself. Basic Joker is the safer choice since it minimizes the cascading penalty.\n\nSelling it costs 4 Mult from the joker plus 1 from Swashbuckler—5 total. At typical multipliers around 17x, that's roughly 1000 chips lost, but I'd gain 104 chips directly, which is a net positive. Blue Joker seems like the right upgrade to grab after. I'm also eyeing the Arcana pack since Tarot cards can enhance cards or modify jokers, giving me 5 options to pick from, though I'd only get limited uses out of it.\n\nWith $12 on hand and $2 interest coming in, I could skip purchases and hit the next shop with $14. But the Big Blind is coming up and I need to strengthen my deck now. Selling Basic Joker for $1 then buying Blue Joker for $5 leaves me at $8, giving me a solid chip boost without overextending.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
