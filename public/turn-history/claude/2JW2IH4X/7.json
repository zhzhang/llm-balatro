{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $2\n- Jokers: Odd Todd (gives +31 chips per odd-ranked card: A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n- Consumables: The Hierophant (enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards for +30 chips each)\n\n**Blind Select Decision:**\nI need to decide whether to:\n1. Play the Big Blind (450 chips needed, $4 reward)\n2. Skip the Big Blind (get Economy Tag that doubles money up to $40)\n\n**If I skip:**\n- I get Economy Tag which doubles my $2 to $4\n- I don't get the $4 reward from beating Big Blind\n- I proceed directly to Boss Blind (600 chips needed, discards 2 random cards per hand)\n- Boss blinds cannot be skipped\n\n**If I play:**\n- Need to beat 450 chips\n- Get $4 reward\n- Then can shop before Boss Blind\n- Boss Blind is 600 chips with the discard mechanic\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me think about my capability to beat the Big Blind:\n- I have Odd Todd which gives +31 chips per odd-ranked card\n- I have The Hierophant which can enhance 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n- If I enhance 2 odd-ranked cards with The Hierophant, they'll give +61 chips each when scored\n\nIn my previous Small Blind, I played:\n- Full House: 224 chips (needed 300)\n- Two Pair: 120 chips\n\nFor Big Blind (450 chips):\n- With Odd Todd, if I play a Full House with 3 odd-ranked cards (like A, A, A, 5, 5):\n  - Base: 40 chips\n  - Card values: 13 chips total\n  - Odd Todd bonus: 31×5 = 155 chips (all five cards are odd-ranked)\n  - Combined: 40 + 13 + 155 = 208 chips with 4x multiplier = 832 chips\n\nThis easily clears 450. If I apply The Hierophant to boost 2 of those cards to Bonus Cards first, the score would be substantially higher, making the Big Blind very achievable.\n\nWith Bonus Cards added, I'm looking at an additional 60 chips (30 per card × 2), bringing the total to 268 chips before multiplying by 4, which gives 1,072 chips. That's a comfortable win.\n\nFor the Economy Tag option, doubling my $2 to $4 doesn't compare favorably—I'd lose the $4 Big Blind reward, netting only $4 instead of $6 total. The math doesn't work in its favor.\n\nBeyond the immediate payout, there's a strategic advantage: playing the Big Blind lets me shop afterward before facing the Boss Blind, which requires beating 600 chips and discards 2 cards per hand. If I skip now, I'd go straight to that harder challenge without the opportunity to upgrade my deck. Given that I can comfortably win this round and gain both money and a shopping phase, playing is the better move.","action":"\"play_round\""}
