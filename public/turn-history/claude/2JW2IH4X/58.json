{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, in Shop phase after finishing Big Blind\n- Money: $5\n- About to face Boss Blind (Round 9)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 5, at capacity)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd ranks (A, 9, 7, 5, 3) - sells for $2\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Diamond suit - sells for $4\n3. Joker - +4 Mult - sells for $1\n4. Shortcut - Straights with gaps - sells for $3\n5. Swashbuckler - Adds sell value of other jokers to Mult (+10 Mult) - sells for $2\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Bootstraps: +2 Mult per $5 (currently +2 Mult since I have $5) - Cost: $7\n- Jumbo Buffoon Pack: Choose 1 of 4 jokers - Cost: $6\n- Telescope voucher: Celestial packs contain most played hand's planet - Cost: $10\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $5, which severely limits my options:\n- Can't afford Bootstraps ($7)\n- Can't afford Jumbo Buffoon Pack ($6)\n- Can't afford Telescope ($10)\n- Could reroll for $5, but that would leave me with $0\n\nThe only thing I could potentially do is sell a joker to get more money, then buy something. But let's think about whether that's worth it:\n\nIf I sell the basic Joker (+4 Mult) for $1, I'd have $6 total:\n- Swashbuckler would drop from +10 to +9 Mult (lose 1 Mult)\n\n\n- I'd lose the +4 Mult from the basic Joker\n- Net loss: -5 Mult\n- With $6, I could buy Jumbo Buffoon Pack\n\nTrading -5 Mult for a random joker isn't worth the risk right before a Boss Blind. If I sell Shortcut ($3) instead, I'd have $8 total, losing 3 Mult from Swashbuckler plus the Shortcut's utility, which is also a net negative.\n\nSince I can't make any beneficial purchases without weakening my hand, I should just proceed to the Boss Blind with what I have. My current jokers are already strong—Odd Todd providing substantial chip scaling, Ancient Joker multiplying based on Diamonds, and Shortcut enabling straights with gaps—so there's no reason to risk dismantling this setup.\n\nMy Two Pair hands are consistently hitting 1,600-1,820 chips, which should be enough to clear the 4,500-6,000 chip threshold at Ante 3 across multiple plays. Moving forward to round_select is the right call.","action":"\"round_select\""}
