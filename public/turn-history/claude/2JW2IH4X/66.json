{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10\n- Small Blind: Need 5000 chips\n- Money: $13\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips, odd rank)\n2. 6 of Spades (+6 chips, even rank)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips, even rank, Heart suit)\n4. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips, odd rank, Heart suit)\n5. King of Clubs (+10 chips, even rank)\n6. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips, even rank)\n7. 5 of Clubs (+5 chips, odd rank)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips, odd rank)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd ranks (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Heart suit card when scored\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Straights with gaps\n5. Swashbuckler - +10 Mult (from other jokers' sell values)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Two Kings (positions 3, 5) - a pair\n- Could look for a straight with Shortcut\n\nLet me calculate what I can score:\n\n**Option 1: Play Pair of Kings (positions 3, 5)**\n- Base: 25 chips (Level 2), 3 mult\n- King of Hearts: +10 chips, triggers Ancient Joker X1.5 Mult\n- King of Clubs: +10 chips\n- Total chips from cards: 25 + 10 + 10 = 45 chips\n- Base mult: 3\n\n\n- Joker: +4, Swashbuckler: +10, Total mult before Ancient Joker: 17, Ancient Joker: X1.5 (only one Heart card in the pair), Final mult: 17 × 1.5 = 25.5, Total: 45 × 25.5 = 1,147.5 chips\n\nThis falls short of the 5000 needed. I need to explore stronger combinations. Two Pair would give me a Level 3 hand with 60 base chips, which is more promising if I can discard strategically to build it.\n\nLooking at my cards (A, 6, K, 3, K, J, 5, 7), I have a pair of Kings already. I could keep those and draw new cards hoping for another pair. But I should also check if a straight is possible with Shortcut allowing gaps of 1. The sequence 7, 6, 5, 3 could work if I can fill in the gaps appropriately.\n\nSince straights seem unlikely to complete, my best move is to hold onto the Kings and discard the remaining cards to maximize my chances of hitting Two Pair or better.\n\nDiscard positions: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 (the Ace, 6, 3, 5, and 7). This keeps my pair of Kings and Jack while drawing five fresh cards that could pair with existing cards or create new combinations.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,7,8]"}
