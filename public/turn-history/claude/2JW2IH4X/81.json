{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $11\n- Next up: Boss Blind (requires playing only 1 hand type)\n- Boss blind will need 10,000 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Heart suit card scored\n3. Shortcut - Straights with gaps\n4. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult\n5. Blue Joker - +104 chips (52 cards in deck × 2)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Even Steven: +4 Mult per even rank (costs $4)\n- Madness: X0.5 Mult when blind selected, destroys random joker (costs $7) - BAD\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Seed Money voucher: $10\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult) - most played (10 times)\n- Full House: Level 2 (65 chips, 6 mult) - just leveled up\n- Other hands relatively low level\n\n**Strategy for Boss Blind:**\nThe boss requires playing only ONE hand type throughout the entire round. I need to decide what hand type to commit to.\n\nTwo Pair Analysis:\n- Base: 80 chips + 5 mult\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips = 184 chips\n- If I score 4 odd cards in two pair: +124 chips from Odd Todd = 308 chips\n- Card values from the two pairs: ~20-30 chips = ~330-340 chips\n- Base mult: 5 + 11 (Swashbuckler) = 16 mult\n\n\n- With 2 Hearts in hand: 16 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 36 mult\n- Total: ~330 × 36 = ~11,880 chips\n\nThis should be sufficient for the 10,000 chips needed!\n\nNow, should I buy anything from the shop? Even Steven costs $4 and adds +4 Mult per even rank. If I play a Two Pair with 4 even cards, that's +16 mult boost. But there's tension here since Odd Todd already incentivizes odd ranks, so I'd need to decide whether to build around evens or odds.\n\nMadness is clearly bad with X0.5 Mult and random joker destruction. Standard Pack doesn't help since I'm at 52 cards. Seed Money would cost $10, leaving me with just $1 that earns no interest. A Reroll for $5 could reveal better options and leave me with $6 to spend.\n\nThe key question is whether Even Steven's potential +16 mult justifies the $4 cost when my current strategy already leans heavily toward odd cards with Odd Todd. ,120 chips.\n\nComparing this to the odd card approach yields ~330 chips × 36 mult = ~11,880 chips, so the Even Steven strategy actually produces more. The multiplier gain outweighs losing the chip bonus from Odd Todd.\n\nThe real issue is consistency—I can't control which cards appear in my hand. To reliably build Two Pairs with even ranks, I'd need to check my deck composition. I have 22 even cards total (2s, 4s, 6s, 8s, 10s, Queens, Kings), which gives me decent odds of drawing enough even cards to make this work. play either strategy depending on what I draw. Since I'm slightly ahead on even cards but the distribution is close, having both Odd Todd and Even Steven would let me adapt to whatever comes next. I'll buy Even Steven for $4, leaving me with $7 for future shops.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
