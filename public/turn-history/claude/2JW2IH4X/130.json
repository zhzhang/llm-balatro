{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante 6/8, Round 16\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $22\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n## Current Jokers (5/5 - at capacity)\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Club (Spades count as Clubs with Smeared)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult from sell values\n4. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n5. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n## Upcoming Challenges\n- Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed (Hearts debuffed)\n\n## Shop Options\nCards:\n1. Misprint - +? (incomplete description) - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\n## Analysis\n\nI just bought Hanging Chad, which synergizes extremely well with my setup. Now I need to decide what to do next.\n\n**Options:**\n1. Buy Arcana Pack ($4) - Could get suit conversion or enhancement cards\n2. Buy Misprint ($4) - Unknown effect, risky\n3. Buy Reroll Surplus ($10) - Makes future rerolls $3 instead of $5\n4. Reroll shop ($5) - Look for better options\n5. Round select - Move to the next blind\n\n**Current Synergies:**\n- I have a strong setup with Hanging Chad + Ancient Joker + Odd Todd\n- If I play an odd-ranked Club/Spade first, it triggers 3 times:\n  - +31 chips × 3 = +93 chips\n  - X1.5 mult × 3 = X3.375 mult multiplier\n- This is very powerful for scaling\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I have $22 remaining\n- The Arcana Pack could provide useful enhancements or suit conversions\n- Suit conversions to Clubs/Spades would be very valuable given my Ancient Joker is on Clubs\n- Misprint is too risky with an incomplete description\n- Reroll Surplus doesn't help me right now since I'm about to play rounds\n\n**Best Move:**\nThe Arcana Pack for $4 seems like the strongest choice. A Tarot card offering suit conversions would amplify my existing synergies significantly, especially with the tripled multiplier from Hanging Chad. This is more valuable than the unknown Misprint or the Reroll Surplus, which won't impact my immediate performance. the best option. It could give me:\n- The Magician - Enhance 1 selected card to a Lucky Card\n- The Hanged Man - Destroy up to 2 selected cards\n- The Devil - Enhance 1 selected card to a Gold Card\n- Death - Convert 2 selected cards to a different random card\n- Temperance - Gives the total sell value of all current Jokers in hand\n- The Hermit - Doubles money (up to $20)\n- Strength - Increase rank of up to 2 selected cards by 1\n- The Chariot - Enhance 1 selected card to a Steel Card\n- Justice - Enhance 1 selected card to a Glass Card\n- The Wheel of Fortune - 1 in 4 chance to add editions to 1 Joker\n- The World - Converts up to 5 selected cards to a single random suit\n\nThe World stands out for creating flush opportunities, while Strength synergizes well with my Odd Todd strategy by adjusting card ranks. Enhancement cards provide additional scaling potential. Spending $4 on the Arcana Pack leaves me with $18, which supports both interest generation and flexibility for later purchases.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
