{"reasoning":"I'm in the PLANET_PACK selection phase. I need to choose one of three planet cards:\n\n1. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips) - Currently Level 1 (60 chips, 7 mult)\n2. Jupiter - Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips) - Currently Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n3. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult and +15 chips) - Currently Level 1 (10 chips, 2 mult)\n\nLooking at my hand usage:\n- Two Pair: Level 3, played 5 times (most played) - already upgraded\n- Straight: Level 1, played 3 times\n- Pair: Level 1, played 2 times\n- Full House: Level 1, played 1 time\n\nFrom my last played hands:\n- Two Pair has been my primary strategy with 3 of the last 7 plays\n- Straight has been strong when I can make it (3,686 chips, 2,314 chips, 2,403 chips)\n- Pair has been played 2 times (812 chips)\n\nNow analyzing the options:\n\n**Mars (Four of a Kind)**: I haven't played this hand type at all. It would go from Level 1 (60 chips, 7 mult) to Level 2 (90 chips, 10 mult). Not relevant to my current strategy.\n\n**Jupiter (Flush)**: I haven't played Flush at all (0 times). It's already Level 2, so this would make it Level 3. Not relevant to my current strategy.\n\n**Mercury (Pair)**: I've played Pair 2 times. It would go from Level 1 (10 chips, 2 mult) to Level 2 (25 chips, 3 mult). This is relevant since:\n- Pair is a fallback hand when I can't make Two Pair or Straight\n\n\n- The upgrade provides +1 Mult and +15 chips, a meaningful improvement to the base values\n\nI should clarify how the hand hierarchy works here. Two Pair is a distinct hand type with its own scoring—it doesn't inherit Pair's base values when played. So upgrading Pair wouldn't directly boost Two Pair's output, even though Two Pair technically contains a pair structurally.\n\nThat said, Mercury still makes sense as my choice. Pair serves as my backup when Two Pair isn't available, and I've already played it twice. The jump from 10 chips and 2 mult to 25 chips and 3 mult represents a substantial gain—150% more chips and 50% more mult. Mars and Jupiter don't apply since I haven't touched those hand types. Mercury upgrades something I actually rely on in my strategy.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
