{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the SHOP phase after winning the Small Blind\n- I have $17\n- I'm on Ante 3/8, Round 7\n- Ancient Joker has changed suit from Hearts to Clubs (as stated in its description)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - Now gives X1.5 Mult per Club card scored\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Allows Straights with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Earth - Level up Full House (+2 mult, +25 chips) for $3\n2. The Chariot - Enhances 1 card into Steel Card (X1.5 mult while in hand) for $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Celestial Pack - $4\n2. Celestial Pack - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for most played poker hand - $10\n\n**Hand Type Usage:**\n- Straight: Level 1, played 3 times\n- Two Pair: Level 2, played 5 times (most played)\n- Pair: Level 1, played 2 times\n- Full House: Level 1, played 1 time\n\n**Analysis:**\nTwo Pair is my most played hand (5 times). The Telescope voucher would guarantee that Celestial Packs contain the planet for Two Pair, but that costs $10 and I only have $17.\n\nLooking at my strategy:\n- I've been relying on Two Pair and Straights\n- Two Pair is already Level 2 (40 chips, 3 mult)\n- Straight is Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult)\n\n\n- My jokers work together well: Odd Todd triggers on odd cards, Ancient Joker multiplies Club cards, and Shortcut enables flexible straights\n\nWith my budget, I could pursue several paths: invest in Telescope to lock in Two Pair planets while buying one pack, grab two Celestial Packs for more card options, enhance a card with The Chariot for immediate mult boost, or reroll the shop to find better synergies. Since Two Pair is clearly my strongest hand, the Telescope investment seems promising if I can still afford additional packs. be significantly higher, so I need immediate strength. Buying a Celestial Pack gives me a solid chance at leveling Two Pair or another useful hand, which should help me survive the upcoming rounds. I'll go with purchasing one pack to boost my current setup.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
