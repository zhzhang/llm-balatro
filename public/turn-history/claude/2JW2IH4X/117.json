{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n## Current State\n- Ante 6/8, Round 15\n- In PLANET_PACK selection phase\n- Money: $30\n- Need to choose 1 planet card from 5 options\n\n## My Jokers\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd card (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 mult per Heart (currently)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 mult\n4. Even Steven - +4 mult per even card\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts=Diamonds, Spades=Clubs\n\n## Planet Card Options\n1. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips (currently Level 2: 140 chips, 12 mult)\n2. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips (currently Level 1: 5 chips, 1 mult)\n3. Earth - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips (currently Level 2: 65 chips, 6 mult)\n4. Saturn - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips (currently Level 1: 30 chips, 4 mult)\n5. Jupiter - Level up Flush +2 Mult and +15 chips (currently Level 2: 50 chips, 6 mult)\n\n## Analysis\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been heavily relying on Flush (played 5 times) and Two Pair (played 14 times). My most recent plays show Flush scoring between 11,000-15,000 chips in Ante 5.\n\nThe key synergy in my deck is:\n- Ancient Joker gives X1.5 mult per suited card (currently Hearts)\n- Smeared Joker makes Hearts=Diamonds, so all Hearts/Diamonds trigger Ancient Joker\n\n\n- A full 5-card Flush in the right suit multiplies to (1.5)^5 = 7.59x multiplier\n\nFlush is my primary scoring engine and currently at Level 2 with 50 chips and 6 mult. Since Ancient Joker rotates suits each round and Smeared Joker lets me combine two suits, I can consistently build strong Flush hands. With Ante 6 requiring significantly higher scores, upgrading Flush to Level 3 via Jupiter would add crucial scaling to my most reliable hand.\n\nThe alternatives don't compare—Neptune, Pluto, and Earth are played infrequently and lack consistency, while Saturn only appears 4 times and isn't central to my strategy. Jupiter's +15 chips and +2 mult directly strengthen my core engine, pushing Flush to 65 chips and 8 mult, which compounds effectively with Ancient Joker's multiplicative bonus.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
