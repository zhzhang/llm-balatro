{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $11\n- Next up: Boss Blind (requires playing only 1 hand type)\n- Boss blind will need 10,000 chips\n\n**Failed Action:**\nThe previous action tried to buy_card 1 (Even Steven) but it failed with \"Cannot buy card at position 1\"\n\nLooking at the shop, I see:\n- Shop Cards:\n  1: Even Steven - Joker card - $4\n  2: Madness - Joker card - $7\n\nWait, the error says \"Cannot buy card at position 1\". But I have $11 and Even Steven costs $4. Why would this fail?\n\nOh! I see the issue. I have 5 jokers already (Max Jokers: 5), so I can't buy another joker without selling one first!\n\nMy current jokers:\n1. Odd Todd - $2 sell value\n2. Ancient Joker - $4 sell value  \n3. Shortcut - $3 sell value\n4. Swashbuckler - $2 sell value (gives +11 Mult based on other jokers)\n5. Blue Joker - $2 sell value (gives +104 chips)\n\nTo buy Even Steven, I need to make room by selling a joker first.\n\nLet me think about which joker is least useful for the upcoming Boss Blind:\n\n**Boss Strategy:** Playing Two Pair repeatedly\n\n**Joker Analysis:**\n1. **Odd Todd** (+31 chips per odd rank scored) - Useful if I play odd cards in Two Pair\n2. **Ancient Joker** (X1.5 Mult per Heart card scored) - Very powerful multiplier if I can get Hearts\n3. **Shortcut** (Straights with gaps) - NOT useful for Two Pair strategy\n4. **Swashbuckler** (+11 Mult from other jokers' sell value) - Currently +11 Mult, good flat mult\n\n\n5. **Blue Joker** (+104 chips) - Large flat chip bonus\n\nFor Two Pair, Shortcut is completely dead weight since I won't be playing Straights. If I sell it for $3, Swashbuckler drops to +8 Mult. The remaining jokers all contribute meaningfully to my scoring through chips or multipliers, so Shortcut is the clear choice to remove.\n\nLet me compare the actual scoring outcomes. With my current setup keeping Shortcut, I'm looking at roughly 330 total chips multiplied by 36x (from base 5 mult plus 11 from Swashbuckler, then doubled twice by Hearts), giving me around 11,880 chips. But if I sell Shortcut to buy Even Steven instead, I'd have 4 even cards in my Two Pair, which drops my chip total to about 204 since I lose the odd card bonuses and Swashbuckler's mult decreases to 8.\n\nHowever, Even Steven adds 16 mult (4 cards × 4 each), bringing my total multiplier to 29 before the Hearts multipliers kick in. With the two Hearts doubling my mult twice, that becomes 65.25x, which actually scores around 13,650 chips—significantly better than my current path. The key insight is that Even Steven's mult scaling is strong enough to compensate for the lower chip count, and I'd gain flexibility to pivot toward either even or odd-focused hands depending on what I draw. I should sell Shortcut since it doesn't help Two Pair anyway and grab Even Steven for the adaptability and mult boost.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
