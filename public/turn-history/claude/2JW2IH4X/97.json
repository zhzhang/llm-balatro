{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 13\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $16\n- I just bought Temperance (now in my consumables)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Diamond card scored (suit changes at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult (adds sell value of all other jokers)\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. Temperance - Gives $13 (current joker sell value)\n\n**Shop Items:**\n- Basic Joker - +4 Mult for $2\n- Mega Arcana Pack - $8\n- Celestial Pack - $4\n- Seed Money Voucher - $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Interest Calculation:**\nWith $16, I'm earning $3 interest (at $5, $10, $15).\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 16,500 chips\n- Boss Blind: 44,000 chips (Extra large blind)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Use Temperance Now?**\n   - I have Temperance which gives me $13 (the total sell value of my jokers)\n   - If I use it now, I'll have $16 + $13 = $29\n   - With $29, I'd earn $5 interest (at $5, $10, $15, $20, $25)\n   - This is a significant boost\n\n2. **After Using Temperance ($29):**\n   - I could buy Seed Money for $10, leaving $19, earning $3 interest\n   - I could buy Celestial Pack for $4, leaving $25, earning $5 interest\n   - I could buy Mega Arcana Pack for $8, leaving $21, earning $4 interest\n   - I could just hold the cash and earn $5 interest\n\n3. **What do I need?**\n   - My last Flush scored 14,030 chips, which is good but not enough for the Big Blind (16,500) or Boss (44,000)\n   - Ancient Joker now works with Diamonds/Hearts thanks to Smeared Joker\n   - Two Pair is Level 5, Flush is Level 2\n\nThe key decision is whether to activate Temperance now for the cash boost and interest gains, or save it for later. Buying a pack could help me find better jokers to scale up my chip generation, but holding cash and earning interest might be safer given how far I need to go to beat these blinds. $29, I'd earn $5 interest, bringing me to $34 next shop, which opens up more purchasing possibilities.\n\nLooking at my scoring gap, I'm 2,470 points short of the Big Blind threshold with my current Flush setup. Upgrading Flush to Level 3 would boost both base chips and multiplier, potentially closing that gap. I'll activate Temperance to reach $29, then likely invest in the Celestial Pack to level up Flush rather than banking the cash.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
