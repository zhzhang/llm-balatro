{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1, just finished Small Blind\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $5\n- Jokers: Odd Todd (gives +31 chips per odd-ranked card: A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n- No consumables\n- Just beat Small Blind (300 chips)\n\n**What's Next:**\n- Big Blind: needs 450 chips\n- Boss Blind: needs 600 chips, and discards 2 random cards per hand played\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. The Hierophant (Tarot) - $3 - Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n2. Drunkard (Joker) - $4 - +1 discard each round\n3. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards to level up a hand\n4. Grabber (Voucher) - $10 - Permanently +1 hand per round (can't afford)\n5. Reroll - $5 - See new options\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith $5, I can afford:\n- The Hierophant ($3) and have $2 left\n- Drunkard ($4) and have $1 left\n- Celestial Pack ($4) and have $1 left\n- Reroll ($5) and have $0 left\n\n**Option 1: The Hierophant ($3)**\n- Enhances 2 cards to Bonus Cards (+30 chips each)\n- This permanently improves my deck\n- Bonus Cards give +30 chips when scored\n- Combined with Odd Todd, if I enhance odd-ranked cards, they'd give +31 from Odd Todd + +30 from Bonus = +61 chips each\n- This is a strong synergy\n- Would leave me $2 for interest earning\n\n\n- Drunkard could help against the Boss Blind's card discard mechanic, giving me an extra discard to manage the damage. Leveling up Full House through Celestial Pack would boost its base stats since it's currently at 40 chips and 4 mult. Rerolling uses all my money with no guarantee of finding something better.\n\nSaving the $5 for later rounds seems worth considering—I'd earn interest at the end of Big Blind and have more flexibility when facing the Boss Blind's punishing discard effect. The Big Blind should be manageable with Odd Todd providing 93 extra chips if I play a hand with three odd cards, but the Boss Blind at 600 chips with its two-card discard per hand is the real obstacle. I need to decide whether to strengthen my current jokers now or preserve capital for better options later.\n\nThe Hierophant catches my eye for $3—it permanently upgrades 2 cards to Bonus Cards worth +30 each, and if I enhance odd-ranked cards, they'd synergize with Odd Todd for +61 chips per card. That's a lasting deck improvement that compounds through future blinds. I'd still have $2 left for flexibility. But actually, I'm realizing The Hierophant needs to be activated during hand selection, not in the shop phase, so I can't use it right now even if I buy it.\n\nLooking at the available commands, buy_and_use_consumable won't work since The Hierophant requires selecting specific cards from my hand. I'd need to buy_card first, then activate it later during the next round when I have cards to select. So the strategy would be purchasing it now and applying it to my hand in the Big Blind round.\n\nComparing my options: The Hierophant costs less and pairs nicely with Odd Todd by boosting odd-ranked cards, while Drunkard and Celestial Pack both cost $4 and offer immediate effects. The Hierophant also leaves me with $2 for interest generation. I'll purchase it.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
