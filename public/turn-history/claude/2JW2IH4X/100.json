{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 13\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $25\n- Just upgraded Two Pair to Level 6 (120 chips, 7 mult)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Diamond card scored (suit changes at end of round)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult (adds sell value of all other jokers)\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 16,500 chips\n- Boss Blind: 44,000 chips (Extra large blind)\n\n**Last Scored Hand:**\n- Flush - 14,030.375 chips\n\n**Shop Items:**\n- Basic Joker - +4 Mult for $2\n- Mega Arcana Pack - $8\n- Seed Money Voucher - $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Interest:**\nWith $25, I'm earning $5 interest (at $5, $10, $15, $20, $25).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Scoring Gap:**\n   - My Flush scored 14,030 chips (need 16,500 for Big Blind - short by 2,470)\n   - Boss Blind needs 44,000 chips (short by ~30,000!)\n   \n2. **Two Pair is now Level 6** (120 chips, 7 mult base)\n   - This should improve my Two Pair scoring from the 4,235-7,031 range\n\n3. **Current Options:**\n   \n   **Option A: Buy Seed Money ($10)**\n   - Leaves $15 with $3 interest going forward\n   - Increases my interest cap to $10 instead of $5, which compounds over remaining rounds\n   - Doesn't directly boost this round's scoring though\n   \n   **Option B: Buy Mega Arcana Pack ($8)**\n   - Leaves $17 with $3 interest\n   - Two Tarot cards could modify my deck or jokers for better scoring\n   \n   **Option C: Buy Basic Joker ($2)**\n   - Leaves $23 with $4 interest\n   - Problem: I'm already at max jokers (5/5), so I'd need to sell something first\n   \n   **Option D: Reroll ($5)**\n   - Leaves $20 with $4 interest\n   - Might reveal better shop options\n   \n   **Option E: Skip shopping**\n   - Keep all $25 with $5 interest\n   - Preserve capital for later rounds\n   - Enter Big Blind with my current setup\n\nI'm still 2,470 chips short of the Big Blind requirement even with my best Flush (14,030 chips). The Boss Blind at 44,000 is even more daunting. The Mega Arcana Pack seems promising since Tarot cards could enhance my deck with multiplier or bonus effects, or strengthen existing jokers through Strength cards. At $8, it's a reasonable investment for potential scoring improvements.\n\nSeed Money doubles my interest cap from $5 to $10, but that only matters once I reach $50 in cash—I'm nowhere near that yet. The Basic Joker's +4 Mult isn't compelling either, especially since I'd need to sacrifice Swashbuckler (worth +11 Mult) just to fit it, resulting in a net loss. My best option is buying the Mega Arcana Pack for $8, leaving me with $17 and $3 interest, or simply finishing shopping to preserve my current $25.\n\nI'm leaning toward ending the shop phase now. The Two Pair upgrade to Level 6 should meaningfully improve my hand strength, and with $25 generating $5 interest, I'll have $30 by the next shop phase. The Mega Arcana Pack's randomness feels risky when I could bank resources for a more targeted purchase later. Time to move forward into the round.","action":"\"round_select\""}
