{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation:\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (need 1200 chips)\n- Current Money: $5\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n## My Hand:\n1. Jack of Spades - +10 chips (face card, even rank)\n2. 3 of Spades - +3 chips (odd rank)\n3. King of Hearts - +10 chips (face card, even rank)\n4. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips (face card, even rank)\n5. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips (odd rank)\n6. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips (odd rank)\n7. 7 of Clubs - +7 chips +30 extra chips (Bonus enhancement, odd rank)\n8. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips (even rank)\n\n## My Jokers:\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Club card scored (currently Clubs)\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n\n## Possible Hands in Current Hand:\n- Pair of 9s (positions 5 and 6) - both odd rank\n- Three of a kind? No, I only have two 9s\n- Straight? J-Q-K would need a 10, but I don't have one, and they're not all consecutive\n- Flush? I have 3 Clubs (6, 7, 9 of Clubs), 3 Hearts (K, Q, 9), 2 Spades (J, 3)\n- Two Pair? No, I only have one pair\n\n\n- The strongest option appears to be the Pair of 9s. Let me work through the scoring: both 9s are odd, so each triggers Odd Todd for +31 chips. The 9 of Clubs also activates Ancient Joker's multiplier effect. The base pair gives 10 chips and 2x multiplier, then I add the individual card values and joker bonuses. Ancient Joker = 9 mult\n6. Final score: 90 × 9 = 810 chips\n\nThat falls short of the 1200 target. Let me explore other hand possibilities. A Two Pair would require a second matching pair, but I only have the 9s. For a Flush, I'd need five cards of the same suit—I have at most three in any suit (Clubs: 6, 7, 9; Hearts: K, Q, 9; Spades: J, 3). A Straight is also impossible with my current ranks (3, 6, 7, 9, J, Q, K) since they don't form five consecutive values.\n\nI'm reconsidering whether discarding and drawing fresh cards might help. But I should also check if I've miscalculated the Pair scoring. The 7 of Clubs has a Bonus enhancement worth +30 chips, which is substantial. I need to think strategically about which hands maximize both Odd Todd and Ancient Joker bonuses—focusing on odd-ranked cards (3 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs) and Club cards (9 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs) to trigger these multipliers effectively.\n\nIf I play a Pair of 9s with the 7 of Clubs, 3 of Spades, and 6 of Clubs, only the paired 9s count toward the hand type itself. The unpaired cards won't activate the Odd Todd or Ancient Joker effects, so they contribute nothing beyond their base chip values. This confirms my earlier calculation of 810 chips for this configuration.\n\nI should discard and redraw to find a stronger hand. Face cards like Jacks, Kings, and Queens are even-ranked, so they don't benefit from Odd Todd's bonus. I'll prioritize keeping odd-ranked cards and Clubs. Discarding the Jack of Spades, King of Hearts, and Queen of Hearts (positions 1, 3, 4) gives me three new draws that might form a better combination. The 6 of Clubs is tempting to keep since it's a Club for Ancient Joker, but without being part of a strong hand, it's not worth holding onto.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,4]"}
