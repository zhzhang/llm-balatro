{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n## Current Situation:\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4 (just completed Small Blind)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n- Owned Jokers (3/5):\n  1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards\n  2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Club card scored (changes suit at end of round)\n  3. Joker: +4 Mult\n\n## Upcoming Blinds:\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed, $5 reward, \"All Diamond cards are debuffed\"\n\n## Shop Options:\nCards:\n1. Reserved Parking - $6 (face cards held in hand have 1/2 chance to give $1)\n2. The Star - $3 (converts up to 3 cards to Diamonds)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - $4 (choose 1 of 3 Playing cards)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Overstock - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n\nReroll: $5\n\n## What I just did:\nI bought a Celestial Pack and used Uranus to level up Two Pair from Level 1 to Level 2 (now 40 base chips, 3 base mult).\n\n## Analysis:\n\nWith only $5, my options are limited:\n- I can't buy Reserved Parking ($6)\n- I could buy The Star ($3) - but this is bad because the Boss Blind debuffs Diamond cards\n- I could buy Standard Pack ($4) - might get a good enhanced card\n- I could reroll ($5) - might get better options\n- I could just proceed to round_select\n\nLet me think about what I need:\n1. My jokers are decent but not amazing - Odd Todd and Ancient Joker are synergistic\n\n\n2. Two Pair is now Level 2, which should help me scale better\n3. I need to clear 1200 chips for Big Blind and 1600 for Boss Blind, but the Boss Blind debuffs Diamonds so I should focus on Clubs and other suits instead\n\nSince my last hand (Pair) scored 812 chips well above the Small Blind requirement, I'm in decent shape. The Standard Pack could give me an enhanced card that boosts my scoring further, leaving me with $1 after.\n\nAlternatively, I could skip the pack and save my $5 for the next shop. Winning Big Blind would give me $4, bringing my total to $9 and opening up better purchasing options. Given that I'm already performing well with my current setup, banking the money seems like the smarter play. on $9 gives me $1 interest, bringing me to $10 before the Boss shop. With that amount, I could afford the Overstock voucher or multiple items, which is more flexible than spending $4 now on a single card. Let me verify the interest calculation though—I earn $1 per $5 held at round's end, so $5 gives me $1 interest plus the $4 Big Blind reward equals $10 total before facing the Boss.\n\nIf I buy the Standard Pack instead, I'd have only $1 left, which generates no interest since it's below the $5 threshold. That leaves me with just $5 plus remaining hands, a $5 swing in value. The math clearly favors holding my cash and using **round_select** to skip this purchase and wait for better opportunities at the Boss shop.","action":"\"round_select\""}
