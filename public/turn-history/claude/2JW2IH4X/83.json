{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $14\n- Next up: Boss Blind (requires playing only 1 hand type) - need 10,000 chips\n- I just sold Shortcut joker for $3, bringing my money from $11 to $14\n\n**Current Jokers (4/5 slots):**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored (A, 9, 7, 5, 3) - sells for $2\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Heart card scored - sells for $4\n3. Swashbuckler - +8 Mult (from sell values of other jokers: 2+4+2 = 8) - sells for $2\n4. Blue Joker - +104 chips (52 cards × 2) - sells for $2\n\n**Shop:**\n- Even Steven: +4 Mult per even rank (10, 8, 6, 4, 2) - $4\n- Madness: X0.5 Mult when blind selected, destroys random joker - $7 (BAD)\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Seed Money voucher: $10\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe plan was to buy Even Steven to give me flexibility in playing either even or odd-focused Two Pairs depending on what I draw. I now have 4 joker slots filled (out of 5 max), and $14 in cash.\n\nShould I buy Even Steven for $4?\n\nLet me recalculate the scoring potential with Even Steven:\n\n**With Even Steven (playing 4 even cards in Two Pair):**\n- Base chips: 80\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Card values: ~20 chips (4 even cards)\n\n\n- Total chips: ~204\n- Base mult: 5\n- Swashbuckler: +8 mult\n- Even Steven: +16 mult (4 even cards × 4)\n- If 2 Hearts: multiplier reaches ~65.25\n- Final score: ~13,311 chips\n\n**Without Even Steven (playing 4 odd cards in Two Pair):**\n- Base chips: 80\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Odd Todd: +124 chips from odd ranks\n\n, bringing total chips to ~328\n- Base mult: 5\n- Swashbuckler: +8 mult = 13 mult\n- If 2 Hearts: 13 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 29.25 mult\n- Final score: ~328 × 29.25 = ~9,594 chips\n\nThe even Steven route clears the 10,000 threshold comfortably at ~13,311, whereas the odd path falls short at ~9,594. Even Steven seems like the safer choice. I've got $14 available and Even Steven costs $4, leaving $10 to work with. I should think about what else I could purchase with the remaining budget.\n\nRerolling for $5 might reveal better options, but I'm facing the Boss Blind soon and need reliability over exploration. Seed Money would boost my interest cap from $5 to $10 for long-term economy, but that's less critical right now than securing this round. Even Steven at $4 is the pragmatic play. Adding cards via Standard Pack would dilute my deck further since I'm already at 52 cards, so that's not worth it either.\n\nMadness is clearly a trap with its X0.5 multiplier and joker destruction. Even Steven gives me the flexibility and scoring boost I need to consistently break past 10,000 points.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
