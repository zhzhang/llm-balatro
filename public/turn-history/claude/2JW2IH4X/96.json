{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 13\n- Phase: SHOP\n- Money: $19\n- Just completed Small Blind with a Flush that scored 14,030 chips\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Diamond card scored (suit CHANGED from Clubs to Diamonds!)\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit\n\n**Key Observation:** Ancient Joker's suit changed from Clubs to Diamonds at the end of the round! Now it triggers on Diamonds, and with Smeared Joker, Hearts also count as Diamonds.\n\n**Shop Items:**\n- Temperance (Tarot) - Gives $13 (current joker sell value) for $3 - Net gain of $10\n- Basic Joker - +4 Mult for $2\n- Mega Arcana Pack - $8\n- Celestial Pack - $4\n- Seed Money Voucher - $10\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Interest Consideration:** With $19, I'm earning $3 interest (at $5, $10, $15). If I spend nothing, I'll have $22 next round.\n\n2. **Upcoming Blinds:**\n   - Big Blind: 16,500 chips\n   - Boss Blind: 44,000 chips (Extra large blind)\n\n3. **Current Scoring Potential:**\n   I just scored 14,030 chips with a Flush. My joker synergies are:\n   - Ancient Joker now works with Diamonds/Hearts (thanks to Smeared)\n   - Two Pair at Level 5 is still my most played hand\n   - Flush at Level 2 also proved quite effective this round\n\n4. **Shop Options Evaluation:**\n\n   **Temperance:** Costs $3, gives $13, net gain of $10. This would bring me to $29. This is essentially free money and would boost my interest generation significantly.\n\n   **Basic Joker:** +4 Mult for $2. Not particularly strong, and I'm at max jokers (5/5). Would need to sell something.\n\n   **Celestial Pack:** $4 for a planet card to level up hands. Two Pair is already Level 5, Flush is Level 2. Leveling Flush could be good since it's been performing well and would scale better with my current setup.\n\n   **Seed Money Voucher:** $10 to raise interest cap to $10. With $19, this doesn't help immediately, but if I grab Temperance first, I'd have $29, then buy this for $19 left, earning $3 interest still. Next round I'd have $22+reward, potentially hitting the higher interest cap.\n\n   **Mega Arcana Pack:** $8 for 2 tarot cards. Could be useful for enhancements or transformations.\n\n5. **Best Strategy:**\n\n   Temperance is basically free money (+$10 net), so I should definitely buy it. After that I'll have $29, which opens up options like the Seed Money Voucher for $10 (leaving $19 with $3 interest) or the Celestial Pack for $4 to strengthen my Flush hand further.\n\n   Looking ahead at the 16,500 and 44,000 blinds, I need solid scoring potential. My Ancient Joker setup on Diamonds and Hearts through Smeared should handle this if I draw the right suits. After buying Temperance, I'll decide whether to invest in Seed Money for long-term interest growth or grab the Celestial Pack for immediate hand improvements, or just hold the cash for now.\n\n   Temperance is essential for the free $10. Beyond that, I'm torn—Seed Money would help future rounds but won't hit the higher interest cap yet with only $19 remaining. Since I'm at Ante 5/8 and need consistent scoring against these escalating blinds, I should prioritize immediate strength over long-term money generation. I'll grab Temperance and bank the rest for the next shop, where I might find upgrades that directly boost my scoring potential.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
