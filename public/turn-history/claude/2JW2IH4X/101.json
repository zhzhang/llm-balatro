{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round 13\n- Phase: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $25\n- Blind: Big Blind requiring 16,500 chips\n- Skip reward: Ethereal Tag (free Spectral Pack)\n- Next: Boss Blind requiring 44,000 chips (Extra large blind)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips per odd rank scored\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Diamond card scored\n3. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult\n4. Even Steven - +4 Mult per even rank scored\n5. Smeared Joker - Hearts/Diamonds same suit, Spades/Clubs same suit\n\n**Key Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 6 (120 chips, 7 mult) - Just upgraded, most played (12 times)\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) - Last scored 14,030 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy last Flush scored 14,030 chips, but the Big Blind needs 16,500 chips - I'm 2,470 chips short. However, I just upgraded Two Pair to Level 6, which should improve my scoring significantly.\n\nLet me estimate if I can beat the Big Blind:\n\nFor a Two Pair with good cards:\n- Base: 120 chips, 7 mult\n- If I play something like two 9s and two 5s (all odd):\n  - Base 120 chips\n  - 4 cards × 31 chips (Odd Todd) = 124 chips\n  - Total chips = 244\n  - Base mult = 7\n  - Even Steven adds nothing (no even cards)\n  - 4 cards × 4 mult (Even Steven wouldn't apply)\n  - Swashbuckler adds +11 mult = 18 mult\n  - If they're all Diamonds/Hearts: 4 × X1.5 = X5.0625 mult\n  - Total: 244 × 18 × 5.0625 ≈ 22,248 chips\n\nWith all four cards as Diamonds, the Ancient Joker multiplies to X5.0625 total, giving me roughly 22,248 chips—well above the 16,500 needed.\n\nThe Boss Blind at 44,000 chips is nearly double that threshold, which presents a real challenge. I'm weighing whether to attempt the Big Blind for the $4 reward and face the Boss afterward, or skip it entirely for the Ethereal Tag instead.\n\nThe Ethereal Tag grants a Spectral Pack with cards that can fundamentally reshape my strategy—adding negative joker copies, enhancing ranks, converting cards to money, or applying seals. But taking this path means jumping straight to the Boss Blind without another shop visit to refine my setup. Playing the Big Blind gives me the $4 reward (bringing me to $34 with interest), another shop opportunity to strengthen my hand before facing the Boss, and a chance to test whether my current calculations hold up in practice.","action":"\"play_round\""}
