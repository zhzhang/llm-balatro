{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10 (just completed)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $18\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently full with 5 jokers)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd ranks\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club suit card (suit changed from Hearts to Clubs at end of round)\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Straights with gaps\n5. Swashbuckler - +10 Mult from other jokers' sell values\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Blue Joker - +104 chips (currently) - $5\n2. Jupiter Planet - Level up Flush (+2 Mult, +15 chips) - $3\n3. Jumbo Celestial Pack - $6\n4. Jumbo Arcana Pack - $6\n5. Seed Money Voucher - Raise interest cap to $10 - $10\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at Ante 4/8, so I need to keep progressing through the game. Looking at my hand levels, I've been playing Two Pair most frequently (9 times, Level 3), followed by Pair (4 times, Level 2) and Straight (4 times, Level 1).\n\nMy current joker setup is decent but not amazing:\n- Odd Todd gives good chips when I play odd cards\n- Ancient Joker now works with Clubs (changed from Hearts)\n- Basic Joker gives +4 Mult\n- Shortcut helps with Straights\n- Swashbuckler gives +10 Mult\n\nLooking at my options:\n\n1. **Blue Joker ($5)**: Currently gives +104 chips. My deck has 52 cards, so it would give +2 per card. \n\nBlue Joker would be a solid chips boost for any hand I play, but I'm already at max jokers so I'd need to sell something first. \n\n2. **Jupiter ($3)**: Would level up Flush to Level 3. I've only played Flush 0 times, so this doesn't align with my current strategy.\n\n3. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)**: Could unlock planets to level up hands I actually use like Two Pair, Pair, or Straight.\n\n4. **Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6)**: Tarot cards can enhance my deck cards or jokers, which could be very valuable.\n\n5. **Seed Money Voucher ($10)**: Raises interest cap to $10, which would help with long-term economy.\n\nI need to focus on what matters most at Ante 4/8 - strengthening my most-played hands like Two Pair and Pair, while building chip generation. The Blue Joker's +104 chips is tempting, but I'd have to sell a joker first. Odd Todd only sells for $2, so that's not ideal. The Jumbo packs seem more efficient for improving my actual strategy without sacrificing existing resources. d level up Two Pair or Pair, leaving me with $12. I could also reroll for $5 to search for better options.\n\nLooking at the math: Blue Joker's +104 chips is substantial, but replacing the basic Joker means losing 4 Mult—which typically costs around 68-108 chips depending on my hand multipliers. The chip gain roughly offsets this loss. Shortcut has been less impactful, only enabling 4 straights so far, making it a more expendable card.\n\nThe Jumbo Celestial Pack seems like the stronger play though. Leveling up Two Pair or Pair would permanently boost my scoring, which compounds over the remaining rounds. I'll grab it for $6.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
