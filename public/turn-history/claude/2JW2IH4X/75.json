{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 10 (in shop after completing Small Blind)\n- Money: $8\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently full with 5 jokers)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd ranks (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club suit card scored\n3. Shortcut - Straights with gaps of 1 rank\n4. Swashbuckler - +11 Mult from other jokers' sell values\n5. Blue Joker - +104 chips\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Jupiter Planet - Level up Flush (+2 Mult, +15 chips) - $3\n2. Jumbo Arcana Pack - $6\n3. Seed Money Voucher - $10\n4. Reroll - $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4, 80 chips, 5 mult (most played - 9 times)\n- Pair: Level 2, 25 chips, 3 mult (played 4 times)\n- Straight: Level 1, 30 chips, 4 mult (played 4 times)\n\nI've successfully bought Blue Joker, which gives me +104 chips. Now I have $8 left.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n1. **Jupiter ($3)**: Would level up Flush to Level 3. But I've never played Flush (0 times), so this doesn't align with my strategy. This is not worth it.\n\n2. **Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6)**: This gives me 5 Tarot card options to choose from and use immediately. Tarot cards can:\n   - Enhance playing cards (add bonus chips, mult, etc.)\n   - Modify suits or ranks\n   - Potentially buff jokers\n   This could be valuable, but costs $6, leaving me with $2.\n\n3. **Seed Money Voucher ($10)**: I only have $8, so I can't afford this.\n\n4. **Reroll ($5)**: Costs $5, leaving me with $3. I could potentially find better options, but the current shop isn't terrible.\n\n5. **round_select**: Move on to the next blind with $8.\n\nI'm at Ante 4, about to face the Big Blind (likely requiring significant scoring). The Jumbo Arcana Pack could help me enhance my most-played hands or modify cards to better synergize with my jokers. However, I need to weigh whether spending $6 now is worth the potential gains versus saving money for future rounds. my cards with various effects. The Hanged Man could sacrifice a card for cash, The Devil might convert cards to Gold cards, and The Chariot could add Steel to a card—but I'm gambling on which ones actually appear.\n\nIf I hold the $8 instead, I'll enter the Big Blind and likely accumulate $9-11 by the next shop after earning hand bonuses and interest. My current jokers—Blue Joker providing +104 chips, Odd Todd giving +31 per odd card, and Ancient Joker—should handle the Big Blind's difficulty at this ante level.\n\nLooking at my actual scoring potential with a Two Pair: base 80 chips and 5 mult, plus Blue Joker's +104 gets me to 184 chips. Adding two odd cards pushes that to 246, and card values might add another 20-40 for roughly 280 chips. My mult sits at 16 from the base and Swashbuckler, scaling to 36 if I hit two clubs. That gives me around 10,080 chips—more than enough to clear the Big Blind without needing the Arcana Pack.\n\nThe Arcana Pack tempts me with enhanced cards and joker upgrades, but at $6 it leaves me with only $2, eliminating interest generation and any safety margin for future shops. Since I can't predict what cards I'd actually get, the risk isn't worth it. My current joker setup is strong enough to advance, so I'm keeping my $8 intact and moving forward.","action":"\"round_select\""}
