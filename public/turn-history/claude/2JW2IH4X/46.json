{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the SHOP phase after using the planet card\n- I have $13\n- I'm on Ante 3/8, Round 7\n- I just upgraded Two Pair to Level 3 (60 chips, 4 mult)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd - +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult per Club card scored\n3. Joker - +4 Mult\n4. Shortcut - Allows Straights with gaps of 1 rank\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Earth - Level up Full House (+2 Mult and +25 chips) for $3\n2. The Chariot - Enhances 1 card into Steel Card (X1.5 mult while in hand) for $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Celestial Pack - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain the Planet card for most played poker hand - $10\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $13 left. Let me think about what's most valuable:\n\n1. **Telescope ($10)**: This would guarantee that future Celestial Packs contain Two Pair planets (my most played hand). But it costs $10, leaving me with only $3. This is a long-term investment.\n\n2. **Celestial Pack ($4)**: Another random planet card. Could be useful but not guaranteed to help.\n\n3. **Earth ($3)**: Levels up Full House, which I've only played once. Not my main strategy.\n\n4. **The Chariot ($3)**: Enhances a card into Steel Card, which gives X1.5 mult while in hand. This could be very powerful for my strategy.\n\n5. **Reroll ($5)**: Could find better jokers or cards.\n\n\n---\n\nTwo Pair has been my most consistent hand at 5 plays, now Level 3. The Telescope creates an interesting trade-off: spending $10 locks me into $3 remaining, which means I couldn't afford another Celestial Pack to actually use the benefit. Alternatively, I could buy two more Celestial Packs for $8 and hope for useful planets without the guarantee.\n\nThe Chariot intrigues me more—converting a card to Steel gives X1.5 mult passively while it stays in hand. If I enhance something I rarely play, I'd get consistent multiplicative scaling on top of my existing sources. With the Big Blind approaching and ante requirements climbing, I need to weigh immediate power against future flexibility.\n\nTelescope locks in Two Pair scaling for the whole run, but at $10 it leaves only $3—not enough for another Celestial Pack, so the synergy doesn't activate until next shop. Better to grab another Celestial Pack now for $4, leaving $9 to reassess based on what planets drop.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
