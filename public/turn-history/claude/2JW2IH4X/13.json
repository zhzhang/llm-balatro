Ace of Clubs (+11 chips, +30 Bonus enhancement) - ODD\\n2. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips, +30 Bonus enhancement) - ODD  \\n3. Queen of Spades (+10 chips) - EVEN\\n4. 6 of Spades (+6 chips) - EVEN\\n5. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips) - EVEN\\n6. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips) - EVEN\\n7. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips) - EVEN\\n8. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips) - ODD\\n\\n**Odd cards:** Ace of Clubs (1), 7 of Clubs (2), 3 of Diamonds (8)\\n**Even cards:** Queen (3), 6 of Spades (4), 6 of Hearts (5), 2 (6), Jack (7)\\n\\n**Current Situation:**\\n- Need 450 chips\\n- Have 4 hands remaining, 3 discards remaining\\n- Current chips: 0\\n- Joker: Odd Todd (+31 chips per odd-ranked card when scored)\\n\\n**Possible Hands:**\\n1. Pair of 6s (positions 4, 5)\\n2. High Card with odd cards\\n\\nLet me calculate the scoring for different options:\\n\\n**Option 1: Play Pair of 6s + 3 odd cards (Ace, 7, 3)**\\nHand type: Pair\\n- Base hand chips: 10\\n- Base mult: 2\\n- Cards that participate in the pair: 6 of Spades and 6 of Hearts\\n- Card chips from the pair: 6 + 6 = 12\\n- Odd Todd bonus: The pair consists of even cards, so no bonus from Odd Todd for the pair itself\\n- Total chips: 10 + 12 = 22\\n\\n\\n- Total mult: 2\\n- Final chips: 22 \\u00d7 2 = 44 chips\\n\\nThis is far too low. I need to reconsider my approach. In a pair, only the cards forming the pair contribute their chip values, and Odd Todd only triggers on odd-ranked cards that are actually scored. Since the 6s are even, they won't activate the joker bonus.\\n\\n**Option 2: Play all 3 odd cards (Ace, 7, 3) as a High Card instead** would let me leverage Odd Todd's +31 chips per odd card, giving me 93 chips from the joker alone plus the base card values.\\n\\nBut I'm still getting suboptimal results. The real constraint is that only scored cards trigger Odd Todd, and I need to figure out which hand type maximizes the number of odd cards that actually get scored. A pair only scores two cards, while a high card scores just one. I should explore whether there's a way to score more odd cards simultaneously. cards to play. If I select positions 4 and 5 (the pair of 6s), only those two contribute chips\\u2014the other cards I pick don't add value unless they're part of the actual hand. So if I play the Ace, 7, and 3 alongside the pair, they won't score because they're not participating in the pair itself.\\n\\nMy realistic options are to either play the pair now and accept the modest payout, or discard some cards hoping to improve. Discarding the Queen, Jack, and 2 would let me keep the odd-ranked cards and 6s while drawing fresh cards. I need to figure out whether the expected value of a better hand justifies the risk of discarding.\\n\\nA two pair would be significantly stronger\\u201420 base chips with 2x multiplier, plus the card values from both pairs. If I could pair my 7s with the Bonus 7 I have, that would trigger Odd Todd for additional chips per odd card. Let me work through the math: two pair gives 20 base, the 6s contribute 12 chips, and if the 7s are paired with my Bonus 7, each 7 would be worth around 37 chips with the bonus factored in, giving me roughly 106 total chips before Odd Todd multiplies the odd cards further.\\n\\nEven accounting for Odd Todd's bonus on the 7s, I'm looking at around 168 chips with a 2x multiplier, which only gets me to 336\\u2014still short of 450. I need to consider other hand types like a flush or straight, or possibly three of a kind. Actually, the simplest move is to discard strategically and redraw. I'll hold onto my enhanced odd cards and the pair of 6s, letting go of the Queen, 2, and Jack to find better cards. Though I should reconsider\\u2014the 3 is odd too, so keeping it would help with Odd Todd's payout.\\nCommand: discard 3 6 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 12]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.

Pair of 6s\\n\\nLet me calculate the best option:\\n\\n**Option 1: Play Three of a Kind with the three 6s**\\nHand type: Three of a Kind\\n- Base hand chips: 30\\n- Base mult: 3\\n\\n\\n- Cards that participate: 6 of Spades, 6 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs\\n- Card chips from the three 6s: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18\\n- Odd Todd bonus: The 6s are even, so no bonus from Odd Todd\\n- Total chips: 30 + 18 = 48\\n- Total mult: 3\\n- Final chips: 48 \\u00d7 3 = 144 chips\\n\\nThis falls well short of 450 chips needed.\\n\\n**Option 2: Explore odd card combinations**\\n\\nI have four odd-ranked cards available: Ace, 7, 5, and 3. Each would trigger Odd Todd's +31 chip bonus, which could significantly boost the total. Let me see if I can construct a stronger hand using these cards instead of the three 6s.\\n\\nThe Ace, 7, 5, 3 don't form a straight or flush since they're different suits and non-consecutive ranks. Playing them as a High Card would give me a base of 5 chips plus the four Odd Todd bonuses (4 \\u00d7 31 = 124 chips), totaling 129 chips before any multipliers. This is still weaker than the three-of-a-kind approach, but I should explore whether combining some odd cards with other cards might create a better outcome. cards that participate in the hand type get scored. So if I play Three of a Kind (three 6s) + Ace + 7, only the three 6s would be scored, and the Ace and 7 wouldn't contribute.\\n\\nLooking at my current hand, I have three 6s (even) and Ace, 7, 5, 3 (all odd but no pairs). I can't form a Full House combining the 6s with odd cards since there are no matching pairs among them. Drawing better cards might be necessary to find a hand that actually leverages the odd cards effectively. scored cards (only the three 6s): 6 + 6 + 6 = 18. The Ace and 7 wouldn't add anything even if included in the play. I'm considering a different approach\\u2014discarding the even cards to focus on pairing or tripling the odd cards instead. The King and one 6 could go, leaving room to draw another Ace, 7, 5, or 3. Looking at what's left in the deck, there are still 3 of each of those ranks available.\\n\\nWith 2 discards and 4 hands remaining, I need 450 total chips. Playing the three 6s now gives 144 chips, leaving 306 needed across 3 hands\\u2014about 102 per hand. But I should also consider that my enhanced Ace and 7 each have +30 bonus chips, so if I can pair either of them, those bonuses multiply significantly.\\n\\nA pair of Aces would score (10 + 82 + 62) \\u00d7 2 = 308 chips just from that one hand, which would make reaching 450 much easier with the remaining hands. My best move is to discard strategically to chase another Ace or 7, keeping the pair of 6s as a backup. I'm torn between discarding the King and one 6, or reconsidering since I actually have three 6s that could work as a solid Three of a Kind play. 4 and 6).\\n\\nThe King doesn't help with Odd Todd's synergy, and the 6 of Clubs is redundant since I already have two other 6s. Discarding these two gives me the best chance at drawing an Ace or 7 while preserving my odd cards that work with the deck's mechanics.\\nCommand: discard 4 6\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 13]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Odd Todd.
