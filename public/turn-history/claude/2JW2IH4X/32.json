{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 5 (in SHOP phase)\n- Money: $9\n- Next up: Boss Blind requiring 1,600 chips (Boss debuffs all Diamond cards)\n- I just bought a Celestial Pack and used Neptune to upgrade Straight Flush to Level 2 (140 chips, 12 mult)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Odd Todd: +31 chips for odd rank cards (A, 9, 7, 5, 3)\n2. Ancient Joker: X1.5 Mult per Spade card scored\n3. Joker: +4 Mult\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- To Do List: $4 - Earn $4 if poker hand is Full House\n- Greedy Joker: $5 - Diamond cards give +3 Mult (but Boss debuffs Diamonds!)\n- Buffoon Pack: $4 - Choose 1 of 2 Joker cards\n- Overstock Voucher: $10 - +1 card slot in shop\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Greedy Joker** - This would be BAD for the Boss Blind since the Boss debuffs all Diamond cards. Not worth $5.\n\n2. **To Do List** - For $4, I get $4 back if I play a Full House. I've only played 1 Full House so far. This isn't reliable income and Full Houses are hard to form consistently. Not worth it.\n\n3. **Buffoon Pack** - For $4, I get to choose 1 of 2 random Jokers. This could be good if I get a strong joker. With my current setup scoring well (2,314 chips on a Straight), adding another joker could help me scale further into later Antes. This seems like the best use of my $9.\n   \nOverstock is out of reach at $10, and rerolling for $5 would leave me with only $4 afterward, which severely limits what I can actually purchase. The Buffoon Pack is the clear winner—spending $4 gives me a solid chance at a synergistic fourth joker while keeping $5 in reserve for future rounds.\n\nMy current setup (Odd Todd, Ancient Joker, and a basic Joker) is already performing well, and I'm well above the Boss Blind threshold with my 2,314-chip score versus the 1,600 needed. Since I'm not in immediate danger, I should weigh whether investing now or banking resources for later rounds makes more sense.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack seems like the strongest play here—spending $4 to add a fourth joker gives me better scaling potential going forward, even if the specific joker options aren't exceptional. I'll go with that.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
