{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the current booster pack choices and decide which planet card to select. Let me look at my hand usage patterns:\n\nFrom the hand levels and last played hands:\n- Two Pair: Level 3, played 9 times (most frequent)\n- Pair: Level 2, played 4 times \n- Straight: Level 1, played 4 times\n- Full House: Level 1, played 1 time\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, played 1 time\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1, played 0 times\n\nThe booster pack options are:\n1. Uranus - Level up Two Pair (Level 3→4): +1 Mult and +20 chips\n2. Mercury - Level up Pair (Level 2→3): +1 Mult and +15 chips\n3. Saturn - Level up Straight (Level 1→2): +3 Mult and +30 chips\n4. Earth - Level up Full House (Level 1→2): +2 Mult and +25 chips\n5. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (Level 1→2): +3 Mult and +30 chips\n\nTwo Pair is by far my most played hand (9 times vs 4 for Pair/Straight). It's already at Level 3, so leveling it further would give:\n- Current: 60 chips, 4 mult\n- After Uranus: 80 chips, 5 mult\n\nThis would significantly improve my most reliable hand type.\n\nPair is my second most-played (4 times):\n- Current: 25 chips, 3 mult\n- After Mercury: 40 chips, 4 mult\n\nStraight has also been played 4 times:\n- Current: 30 chips, 4 mult\n- After Saturn: 60 chips, 7 mult\n\nThe Saturn upgrade gives more total improvement (+3 mult, +30 chips) compared to Mercury (+1 mult, +15 chips), but I need to consider which hand I'm more likely to play going forward.\n\n\nMy deck composition supports pairs and two pairs well with multiple duplicates, and the Shortcut joker helps me form straights with gaps. Since Two Pair dominates my play history at 9 times and I'm facing escalating chip requirements at Ante 4/8, upgrading it with Uranus makes the most sense—it strengthens my most consistent hand and provides reliable scaling.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
