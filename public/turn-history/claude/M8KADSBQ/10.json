{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $1\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Green Joker (+1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard, currently +0 Mult)\n  2. Merry Andy (+3 discards each round, -1 hand size)\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Big Blind**: 450 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip reward: Foil Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n2. **Upcoming Boss Blind**: 600 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss effect: All Heart cards are debuffed\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nShould I play the Big Blind or skip for the Foil Tag?\n\n**Playing the Big Blind:**\n- Need 450 chips\n- Have 2 jokers: Green Joker and Merry Andy\n- Merry Andy gives me +3 discards (total 6 discards per round) but -1 hand size\n- I'll have 4 hands to play (standard for Big Blind)\n- Green Joker scales: +1 mult per hand played, -1 mult per discard\n- Previous hands: Straight (296 chips), Flush (280 chips)\n- With 2 hands played, those were enough for Small Blind, but need more for Big Blind\n\nLet me estimate if I can beat 450 chips:\n- I have 4 hands to play\n- With Merry Andy, I have 6 discards to cycle through cards\n- Green Joker starts at +0 mult\n- If I play 4 hands, Green Joker will be at +4 mult by the 4th hand\n- If I use 3 discards before playing, Green Joker will be at -3 mult initially\n\n\n- My earlier hands scored 296 and 280 chips with minimal Green Joker scaling, so with +3 or +4 mult added to later hands, I should comfortably exceed 450 chips.\n\n- As Green Joker builds up across hands, a Straight could reach 210 chips at +3 mult, while a Flush could hit 245 chips. Even conservative scaling across 4 hands puts me well over my target.\n\n- The Foil Tag is worth pursuing since it grants a free base edition Joker from the next shop.\n\n- However, skipping Big Blind means losing the $4 reward and jumping straight to Boss Blind, which requires 600 chips and debuffs all Hearts. The Foil edition itself only adds 50 chips when played.\n\n- I should take Big Blind instead. I have solid scaling tools in place, need the money for future shop purchases, and facing Boss Blind unprepared would be riskier. The Foil Tag is nice but not critical right now, and my current trajectory already shows I can comfortably exceed the chip threshold.","action":"\"play_round\""}
