{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $7\n- Just beat the Boss blind with a straight that scored 4,662 chips (one of the Lucky Cards must have triggered!)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n\n**Shop:**\n- Gluttonous Joker: Played cards with Club suit give +3 Mult when scored. Cost: $5\n- The Sun (Tarot): Converts up to 3 selected cards to Hearts. Cost: $3\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards. Cost: $6\n- Jumbo Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards. Cost: $6\n- Clearance Sale Voucher: All cards and packs 25% off. Cost: $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my strategy and what's ahead:\n- I'm entering Ante 4, which means blinds will be significantly harder\n- My main damage comes from Splash (all cards count) + Mystic Summit (+15 mult at 0 discards)\n- I've been relying on straights and full houses/four of a kind\n\nCurrent weaknesses:\n1. I don't have much scaling - my jokers are mostly utility (Merry Andy, Juggler) or conditional (Zany, Mystic Summit)\n\n\n2. Zany Joker hasn't pulled its weight - only triggered 3 times so far\n3. Gluttonous Joker's +3 mult per club isn't strong enough scaling to justify the purchase\n\nThe core strength is Splash enabling every card to contribute, paired with Mystic Summit's multiplier at zero discards. I need to decide whether to invest in another joker or save for better opportunities. With $7, I could grab Gluttonous Joker and have $2 left, but that leaves me vulnerable if I need resources for upcoming rounds.\n\nThe Sun and Jumbo Arcana Pack are possibilities, though neither addresses my immediate scaling needs. Rerolling might surface something more impactful. Looking at my hand progression, Straight and Three of a Kind are both Level 2 with modest returns, while Full House is developing similarly.\n\nI'm leaning toward the Jumbo Arcana Pack for $6. Tarot cards offer flexible utility—enhancing card values, adding editions, or modifying suits—which could unlock better scoring paths than what's currently available. This leaves me with $1, but the potential upside justifies the spend.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
