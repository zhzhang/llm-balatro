{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n5. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips +4 Mult, Enhanced: Mult)\n8. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- I have FOUR QUEENS! (Q♠, Q♥, Q♣, Q♦)\n- I have a Mult-enhanced King of Diamonds that gives +4 mult\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 0 (MYSTIC SUMMIT NOW ACTIVE!)\n- Need: 3000 chips total\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining (NOW ACTIVE!)\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nNow I need to play my Four of a Kind hand. Let me calculate the exact score:\n\n**Four of a Kind (Queens):**\n- Base chips: 60\n- Base mult: 7\n\nAll 8 cards contribute via Splash:\n- Q♠: +10\n- K♥: +10\n- Q♥: +10\n- 8♥: +8\n- Q♣: +10\n- J♣: +10\n- K♦: +10 chips, +4 mult\n- Q♦: +10\n\nTotal chips from cards: 78\nTotal chips: 60 (base) + 78 = 138 chips\n\n\nFor mult:\n- Base: 7\n- Zany Joker (Four of a Kind contains Three of a Kind): +12 → 19 mult\n- K♦ enhancement: +4 mult → 23 mult\n- Mystic Summit (0 discards remaining): +15 mult → 38 mult\n\nTotal score: 138 × 38 = 5,244 chips\n\nThis crushes the 3,000 chip requirement. I'll play all four Queens to trigger the Four of a Kind, which activates both Zany Joker and Mystic Summit's bonuses simultaneously.\n\nSince Splash counts every card in hand regardless of selection, I just need to ensure the Queens form the highest hand. I'll select positions 1, 3, 5, and 8 for the four Queens, plus position 7 for the K♦ to guarantee its mult enhancement scores.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,7,8]"}
