{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Boss Blind: First hand is drawn face down\n- Chips needed: 4000\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 6\n- I just discarded 5 cards and now I can see:\n  1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n  2. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n  3. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n  4. Unknown (face down)\n  5. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n  6. Unknown (face down)\n  7. Unknown (face down)\n  8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- I have K-J-10 of Spades (3 cards toward a straight or flush)\n- I have 3 unknown cards still face down\n- I have Splash joker which makes EVERY played card count in scoring\n- I have Mystic Summit (+15 Mult when 0 discards remaining)\n- I have Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince I still have 3 face-down cards, I should discard them to see what I'm working with. I have 6 discards left, which is plenty.\n\nLet me discard the 3 unknown cards (positions 4, 6, 7) to reveal what I have.\n\nActually, looking at my visible cards:\n- K-J-10 of Spades is 3 cards toward a straight flush potentially\n- If I can get Q and 9 or A and Q of Spades, I'd have a straight flush or royal flush\n\nBut I should first reveal all my cards before making decisions.\n\nLet me discard the 3 unknown cards plus maybe the weak cards (4 of Clubs and 2 of Diamonds) to get fresh draws.\n\n\nI'll start by revealing the mystery cards in positions 4, 6, and 7 to understand my full hand before committing to a larger discard strategy.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,6,7]"}
