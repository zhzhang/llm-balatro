{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 10 - About to face Boss Blind\n- Money: $4\n- Jokers (5/5): Merry Andy, Zany Joker, Splash, Mystic Summit, Juggler\n- Consumables (1/2): Pluto (High Card level up)\n- Hieroglyph voucher (-1 Ante, -1 hand each round)\n\n**Recent Changes:**\n- Just used Earth to level up Full House from Level 1 to Level 2 (now 65 chips, 6 mult)\n- Full House scored 3,906 chips at Level 1, so Level 2 should score even better\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Madness - $7 (too expensive, bad effect - destroys joker)\n2. Sly Joker - $3 (+50 chips for Pair)\n3. Standard Pack - $4\n4. Director's Cut - $10 (too expensive)\n5. Reroll - $5 (more than I have)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $4 left. I'm about to face the Boss Blind of Ante 3, which will require a significant chip threshold (likely 4,500-5,500+).\n\nMy key strengths:\n1. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring (VERY powerful)\n2. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult at 0 discards\n3. Merry Andy - +3 discards per round\n4. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nRecent scoring:\n- Four of a Kind: 4,180 chips\n- Full House: 3,906 chips (at Level 1, now Level 2)\n\nOptions:\n1. **Sell Pluto ($1) + buy nothing** - Would have $5, but nothing costs $5 except reroll\n\n\n2. **Buy Sly Joker ($3)** - Would need to sacrifice a joker since I'm at capacity. Sly Joker adds +50 chips to Pairs, which come up frequently, but I'd lose one of my current effects.\n3. **Buy Standard Pack ($4)** - Spend all remaining money on a card pack.\n4. **Sell Pluto ($1) + Reroll ($5)** - Combine the sale with a reroll for $5 total.\n5. **Proceed to next round** - Keep everything as is.\n\nMerry Andy is essential to my strategy, so I need to be careful about what I remove if I make any changes.\n\nZany Joker provides +12 mult for Three of a Kind hands but only triggers sometimes. Splash is non-negotiable since it makes every card contribute to scoring. Mystic Summit is my finisher, giving +15 mult when I have zero discards left. Juggler is the weakest link at just +1 hand size.\n\nIf I swap Juggler for Sly Joker, I'd gain +50 chips per Pair—a much stronger effect. Combined with Splash making each card count, Pairs would score significantly more. The math shows that even a simple Pair would benefit substantially from this combination.\n\nSelling Juggler nets me $2, bringing my total to $6. I could grab Sly Joker for $3 and have $3 remaining, or invest in a Standard Pack for $4 to potentially unlock enhanced cards with better long-term value.\n\nBut I'm facing a Boss Blind soon, and my current Splash + Mystic Summit engine is already performing well. My Four of a Kind just hit 4,180 chips, and I've already leveled Full House to Level 2. The real question is whether I need immediate upgrades or should preserve resources for future shops.\n\nA Standard Pack could deliver multiplier cards, bonus cards, or glass cards that strengthen my hand completion without disrupting my joker synergies. Alternatively, I could sell Pluto for an extra dollar and reroll the shop entirely, but that's speculative. The Standard Pack feels like the more reliable path forward—it directly enhances my deck while keeping my joker setup intact.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
