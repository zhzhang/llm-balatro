{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 2,997\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 1\n- Money: $36\n\n**Chips needed to win:** 10,000 - 2,997 = 7,003 more chips with 2 hands remaining\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult from enhancement, +10 Mult from holo edition = +14 Mult total)\n4. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n5. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nI have THREE 8s: 8♣, 8♦, 8♦. This is a Three of a Kind!\n\nI have 1 discard remaining. If I use it, I'll have 0 discards remaining, which will trigger Mystic Summit for +15 Mult.\n\nLet me calculate the chips for playing Three of a Kind with Mystic Summit active (0 discards):\n\n**Three of a Kind scoring:**\n- Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n\n\n- Base mult: 5 (Level 2)\n\nPlaying the three 8s with King of Clubs and Queen of Diamonds gives me: 8 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 10 = 44 chips from the cards themselves. Combined with the hand's base 50 chips, that's 94 total. For multipliers, I'm getting 5 base, plus 12 from Zany Joker for the Three of a Kind, plus 14 from the enhanced holo 8 of Clubs, and 15 from Mystic Summit when discards hit zero—that's 46 Mult total.\n\nSo this hand scores 94 × 46 = 4,324 chips. Adding my current 2,997 gets me to 7,321, leaving me 2,679 short of my goal. I'm considering whether a Flush with my four Clubs (King, Jack, 8, 7) plus a draw would work better, but I need to decide on my remaining discard first. Using it now triggers Mystic Summit's +15 Mult for this hand, but then I lose that boost for my final hand. Saving it means no Mystic Summit here, but I could apply it where it matters more.\n\nWithout the Mystic Summit, my Three of a Kind would give me 94 chips × 31 Mult = 2,914 chips, bringing my total to just 5,911—requiring 4,089 from my final hand, which seems difficult. I'm leaning toward using the discard now to activate Mystic Summit for this current hand instead.\n\nIf I use my last discard now, I'll have zero discards left, meaning Mystic Summit stays active through both this hand and my final one. That changes things significantly. After this hand scores 4,324 chips with the multiplier active, I'd reach 7,321 total, needing only 2,679 more on the final hand—much more achievable. The 7 of Clubs is my weakest card at just 7 chips, so discarding it makes sense.\n\nBut I should also consider going for a Flush since I already have four Clubs. If I discard a non-Club and draw another Club, I'd get a Flush with Mystic Summit active. The math shows roughly 3,325 chips from that route, which is less than the 4,324 I'd get from my current hand. This approach is less efficient than my original plan.\n\nI'll stick with Three of a Kind. Since all cards count toward scoring with Splash active, I need to pick which card to discard carefully. The 7 of Clubs is my weakest option at just 7 chips, so that's what I should remove. Now I'm deciding between keeping the King and Queen versus the King and Jack for my final hand.\n\nActually, there's a strategic angle here—if I draw another 8, I'd hit Four of a Kind, which would jump my scoring significantly to around 102+ chips with a multiplier of 36. That's worth considering as I make my discard decision.\n\nBut wait, calculating the full potential: 102 × 36 gives roughly 3,672 chips. That's actually lower than sticking with Three of a Kind, since the Zany Joker bonus of +12 Mult for the three-of-a-kind hand is more valuable than what Four of a Kind would provide. I'll discard the 7 of Clubs and keep the current hand.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4]"}
