{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind**: 2,000 chips needed, Reward: $3, Skip tag: Handy Tag (gives $1 per played hand, would give $12 total)\n2. **Big Blind**: 3,000 chips needed, Reward: $4, Skip tag: Coupon Tag (free cards/boosters in next shop)\n3. **Boss Blind**: 2,000 chips needed, Reward: $5, Boss effect: \"Play only 1 hand\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +1 Mult (scales with hands played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Boss Blind is particularly scary - \"Play only 1 hand\" means I get ONE shot to hit 2,000 chips. Let me calculate if I can hit that with a Three of a Kind play:\n\nBase Three of a Kind (Level 2): 50 chips, 5 mult\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult = 17 mult total\n- Green Joker: +1 mult = 18 mult total\n- Mystic Summit: +15 mult (if 0 discards) = 33 mult total\n\nIf I play three 10s (each worth 10 chips), that's:\n\n\n- Base: 50 chips\n- 3 cards x 10 chips each = 30 chips (thanks to Splash, all cards count)\n- Total: 80 chips\n- 80 chips × 33 mult = 2,640 chips\n\nThat should be enough! But I only get ONE hand attempt.\n\nHowever, the Handy Tag is worth considering - I've already played 12 hands this run, so skipping it would cost me $12 immediately plus future earnings. The Coupon Tag offers free cards and boosters next shop, which could strengthen my deck significantly.\n\nComparing the two: taking Handy gives me $9 net gain after accounting for the Small Blind reward I'd forfeit, bringing me to $17 for better shop options. The Coupon Tag requires hitting 3,000 chips on Big Blind, which is challenging but potentially worth the savings on future purchases.\n\nLooking at my recent performance—hitting 2,480 chips on the last boss hand with Three of a Kind—I'm confident I can reach 2,000 for Small Blind. With Merry Andy giving me extra discards, finding strong hands should be manageable. The \"Play only 1 hand\" Boss Blind is risky but doable if I draw the right cards.\n\nI'll play through Small Blind rather than skip it. The $3 reward matters for progression, and I'd rather not immediately face Big Blind afterward without that buffer.","action":"\"play_round\""}
