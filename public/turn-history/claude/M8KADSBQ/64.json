{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8 (was 3/8, now reduced by Hieroglyph)\n- Round: 7 (just finished Small Blind)\n- Current Money: $1\n- In SHOP phase\n\n**Current Jokers (5/5 slots full):**\n1. Green Joker: +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +1 Mult) - Sells for $2\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size - Sells for $3\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind - Sells for $2\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring - Sells for $1\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining - Sells for $2\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- The Magician (Tarot): Enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards - $3\n- Lusty Joker: +3 Mult per Heart card scored - $5\n- Standard Pack x2: $4 each\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $1, so I can't afford to buy anything in the current shop. My options are:\n1. Sell a joker to get more money\n2. Round select to continue to the next blind\n\nLet me think about whether I should sell anything:\n\n**Green Joker** - Currently at +1 Mult. This joker is quite weak and loses value when I discard. It's not contributing much. Sells for $2.\n\n**Merry Andy** - +3 discards is very valuable, though -1 hand size is a drawback. With Hieroglyph now reducing hands by 1 per round as well, I'll have fewer hands to work with. Sells for $3.\n\n**Zany Joker** - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind is quite strong and I've been playing Three of a Kind successfully. \n\nGreen Joker and Mystic Summit are both weak performers right now—the former barely contributes and the latter hasn't been useful since I'm actively discarding. Either could be sold for $2 to reach $3, enough for The Magician. Alternatively, selling Merry Andy would give me $4, though losing those extra discards would hurt my flexibility.\n\nThe Magician's appeal is converting cards to Lucky Cards with decent upside—the +20 Mult or $20 payouts could compound my damage. I'd want to target high-frequency cards like face cards and Aces that show up in my Pairs and Three of a Kinds. My current damage engine relies on Zany Joker's Three of a Kind bonus and Splash making all cards count, so adding Lucky variance to my most-played cards could be a meaningful boost. The question is whether that upside justifies the opportunity cost of what I'd have to sacrifice. to Ante 3. Since I only have $1 and can't afford anything right now, and my Three of a Kind strategy is already performing well, I could just move forward and save my jokers. But selling Green Joker for The Magician feels like the stronger play—Green Joker isn't pulling its weight, and The Magician's Lucky Card synergy could significantly boost my multiplier output. I'll make that trade.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
