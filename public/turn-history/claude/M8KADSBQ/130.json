{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 7\n- Money: $16\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n3. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n4. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 for $20)\n5. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 for $20)\n7. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n8. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need 10,000 chips and must play exactly 5 cards per hand due to the Boss requirement.\n\nCurrent hand contains:\n- Pair of Kings (King of Spades, King of Hearts)\n- Pair of 3s (3 of Spades, 3 of Diamonds)\n- Pair of Aces (Ace of Hearts, Ace of Clubs) - both Lucky cards!\n- 4 of Spades\n- 6 of Clubs\n\n\n- \nI can form multiple Two Pair combinations: Kings with 3s, Kings with Aces, or Aces with 3s, each scoring 20 base chips with 2x multiplier. Since Splash counts every card I play toward the score, the mandatory 5-card play actually works in my favor—I'll get more chip contributions from additional cards beyond the pair itself.\n\nFor a Two Pair like Kings and 3s plus an Ace, I'd score the base 20 chips plus all five card values (10 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 11 = 37 additional chips), totaling 57 chips before multiplier. The Ace of Hearts could also trigger Lucky for a potential +20 multiplier boost with a 1 in 5 chance.\n\nBut wait—I need to reconsider the scoring rules. Card values only count toward the total if they're actually part of the hand being played. So for a Two Pair using Kings and 3s, only those four cards contribute their chip values (10 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 26), not the fifth card unless it participates in the hand itself.\n\nHowever, Splash changes this entirely. The card explicitly states \"Every played card counts in scoring,\" which means all five cards contribute their values regardless of whether they form part of the poker hand. With Splash active and playing Kings + 3s + Ace of Hearts, I'd get 20 base chips plus all five card values (10 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 11), multiplied by the base multiplier of 2, yielding 114 chips total. That's still insufficient for my goal. I need to explore other hand combinations and consider which jokers might amplify the scoring more effectively.\n\nLooking at my available jokers, Zany Joker triggers on Three of a Kind hands and grants +12 multiplier, but I currently only have pairs. With seven discards remaining, I can cycle through cards to build toward Three of a Kind, Flush, or Straight—all of which offer better base values and multipliers than my current hand.\n\nHowever, I should account for Mystic Summit's bonus: it grants +15 multiplier when I finish a round with zero discards left. This means I should strategically use all seven discards to construct the strongest possible hand, then play it with no discards remaining to activate that multiplier bonus. I'll start discarding the weakest cards—the 4 of Spades, 6 of Clubs, and 3 of Diamonds—to make room for better draws.\n\nWait, I'm holding pairs of Kings, Aces, and 3s. The Aces have Lucky attached, which gives them a chance at +20 multiplier, so keeping them makes sense. Rather than discard indiscriminately, I should focus on cards that don't contribute to strong hand combinations. My goal is to either complete a Three of a Kind from my existing pairs, or draw into a Straight or Flush. Let me be more deliberate about which cards to cycle through.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,7,8]"}
