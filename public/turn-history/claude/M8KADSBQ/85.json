{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers (5/5 - FULL):\n  1. Merry Andy (+3 discards, -1 hand size)\n  2. Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n  3. Splash (all played cards count)\n  4. Mystic Summit (+15 Mult when 0 discards)\n  5. Misprint (+random mult)\n- Consumables (2/2 - FULL):\n  1. The Magician (enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards)\n  2. Pluto (levels up High Card)\n\n**Blind Select Options:**\n1. **Current Blind: Small**\n   - Chips Needed: 2000\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Tag for skipping: Voucher Tag (adds one voucher to next shop)\n\n2. **Upcoming Blind: Big**\n   - Chips Needed: 3000\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Tag for skipping: Rare Tag (shop has a free Rare Joker)\n\n3. **Upcoming Blind: Boss**\n   - Chips Needed: 4000\n   - Reward: $5\n   - Boss Description: First hand is drawn face down\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- I beat the Small Blind of Ante 3 with 1,818 chips (Three of a Kind) and 840 chips (Pair)\n- I have strong synergy with my jokers for Three of a Kind, Two Pair, and Pair\n\nThe Small Blind needs 2000 chips. Looking at my last played hands:\n- Three of a Kind gave me 1,818 chips in Ante 3 Small Blind\n\n\n- Two Pair gave me 1,650 chips in Ante 2 Boss\n\nMy current joker setup—Zany Joker boosting Three of a Kind, Splash counting all played cards, and Mystic Summit providing bonus multiplier at zero discards—should comfortably exceed 2000 chips with either Three of a Kind or Two Pair.\n\n**Should I skip for the Voucher Tag?**\n\nThe Voucher Tag adds one voucher to the next shop, which could be valuable for future purchases.\n\nHowever, I already have Hieroglyph (reducing Ante by 1 is significant), I'm only sitting on $5 so voucher options are limited anyway, and skipping means losing the $3 reward and jumping straight to the Big Blind's 3000 chip requirement.\n\n**Should I play the Small Blind?**\n\nI can definitely beat 2000 chips with my current hand strength. The $3 reward plus access to the shop afterward outweighs the Voucher Tag, especially since I've already got a solid voucher in Hieroglyph. Playing through maintains my progression without unnecessary risk.\n\nLet me go ahead and play this round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
