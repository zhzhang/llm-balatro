{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8 (reduced from 3/8 by Hieroglyph voucher)\n- Round: 7 (just finished Small Blind)\n- Current Money: $0\n- In SHOP phase\n- I have 4/5 joker slots filled\n- I have 1/2 consumable slots filled (The Magician)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Magician - Enhances 2 selected cards to Lucky Cards\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Lusty Joker: +3 Mult per Heart card scored - $5\n- Standard Pack x2: $4 each\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $0 and just bought The Magician consumable. I can't afford to buy anything else in the shop. My options are:\n\n1. Use The Magician now if I want to enhance cards (but I'm in the shop, not in a round with cards in hand)\n2. Round select to continue to the next blind\n\nSince I'm in the SHOP phase and don't have cards in hand to use The Magician on, I should proceed to the round select. I'll use The Magician during the actual round when I have cards in hand to target.\n\nLooking at my strategy:\n- I've been successfully playing Pairs (Level 2) and Three of a Kind (Level 2)\n- My jokers support this strategy well (Zany Joker for Three of a Kind, Splash for all cards counting)\n- The Magician will enhance 2 cards to Lucky Cards, which will give me a chance at +20 Mult when those cards are scored\n\n\n- With no funds remaining, I need to move forward to the next blind and generate chips to continue building my deck.","action":"\"round_select\""}
