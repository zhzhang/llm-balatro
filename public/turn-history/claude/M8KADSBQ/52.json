{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6 (just finished round 6 of ante 2, now in ante 3)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**My Jokers (at max capacity of 5):**\n1. Green Joker: +1 Mult per hand played, -1 per discard (currently +1)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**My Consumables:**\n- None (0/2)\n\n**Shop Items:**\n1. The Lovers (Tarot): Enhances 1 card into Wild Card - $3\n2. Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n3. Jumbo Spectral Pack: Choose 1 of 4 Spectral cards - $6\n4. Hieroglyph (Voucher): -1 Ante, -1 hand each round - $10\n5. Current Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5 (just leveled up!)\n- Pair: Level 2, Base Chips 25, Base Mult 3\n- Straight: Level 2, Base Chips 60, Base Mult 7\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nI just successfully used Venus to level up Three of a Kind from Level 1 to Level 2, increasing it from 30 chips/3 mult to 50 chips/5 mult. This is excellent for my strategy since I have Zany Joker (+12 Mult on Three of a Kind).\n\n\n---\n\nWith $5 remaining, I'm weighing whether to invest in card enhancements or refresh the shop. The Lovers could add consistency through Wild Cards, but my deck doesn't heavily depend on suit requirements. The Standard Pack offers deck improvement for $4, leaving minimal funds. Rerolling would spend everything but might reveal better options aligned with my Three of a Kind focus.\n\nAlternatively, I could bank the money and advance. My current joker setup—Zany Joker, leveled Three of a Kind, Splash for value multiplication, Mystic Summit's +15 Mult at zero discards, and Merry Andy's extra discards—feels solid. Green Joker continues scaling in the background. Since Ante 3 demands substantially higher chip thresholds, I should consider whether my existing synergies can handle the jump or if I need to strengthen my deck now. priority.\n\n**Should I buy Standard Pack?**\nFor $4, I get to choose 1 of 3 cards. This could improve my deck composition, but I don't know what the deck improvement would be. My deck seems reasonable as is.\n\n**Should I proceed to round_select?**\nSaving $5 for the next shop could be valuable. After beating small and big blinds, I'll have more money to work with.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think the best option is to **reroll the shop**. Here's why:\n1. I have exactly $5, which is the reroll cost\n2. I'm entering Ante 3 where requirements will be much higher\n3. Finding another planet card to level up Three of a Kind or Pair would be extremely valuable\n4. Finding a better joker could significantly improve my strategy (though I'd need to sell one)\n5. The current shop doesn't offer anything that directly addresses my scoring gap.\n\nI'll reroll and hope for planet cards or stronger jokers that can help me meet the much tougher Ante 3 thresholds. - Good jokers would require selling an existing joker, and Tarot cards like The Lovers aren't particularly valuable for my current strategy\n\nI think I should just proceed to round_select and save the $5. My strategy is already strong after beating the Boss Blind, and keeping the money gives me better buying power in the next shop. The current items aren't worth the cost, and I'll earn money through interest and leftover hands during the rounds anyway.","action":"\"round_select\""}
