{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2 (Big Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 450\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 7 (thanks to Merry Andy giving +3)\n- Money: $1\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: 6 of Spades\n2: 5 of Spades\n3: 2 of Spades\n4: 8 of Clubs\n5: 6 of Clubs\n6: 5 of Clubs\n7: 3 of Diamonds\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker - Currently +0 Mult (+1 per hand played, -1 per discard)\n2. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLet me check what hands I can make:\n- Spades: 6, 5, 2 (not enough for flush)\n- Clubs: 8, 6, 5 (not enough for flush)\n- Pairs: 6 of Spades + 6 of Clubs (pair of 6s)\n        5 of Spades + 5 of Clubs (pair of 5s)\n- Two Pair: 6-6-5-5 (Two Pair)\n- No straights possible (6, 5, 2, 8, 6, 5, 3 - no 5-card sequence)\n- No three of a kind\n\nBest hand currently: **Two Pair** (6s and 5s)\n\nLet me calculate the expected chips for Two Pair:\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult\n- Cards in the hand: 6+6+5+5 = 22 chips\n- Total chips: 20+22 = 42 chips\n\n\n- Mult: 2 (base) + 0 (Green Joker) = 2\n- Total: 42 × 2 = 84 chips\n\nThat's well short of the 450 chip target. With 7 discards available, I should hunt for stronger hands like flushes or straights rather than settling for this weak two pair.\n\nThe remaining deck skews toward Hearts with 13 cards, while Diamonds has 12 and both Clubs and Spades have 10 each. This makes building a Heart flush a viable path. Still, I'll keep the 6-6-5-5 as insurance in case my draws don't pan out.\n\nI need to average around 112.5 chips per hand across my 4 remaining plays. Since I've already scored 296 on a Straight and 280 on a Flush, landing even one more hand at that level would put me well over 450. With 7 discards to work with, I should aggressively pursue high-value combinations rather than play it safe.\n\nThe two pairs only yield 84 chips—not enough. I'm better off discarding low cards like the 2 of Spades and 3 of Diamonds, then drawing toward flushes, straights, or three-of-a-kind hands that could score significantly higher.\n\nI'll be aggressive here: keep one pair as a safety net and dump the rest. Discarding the 2 of Spades, 8 of Clubs, both 5s, and the 3 of Diamonds leaves me with the pair of 6s, giving me a foundation while I hunt for something stronger. This keeps the pair of 6s, though that's only useful if I draw into trips or two pair. Maybe I should discard everything instead and start completely fresh.\n\nIf I discard all five cards (6 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 2 of Spades, 8 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs), I'd keep just the 5 of Clubs and 3 of Diamonds—but that doesn't seem strong either. I need to think about this more systematically. The real strategy should focus on discarding the weakest cards and those that don't contribute to any viable hand, starting with the 2 of Spades since it's the lowest value card. 5 new cards, hoping to hit another 6 or build toward a flush or straight.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,7]"}
