{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\nCurrent Hand:\n1: 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n2: 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n3: 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n4: 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n5: King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6: 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7: 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n8: 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n\nNeed to reach: 300 chips\nRemaining hands: 4\nRemaining discards: 4\n\nLet me look for possible hands:\n- Pair of 7s: Position 3 (7 of Hearts) and Position 7 (7 of Clubs)\n- No straights visible\n- Clubs flush potential: 5, 6, 7, 8 (King, 10, 7, 3 of Clubs) - that's 4 clubs\n- Hearts flush potential: 2, 3, 4 (9, 7, 2 of Hearts) - that's 3 hearts\n\nLet me calculate what I could get from different hands:\n\nOption 1: Play the pair of 7s (positions 3 and 7)\n- Base chips for pair: 10\n- Chips from the 7s: 7 + 7 = 14\n- Total chips: 24\n- Base mult for pair: 2\n- Total score: 24 × 2 = 48 chips\n\nThat's way too low. I need 300 chips total.\n\nOption 2: Play a high card with the King\n- Base chips: 5\n- King chips: 10\n- Total chips: 15\n- Base mult: 1\n- Total score: 15 × 1 = 15 chips\n\nEven worse.\n\nLet me think about discarding to improve my hand. With 4 discards available, I could try to build towards:\n\n\n- A flush (need 5 cards of same suit)\n- A straight\n- Three of a kind or better\n\nI have 4 clubs already, so if I discard the non-club cards (4 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts), I'd draw 4 new cards with a solid chance of completing a flush. A flush scores 35 base chips, which is much stronger than what I'm seeing now.\n\nLet me work through the math: if I land a clubs flush with King, 10, 7, 3 plus one more club, I'm looking at roughly 35 base chips plus 30-40 from the cards themselves, giving me 65-75 total chips multiplied by 4 for a score around 260-300. That's close to what I need, but it depends on drawing that fifth club.\n\nThe pair of 7s alone won't cut it. I need to think about my remaining hands—I have 4 total to work with, so averaging 75 chips per hand would get me to 300 total.\n\nI should discard the weaker cards and chase a flush. Dropping the 4 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, and 2 of Hearts keeps my four clubs intact and gives me a shot at completing the flush with a fifth club draw.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4]"}
