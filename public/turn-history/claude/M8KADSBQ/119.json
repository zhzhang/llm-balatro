{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state carefully.\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n4. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n5. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n6. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n7. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n8. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- I have K-Q-J-10-4 of Spades (5 Spades = Flush)\n- I have THREE Queens: Q♠, Q♥, Q♣ (Three of a Kind!)\n- I have TWO Jacks: J♠, J♥\n- Chips needed: 4000\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler: +1 hand size\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n\n1. **Three of a Kind (Queens)**: Q♠, Q♥, Q♣\n   - Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n   - Base mult: 5 (Level 2)\n   - With Splash, ALL 8 cards contribute chips:\n     - K♠ (10), Q♠ (10), J♠ (10), 10♠ (10), 4♠ (4), Q♥ (10), J♥ (10), Q♣ (10) = 74 chips\n   - Total chips: 50 + 74 = 124 chips\n   - Mult: 5 (base) + 12 (Zany Joker for Three of a Kind) = 17 mult\n   - If I use all discards first to trigger Mystic Summit: 17 + 15 = 32 mult\n   - Total: 124 × 32 = 3,968 chips (VERY CLOSE but not quite 4000!)\n\n2. **Flush (5 Spades)**: K♠, Q♠, J♠, 10♠, 4♠\n   - Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n   - Base mult: 6 (Level 2)\n   - Splash activates all 8 cards in hand: K♠, Q♠, J♠, 10♠, 4♠, Q♥, J♥, Q♣ contribute 74 chips total\n   - Combined chips: 124, but mult only reaches 21 with Mystic Summit at 0 discards, yielding 2,604 chips—insufficient\n\n3. **Full House (Queens + Jacks)**: Q♠, Q♥, Q♣, J♠, J♥\n   - Base chips: 65 (Level 2)\n   - Splash adds the same 74 chips from remaining cards, totaling 139 chips\n   - With 21 mult, this scores 2,919 chips—still not enough\n\nThe Three of a Kind with Zany Joker remains the strongest play at 3,968 chips, though I'm still 32 chips short of the target.\n\nLet me reconsider the scoring more carefully. With Splash active, every card I play contributes its chip value to the final score. Playing all 8 cards means the three Queens form the hand while the other five cards (K♠, J♠, 10♠, 4♠, J♥) add their values through Splash. The base chips for Three of a Kind is 50, plus those 74 chips from all cards equals 124 chips total. The multiplier comes from the base 5 for Three of a Kind plus 12 from Zany Joker and 15 from Mystic Summit, giving me 32x. That's 124 × 32 = 3,968 chips—still 32 short of my goal.\n\nI could use my remaining 4 discards to hunt for better cards. If I can draw an Ace or 9 of Spades, I might complete a Straight or even a Royal Flush, which would give me the 100 base chips I need to push past 4000.\n\nBut the odds are tight—only 6 cards out of 35 remaining in the deck would help me. Instead, I should focus on maximizing Mystic Summit by discarding 4 more cards, then playing all 8 cards together. With Splash triggering on all 8 cards, I'd get 174 chips × 23 multiplier = 4,002 chips total. That would work. activate Mystic Summit, and I'll see what I draw.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8]"}
