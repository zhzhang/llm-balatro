Green Joker - Currently +0 Mult (+1 per hand played, -1 per discard)\\n2. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\\n\\n**Possible Hands:**\\nLet me check what hands I can make:\\n- Spades: 6, 5, 2 (not enough for flush)\\n- Clubs: 8, 6, 5 (not enough for flush)\\n- Pairs: 6 of Spades + 6 of Clubs (pair of 6s)\\n        5 of Spades + 5 of Clubs (pair of 5s)\\n- Two Pair: 6-6-5-5 (Two Pair)\\n- No straights possible (6, 5, 2, 8, 6, 5, 3 - no 5-card sequence)\\n- No three of a kind\\n\\nBest hand currently: **Two Pair** (6s and 5s)\\n\\nLet me calculate the expected chips for Two Pair:\\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult\\n- Cards in the hand: 6+6+5+5 = 22 chips\\n- Total chips: 20+22 = 42 chips\\n\\n\\n- Mult: 2 (base) + 0 (Green Joker) = 2\\n- Total: 42 \\u00d7 2 = 84 chips\\n\\nThat's well short of the 450 chip target. With 7 discards available, I should hunt for stronger hands like flushes or straights rather than settling for this weak two pair.\\n\\nThe remaining deck skews toward Hearts with 13 cards, while Diamonds has 12 and both Clubs and Spades have 10 each. This makes building a Heart flush a viable path. Still, I'll keep the 6-6-5-5 as insurance in case my draws don't pan out.\\n\\nI need to average around 112.5 chips per hand across my 4 remaining plays. Since I've already scored 296 on a Straight and 280 on a Flush, landing even one more hand at that level would put me well over 450. With 7 discards to work with, I should aggressively pursue high-value combinations rather than play it safe.\\n\\nThe two pairs only yield 84 chips\\u2014not enough. I'm better off discarding low cards like the 2 of Spades and 3 of Diamonds, then drawing toward flushes, straights, or three-of-a-kind hands that could score significantly higher.\\n\\nI'll be aggressive here: keep one pair as a safety net and dump the rest. Discarding the 2 of Spades, 8 of Clubs, both 5s, and the 3 of Diamonds leaves me with the pair of 6s, giving me a foundation while I hunt for something stronger. This keeps the pair of 6s, though that's only useful if I draw into trips or two pair. Maybe I should discard everything instead and start completely fresh.\\n\\nIf I discard all five cards (6 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 2 of Spades, 8 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs), I'd keep just the 5 of Clubs and 3 of Diamonds\\u2014but that doesn't seem strong either. I need to think about this more systematically. The real strategy should focus on discarding the weakest cards and those that don't contribute to any viable hand, starting with the 2 of Spades since it's the lowest value card. 5 new cards, hoping to hit another 6 or build toward a flush or straight.\\nCommand: discard 2 3 4 6 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 13]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Green Joker.

The pair of 6s won't cut it, so I should discard and hunt for stronger combinations. Looking at what's left in the deck, Hearts are most abundant with 13 cards remaining, followed by Diamonds with 10, Spades with 9, and Clubs with 8. A flush seems like the most achievable high-value hand. The current hand lacks potential, so I should discard most cards and redraw. I'm considering dropping the 3\\u2660, A\\u2663, K\\u2663, 8\\u2666, and 5\\u2666 while keeping the pair of 6s for their 22 chips. However, discarding five cards triggers another Green Joker penalty, pushing it to -2 mult. Each discard compounds the penalty\\u2014after three discards I'd be at -3 mult\\u2014so I need to weigh whether a fresh draw justifies the scaling cost. d: -1 mult\\n- Fourth hand: 0 mult\\n\\nThe negative multiplier is really dragging down my score. I should try playing a hand soon to get the Green Joker multiplier working in my favor, even if it's not perfect. A pair of 6s at -1 mult only gives around 22 chips though, which is too weak.\\n\\nI'll discard 5 cards to improve my odds of getting a stronger hand: 3 of Spades, Ace of Clubs, King of Clubs, 8 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds.

Green Joker - Currently -2 Mult (I've used 2 discards, so -2 mult)\\n2. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\\n\\n**Possible Hands:**\\nLet me check what hands I can make:\\n- Pairs: 6 of Spades + 6 of Clubs (pair of 6s)\\n         2 of Hearts + 2 of Clubs (pair of 2s)\\n- Two Pair: 6-6-2-2 (Two Pair)\\n- Spades: King, 6 (not enough for flush)\\n- Hearts: 4, 2 (not enough for flush)\\n- Clubs: Queen, 6, 2 (not enough for flush)\\n- No straights possible\\n- No three of a kind\\n\\nBest hand currently: **Two Pair** (6s and 2s)\\n\\nLet me calculate the expected chips for Two Pair:\\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult\\n- Cards in the hand: 6+6+2+2 = 16 chips\\n- Total chips: 20+16 = 36 chips\\n\\n\\n- Mult: 2 (base) + (-2) (Green Joker after 2 discards) = 0\\n- Total: 36 \\u00d7 0 = 0 chips\\n\\nThis is a problem. With the Green Joker at -2 multiplier, playing any hand now would result in zero chips. I need to discard strategically to reduce the Green Joker's penalty before playing a hand, or find a way to build a stronger hand that can overcome this multiplier issue.\\n\\nThe challenge is that each additional discard makes the Green Joker worse in the short term. If I discard again, it drops to -3, then -4, and so on. But once I start playing hands, the multiplier gradually improves with each hand played. With only 4 hands remaining, I'm in a tight spot\\u2014I need to balance getting better cards against the mounting penalty from the Green Joker. Playing too early with weak cards and a negative multiplier wastes my remaining hands, but waiting too long means I'll have even fewer hands to recover from the penalty.\\n\\nWait, I'm looking at the Green Joker description again and it says \\\"Currently +0 Mult\\\"\\u2014that contradicts my earlier calculation. If it's actually at +0 right now despite using 2 discards, then either the multiplier resets each round or the display is showing the net value after accounting for all discards. Let me reconsider the math with this in mind.\\n\\nIf I play a Two Pair now, I'd get 36 chips \\u00d7 2 mult = 72 chips total. That's nowhere near the 112.5 chips per hand I need on average. The real issue is my hand is too weak. With 5 discards and 4 hands remaining, I should keep discarding to chase better hands like flushes or straights. Looking at what's left in the deck, Hearts are the most abundant at 11 cards, so building toward a Hearts flush makes sense. I'll discard non-Heart cards to improve my odds.\\n\\nGoing through my current hand: the King and 6 of Spades, Queen and two 6s of Clubs are all dead weight\\u2014I'll get rid of those. The 4 and 2 of Hearts are worth keeping since they're my foundation for a flush draw. That leaves me discarding five cards and holding two Hearts.\\n\\nBut actually, I should reconsider whether playing this Two Pair now is better than continuing to discard. If I play it for 72 chips, I'd need 126 chips per hand from my remaining three hands to hit my target\\u2014that's achievable with flushes or straights. The question is whether my odds of hitting those hands are better than what I'd get by discarding more now.\\n\\nPlaying also bumps Green Joker up by one, which helps my future hands. Still, 72 chips feels too small to lock in. I have five discards remaining, so I can afford to be aggressive here. I'll discard the non-Hearts and try to build toward a flush instead.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 5 6 7\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Green Joker.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2 (Big Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 450\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $1\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n2: 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n3: 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n4: 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n5: 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n6: 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n7: 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker - Currently +0 Mult (I've used 3 discards, but it shows +0)\n2. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLet me check:\n- Pairs: 8♠ + 8♥ (pair of 8s), 4♠ + 4♥ (pair of 4s), 9♣ + 9♦ (pair of 9s)\n- Two Pair: 8-8-4-4, 8-8-9-9, 4-4-9-9\n- Three of a Kind: None\n- Full House: None\n- Flushes: \n  - Spades: 8, 4 (only 2, need 5)\n  - Hearts: 8, 4, 2 (only 3, need 5)\n  - Clubs: 9 (only 1, need 5)\n  - Diamonds: 9 (only 1, need 5)\n- Straights: None (8, 4, 8, 4, 2, 9, 9 - no 5-card sequence)\n\n\n- Best hand: Two Pair with 9-9-8-8 gives 20 base chips and 2x multiplier. Adding the card values (9+9+8+8 = 34), I get 54 chips total, which multiplies to 108 chips. That falls short of my 112.5 chip target per hand, but I need to consider how the Green Joker might help close that gap.\n\nThe Green Joker's display shows \"+0 Mult\" currently, yet according to its effect (\"+1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard\"), it should be at -3 after three discards this round with no hands played. The fact that it consistently displayed \"+0 Mult\" across turns 12, 13, and 14—even as discards accumulated—suggests the multiplier either resets between rounds or the display reflects something different than the running total.\n\nIf the Green Joker is actually at -3 right now, playing Two Pair would give me 54 chips × (2 base mult - 3) = -54 chips, which seems impossible. This means multipliers likely have a floor—either clamped at 0 or 1—so the actual calculation would be 54 × max(1, 2 - 3) = 54 chips.\n\nThat's minimal output, but playing a hand would increment the Green Joker to -2, making future hands progressively stronger. With 4 hands remaining and needing 450 total chips, I need to average 112.5 per hand. The core tension is that discarding further worsens the Green Joker while playing now—even weakly—starts the recovery process. I should play to begin rebuilding the multiplier rather than dig deeper into the hole.\n\nLet me map out the scenarios. The Green Joker applies +1 mult per hand played and -1 mult per discard. If I play four consecutive hands from here, the multiplier would climb from -3 to -2, then -1, then 0, then +1. Alternatively, if I discard more first, the multiplier drops further before I can recover it. If I play Two Pair (9-9-8-8) now, I'd score 54 chips × 2 mult = 108 chips, and the Green Joker increments to +1. On subsequent hands, the multiplier keeps climbing—hand 2 at +1 could yield ~120 chips, hand 3 at +2 around ~140, and hand 4 at +3 roughly ~160. That totals approximately 528 chips, surpassing the 450 threshold. Playing immediately appears to be the stronger move compared to waiting.\n\nAlternatively, I could discard the non-Hearts and try to complete a flush since 10 Hearts remain in the deck and I already have 3. However, with only 30 cards left, drawing 4 cards gives me an expected 1.33 Hearts—likely not enough to guarantee the flush. The guaranteed 108 chips from playing now and advancing the Green Joker seems more reliable.\n\nI'll play the Two Pair by selecting positions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 (8♠, 8♥, 4♥, 9♣, 9♦) to form 9-9-8-8.\n\nWait, that includes the 4♥ which doesn't belong in this hand. Let me reconsider the available cards: I have two 8s (positions 1 and 3), two 9s (positions 6 and 7), two 4s (positions 2 and 4), and a 2♥. The strongest Two Pair I can make is 9-9-8-8 using positions 1, 3, 6, 7 plus the 2♥ as my fifth card, which totals 34 chips in value."
