{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 7\n- Boss Effect: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades - +10 chips\n2. 8 of Spades - +8 chips\n3. 2 of Spades - +2 chips\n4. 5 of Hearts - +5 chips\n5. King of Diamonds (Mult Card) - +10 chips +4 Mult\n6. Queen of Diamonds - +10 chips\n7. Jack of Diamonds - +10 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +7 Mult (currently)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy previous plan was to use all 7 discards first to activate Mystic Summit's +15 Mult bonus when I reach 0 discards remaining. However, I need to be careful:\n\n1. Green Joker gets -1 Mult per discard, so if I discard 7 times, it will go from +7 to 0 Mult\n2. Green Joker gets +1 Mult per hand played, so playing hands will increase it\n\nLet me reconsider the strategy. If I discard all 7 times:\n- Green Joker: +7 - 7 = 0 Mult\n- Then when I play hands, it will increase again\n\n\n- I can form a Pair of Jacks (Jack of Spades and Jack of Diamonds) from my current hand, which is my strongest option since I don't have three of a kind or a flush. With 7 discards still available, a Pair of Jacks would give me 25 chips and 3 multiplier as the base, then Splash applies to every card I play.\n\n- The pair itself contributes 20 chips, and I can play up to 5 cards total due to Merry Andy's hand size reduction. Green Joker adds 7 multiplier, but Mystic Summit won't activate yet since I still have discards left, and Zany Joker is inactive without three of a kind.\n\n- My strategy should focus on using those 7 discards to cycle toward better hands while working toward activating Mystic Summit at 0 discards. The tradeoff is that each discard reduces Green Joker's multiplier by 1, so I need to weigh whether the Mystic Summit activation is worth the loss. Based on my earlier analysis, I decided to discard all 7 times to trigger Mystic Summit, so I should proceed with that plan.\n\n- Looking at what to discard: the pair of Jacks is solid, but I don't have enough spades for a flush or any straights. I should remove cards that don't strengthen the hand—though I need to be careful about the King of Diamonds since it provides +4 Mult. Splash makes every card count toward chips, so I want to maximize chip value while considering hand composition.\n\nMy approach is to discard strategically to cycle through the deck and find better combinations, then play my strongest hand once I've exhausted my discards. I'll start by removing the lowest-value cards: the 2 of Spades, 8 of Spades, and 5 of Hearts. But I should reconsider discarding more cards at once—maybe 5 total—to get a better refresh while keeping the Jacks and the King of Diamonds for their value. The boss effect draws cards face down after each hand is played, not after discarding, so I'll still see what I draw from my discard.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
