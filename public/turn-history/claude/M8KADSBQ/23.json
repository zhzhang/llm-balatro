{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Shop phase)\n- Current Money: $7\n- I just completed Ante 1 and moved to Ante 2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +3 Mult (increases with hands played, decreases with discards)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\n**Cards:**\n1. Bootstraps - +2 Mult for every $5 you have (Currently +2 Mult) - Cost: $7\n2. To the Moon - Earn an extra $1 of interest for every $5 you have at end of round - Cost: $5\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Jumbo Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards - Cost: $6\n2. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - Cost: $4\n\n**Vouchers:**\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently in shop - Cost: $10\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $7 to spend. Let me think about what would be most valuable:\n\n1. **Bootstraps ($7)** - This joker gives +2 Mult for every $5 I have. Currently it would give +2 Mult (since I have $7). This is not very strong early on when I don't have much money. It could be useful later but right now it's weak.\n\n2. **To the Moon ($5)** - This gives extra interest. At end of round, I get $1 interest per $5, and this doubles it to $2 per $5. \n\nTo the Moon is an economy play that accelerates my money growth, but with only $7 I won't see much benefit this round. If I buy it, I'm left with $2, which doesn't trigger the interest bonus anyway.\n\n3. **Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6)** - Tarot cards can enhance my deck cards or modify jokers. This could be valuable for improving my deck. I'd have $1 left.\n\n4. **Celestial Pack ($4)** - Planet cards level up hand types. Given that I've been playing Straights and Three of a Kind, leveling these up could be very valuable.\n\nI'd have $3 left. The reroll option at $5 would let me hunt for better jokers, leaving me with $2. Looking at what I've actually played—Straights twice, Three of a Kind once, plus Pair, Two Pair, and Flush—my Zany Joker's conditional bonus for Three of a Kind is strong but inconsistent. My current setup with Green Joker for scaling, Merry Andy for extra discards to fish for hands, and Zany Joker for that Three of a Kind spike seems solid, but I need to decide whether to invest in economy, card enhancement, hand leveling, or search for better jokers.\n\nThe Celestial Pack at $4 stands out because leveling Three of a Kind and Straight—my most-played hands—would boost both their chip and mult values, synergizing perfectly with my Zany Joker. That leaves $3 for future rounds. The Jumbo Arcana Pack at $6 could enhance individual cards with Mult or Bonus effects, though I'd only have $1 remaining. I'm leaning toward the Celestial Pack since hand leveling compounds my existing joker synergies better than card enhancements would at this stage.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
