{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Just won the Small Blind with 3,906 chips (Full House)\n- Currently in the SHOP phase\n- Money: $11\n- Ante 3/8, Round 9\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Misprint - Random mult bonus\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Juggler - +1 hand size for $4\n2. Jupiter (Planet) - Level up Flush for $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - $4\n2. Standard Pack - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Director's Cut - Reroll Boss Blind for $10\n\nCurrent Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my jokers and strategy:\n- Splash is incredibly powerful - makes every card count in scoring\n- Merry Andy gives me tons of discards but reduces hand size to 6 (from 7 base, -1)\n- Zany Joker gives bonus for Three of a Kind\n- I've been playing Three of a Kind, Two Pair, and Pairs successfully\n\nThe Juggler would help offset the -1 hand size from Merry Andy, bringing me back to 7 cards playable. This could be very valuable since with Splash, every card played adds chips.\n\nJupiter would level up Flush, but I haven't been playing flushes much (only 1 time played).\n\nWith $11:\n- I could buy Juggler for $4, leaving $7\n- I could buy Jupiter for $3, leaving $8\n- I could reroll for $5, leaving $6\n\n\n- I could grab an Arcana or Standard pack for $4 each\n\nJuggler stands out as the strongest option here. Since Splash multiplies the value of every card I play, recovering that lost hand size from Merry Andy translates to roughly 16% more chips per hand. Rerolling could reveal better jokers, but my current lineup is already solid, and spending $5 leaves me with limited purchasing power afterward.\n\nThe safer play is buying Juggler outright. It directly amplifies my existing synergies and guarantees a meaningful improvement as I face tougher blinds ahead.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
