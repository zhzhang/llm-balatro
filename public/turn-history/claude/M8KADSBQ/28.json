{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small (800 chips needed)\n- Current Money: $3\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 6\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n2. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: Currently +2 Mult (was +3, now +2 because I just used a discard which decreased it by 1)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- I have a PAIR of 4s (4 of Hearts and 4 of Clubs)\n- Ranks: 8, 10, 4, Queen, 7, 4, Jack\n- Suits: Spades, Hearts, Hearts, Clubs, Clubs, Clubs, Diamonds\n\n**Best hand available:** Pair of 4s\n\n**Scoring calculation for Pair:**\n- Pair is Level 2: 25 base chips, 3 base mult\n- Green Joker: +2 mult\n- Splash: All played cards count\n- Total mult: 3 + 2 = 5 mult\n\nIf I play the pair of 4s plus 3 other high cards (Queen, Jack, 10):\n\n\n- Base chips: 25\n- Card chips (with Splash, all 5 cards count): 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 38 chips\n- Total chips: 25 + 38 = 63 chips\n- Mult: 5\n- Total score: 63 × 5 = 315 chips\n\nA single pair won't reach 800 chips, but across my 4 remaining hands I could accumulate around 1,260 chips if I consistently hit pairs. I need to explore whether other combinations might yield better results.\n\nWith 6 discards left, I could pursue a Three of a Kind to activate Zany Joker's +12 mult bonus, or aim for straights and stronger pairings. The issue is there's only one 4 remaining in the deck, making it unlikely I'll complete trips. Other pairs like Queens, Jacks, 10s, 8s, and 7s have better odds. I should play the current pair and reassess based on what I draw next. + chips as calculated before)\n- Risk: might not get it\n- Discards left: 6\n\nI have 6 discards remaining and only 4 hands total, so I should push for a stronger hand. The pair of 4s is solid, but a Three of a Kind would score significantly more. I'll discard the low cards (8, 7, and the pair of 4s) while keeping the Queen, Jack, and 10 to hunt for matching high cards.\n\nOn second thought, securing the pair now guarantees 315 chips and leaves me needing roughly 485 more across three remaining hands. That's a safer path than risking another discard for an uncertain upgrade.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,6,2,4,7]"}
