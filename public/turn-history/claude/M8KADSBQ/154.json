{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 9 of Spades (+9 chips, +4 Mult, Holo edition with +10 Mult, Mult enhancement, Retrigger 1 time)\n3. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler: +1 hand size\n6. Green Joker: Currently +0 Mult (after 2 discards, -2 Mult)\n\n**Situation:**\n- Need: 11,000 chips\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 5\n- Current chips: 0\n- Green Joker is currently at -2 Mult (after 2 discards)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have:\n- Three Jacks (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds) = Three of a Kind!\n- Two Kings (Spades, Clubs) = Pair\n- 10 of Diamonds\n- 9 of Spades (enhanced with Mult card and Holo edition)\n- 5 of Diamonds\n\nThe Three of a Kind of Jacks is excellent because:\n1. It triggers Zany Joker's +12 Mult\n2. With Splash, all 8 cards will count in scoring\n\n\n3. The Three of a Kind hand type provides 70 base chips and 7 base mult, and the 9 of Spades contributes significant multiplier value through its enhancements and retrigger effect, while the remaining cards add consistent chip values across the board. 20 Mult\n\nTotal mult: 7 + 12 - 2 + 8 + 20 = 45 Mult\n\nTotal chips: 144 × 45 = 6,480 chips\n\nThat falls short of the 11,000 target. I should explore using my remaining resources more strategically. With 3 hands and 5 discards left, activating Mystic Summit would add 15 Mult if I exhaust all my discards. However, this would push Green Joker to -7 Mult after 7 total discards, which cuts into the gains. I need to weigh whether the additional discard usage is worth the penalty.\n\nThe 9 of Spades deserves closer examination—it's a Mult card with Holo edition and a retrigger effect. When it scores, the enhancement grants +4 Mult, the Holo edition adds +10 Mult, and both trigger twice due to the retrigger, yielding +18 chips and +28 Mult total from that single card.\n\nRecalculating the full hand: 153 chips multiplied by 45 Mult gives 6,885 chips—still short of the 11,000 target. I need to find stronger cards through discarding. The 9 of Spades and the three Jacks forming the Three of a Kind are keepers, so I should focus on replacing the weaker cards in the hand.\n\nThe King of Spades, King of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds, and 5 of Diamonds are the most expendable, so I'll discard those four and draw fresh cards.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,4,7,8]"}
