{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades - +10 chips\n2. Ace of Hearts - +11 chips (Lucky Card: 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult)\n3. 2 of Hearts - +2 chips\n4. Ace of Clubs - +11 chips (Lucky Card: 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult)\n5. Ace of Diamonds - +11 chips\n6. King of Diamonds - +10 chips +4 Mult (Mult enhancement)\n7. 4 of Diamonds - +4 chips\n\n**Perfect! I now have THREE ACES!** This is exactly what I was trying to get through discarding.\n\n**Goal:** Need 2000 chips to beat Small Blind\n\n**Resources:**\n- 3 hands remaining\n- 3 discards remaining\n\n**Key Jokers:**\n- Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n- Misprint: Random mult bonus (~8 mult)\n\n**Available Hand:**\n- Three of a Kind (Three Aces!)\n- Two Pair (Aces + Kings)\n\nLet me calculate the scoring for Three of a Kind with all 7 cards:\n\n**Three of a Kind (Aces) with all 7 cards (Splash active):**\n\nBase chips for Three of a Kind (Level 2): 50 chips\nBase mult for Three of a Kind (Level 2): 5 mult\n\nChips from cards (all count due to Splash):\n- King of Spades: +10 chips\n- Ace of Hearts: +11 chips\n- 2 of Hearts: +2 chips\n- Ace of Clubs: +11 chips\n- Ace of Diamonds: +11 chips\n\n\n- King of Diamonds: +10 chips\n- 4 of Diamonds: +4 chips\n\nTotal chips: 50 + 10 + 11 + 2 + 11 + 11 + 10 + 4 = 109 chips\n\nMultiplier stacks from the Zany Joker's +12 for the three-of-a-kind, the King of Diamonds' +4 enhancement, and Misprint's estimated +8, giving me a base of 29 mult before considering the lucky card triggers.\n\nWithout any lucky activations, I'm looking at 109 × 29 = 3,161 chips. If one lucky trigger hits, that jumps to 5,341 chips, and two triggers would push it to 7,521 chips. Either way, I'm comfortably exceeding the 2,000 chip threshold, so I should play all 7 cards to leverage Splash's chip multiplication. The three Aces form the core of this hand.\n\nHowever, I realize I can only play 5 cards at a time due to Merry Andy reducing my hand size to 7. I need to pick the five highest-value cards: the King of Spades at 10 chips, both Aces at 11 chips each, and the two remaining cards with the best chip values.\n\nActually, I must include all three Aces to form the Three of a Kind scoring hand. That locks in three of my five slots. For the final two cards, the King of Diamonds offers both 10 chips and a 4x multiplier, making it essential. The King of Spades rounds out the selection with another 10 chips.\n\nSo my play is cards 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. The Three of a Kind base at Level 2 gives 50 chips, and I'm adding the individual card values on top of that.\n\nWith all five cards combined, I get 103 total chips. My multiplier stacks to 29x from the base 5, plus 12 from Zany Joker, 4 from the King of Diamonds, and roughly 8 from Misprint. That multiplies out to 2,987 chips—well past the 2,000 threshold. I still have two Lucky Cards that could trigger additional multipliers if I'm fortunate.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
