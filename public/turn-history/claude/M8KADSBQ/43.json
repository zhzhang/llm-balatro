{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 6\n- Boss Effect: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades - +10 chips\n2. 7 of Spades - +7 chips\n3. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\n4. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\n5. 4 of Clubs - +4 chips\n6. Jack of Diamonds - +10 chips\n7. 6 of Diamonds - +6 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +6 Mult (was +7, went down by 1 due to the discard)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of Jacks (Jack of Spades + Jack of Diamonds)\n- Pair of 9s (9 of Hearts + 9 of Clubs)\n- Two Pair (Jacks and 9s)\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe Two Pair is the strongest hand I can make. Let me calculate:\n- Two Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2\n- Cards that participate: Both Jacks (20 chips each from pair) and both 9s (18 chips each from pair) = 20 + 20 + 18 + 18 = 76 chips base\n\n\n- With Splash, all five cards contribute: the two Jacks and two 9s plus one additional card like the 7 of Spades adds 7 more chips, totaling 45 chips from individual cards plus the 20 base from Two Pair itself.\n\nThe multiplier comes from the Two Pair's base of 2, plus 6 from the Green Joker, giving 8 total. That yields 520 points—well short of the 1600 target. I need to activate Mystic Summit by using all my discards, which would add 15 multiplier. For now, I should discard the cards that don't fit the Two Pair pattern, keeping the Jacks and 9s intact.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,5,7]"}
