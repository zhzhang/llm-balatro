{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Current Chips: 840 out of 2000 needed\n- Need: 1160 more chips\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n4. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n7. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: Currently +0 Mult (goes up by 1 per play, down by 1 per discard)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size (so I can only play 5 cards)\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of Jacks (positions 2, 4)\n- High card (King)\n\n**Deck Info:**\n- 20 cards remaining\n- 2 more Jacks in deck (out of 20 cards)\n\nLet me calculate the options:\n\n**Option 1: Play the pair of Jacks with best supporting cards**\nWith Merry Andy limiting me to 5 cards, I need to select the Jacks plus the three highest-value cards.\n- Pair of Jacks (positions 2, 4)\n- Ace of Diamonds (position 6)\n- King of Spades (position 1)\n- 10 of Clubs (position 5)\n\nDue to Splash, all 5 cards count in scoring:\n\n\n- Base: 25 chips, 3 mult (Level 2 Pair)\n- Cards: Jack of Hearts (10), Jack of Clubs (10), Ace of Diamonds (11), King of Spades (10), 10 of Clubs (10)\n- Total chips: 25 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 10 + 10 = 76 chips\n- Mult: 3 (base) + 0 (Green Joker after the discard) = 3 mult\n- Total: 76 × 3 = 228 chips\n\nThis falls far short of the 1160 chips I need. I need to find a way to build significantly more multiplier, likely through the Zany Joker's Three of a Kind bonus or by preserving discards to activate Mystic Summit's +15 Mult at the end.\n\nWith 3 hands left, I'm looking at roughly 387 chips per hand to reach my goal. Discarding everything except the two Jacks gives me 5 new cards to draw from the remaining 20 cards. The odds of hitting at least one more Jack to form Three of a Kind are roughly 45%, which isn't ideal but might be my best shot at the multiplier boost I desperately need.\n\nActually, I only have 3 discards left, not 5. That changes things significantly—with just 3 new cards, my probability drops to about 28%. Even if I land the Three of a Kind with the Zany Joker and Green Joker multipliers, I need to verify whether that's enough to close the gap.\n\nIf the hand hits, I'd have 101 chips from the Three Jacks plus high cards, multiplied by 16 from my jokers, giving me 1616 chips. Combined with my current score, that reaches 2456—enough to win. But with only a 28% success rate and just 2 hands remaining after using this discard, it's a risky play.\n\nI should also consider whether I can build toward the Mystic Summit bonus by using all my remaining discards strategically. I need to sequence the discards carefully—using all three to reach 0 discards remaining, which activates Mystic Summit's bonus. But I should check what cards appear after each discard to decide if a different hand might work better. With 3 hands and 3 discards available, I'm exploring whether discarding once for a potential third Jack (giving me a Three of a Kind) would be more efficient than banking all discards to unlock Mystic Summit's multiplier boost. 304 + 380 = 912 chips, giving me 1752 total—248 short of 2000.\n\nI need either Three of a Kind or Mystic Summit to reach the goal. Three of a Kind is risky at 28.4% success rate, but Mystic Summit could deliver 1140 chips on the next hand, leaving only a small gap to close with my final two hands. The Mystic Summit path feels more reliable, so I'll use my remaining discards to trigger it.\n\nLet me work through the math more carefully. After three discards, Green Joker drops to -3 mult. When Mystic Summit activates at 0 discards, it grants +15 mult. Playing five cards with Splash, I'd get a pair (25 chips, 3 mult) plus five high cards averaging 10 chips each. That's 75 chips × (3 - 3 + 15) mult = 1125 chips, bringing me to 1965 total—still 35 short. This is uncomfortably close. Maybe I should risk one discard attempt at Three of a Kind instead, since the payoff would be massive if I hit the third Jack.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,5,6,7]"}
