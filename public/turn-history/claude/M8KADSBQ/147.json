{"reasoning":"I need to choose one of the 4 spectral cards from the Jumbo Spectral Pack:\n\n1. **Deja Vu** - Add a Red Seal to 1 selected card in hand (Retrigger this card 1 time)\n2. **Familiar** - Destroy 1 random card, add 3 random Enhanced face cards\n3. **Grim** - Destroy 1 random card, add 2 random Enhanced Aces\n4. **Ectoplasm** - Add Negative to a random Joker, -1 hand size (+1 Joker slot)\n\nLet me analyze my current situation:\n- I'm at Ante 5/8\n- My strongest hand is Three of a Kind (Level 3)\n- I have 6 jokers (at max capacity)\n- Current hand size is affected by: Merry Andy (-1), Juggler (+1) = normal 8 cards\n\nMy jokers:\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n6. Green Joker (Negative edition) - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard, +1 Joker slot\n\nCurrent hand:\n1. Ace of Clubs (Lucky Card - +11 chips, 1 in 5 for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 to win $20)\n2. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Clubs (Mult Card, Holo edition - +8 chips, +4 Mult, +10 Mult from holo)\n\n\n4. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n5. King of Diamonds (Mult Card - +10 chips, +4 Mult)\n6. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\nDeja Vu stands out as particularly valuable since retriggering my Holo 8 of Clubs would double its substantial chip and mult contribution. I could also apply it to the Lucky Ace for a chance at extra mult. The other options involve randomness that could backfire—destroying cards might remove my Lucky Ace, and Ectoplasm would shrink my hand size despite needing the full 8 cards for consistency. a random Joker, -1 hand size. A Negative edition grants an extra Joker slot, which would push me to 7 total jokers since I already have one from my Green Joker. The hand size penalty is problematic though—I'd drop to 7 cards, making it harder to complete hands when I'm already at baseline.\n\n**Deja Vu** stands out as the strongest option. The Red Seal lets me retrigger a high-value card with no drawbacks, and I'm leaning toward applying it to the 8 of Clubs since the Holo Mult synergy would compound significantly.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,3]"}
