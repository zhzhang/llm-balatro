{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 7,321\n- Remaining hands: 1\n- Remaining discards: 0\n- Money: $36\n\n**Chips needed to win:** 10,000 - 7,321 = 2,679 more chips with 1 hand remaining\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n2. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n3. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n6. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n7. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n8. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining (ACTIVE NOW since discards = 0)\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nI have 0 discards remaining, so Mystic Summit is active for +15 Mult!\n\nLooking at my hand, I need to identify the best possible hand:\n- THREE 7s: 7♠, 7♦, 7♦ - This is a Three of a Kind!\n- I could potentially make a Straight if I can find J-10-9-8-7, but I don't have an 8.\n\nLet me calculate the Three of a Kind:\n- Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n\n\n- Base mult: 5 (Level 2)\n\nPlaying the three 7s plus Jack and 10 of Clubs gives me: 7 + 7 + 7 + 10 + 10 = 41 chips from the cards themselves. With Splash counting all played cards, my total chips reach 91. The multiplier stacks to 32 from the base 5, plus 12 from Zany Joker triggering on the Three of a Kind, and 15 from Mystic Summit being active with no discards left.\n\nMultiplying 91 × 32 yields 2,912 chips. Combined with my previous score of 7,321, I reach 10,233 total—surpassing the 10,000 target. This Three of a Kind hand outperforms any Pair or High Card option available. I'll select positions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 to secure the win.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,6,7]"}
