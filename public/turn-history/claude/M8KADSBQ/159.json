{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Spades - +9 chips, +4 Mult (enhancement), +10 Mult (Holo edition), Retrigger 1 time\n2. 3 of Spades - +3 chips\n3. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips\n4. Jack of Hearts - +10 chips\n5. Ace of Clubs - +11 chips, Lucky Card (1 in 5 for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 for $20)\n6. Jack of Clubs - +10 chips\n7. Jack of Diamonds - +10 chips\n8. 9 of Diamonds - +9 chips\n\n**Hand Composition:**\n- Three Jacks (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds) = Three of a Kind\n- Two 9s (Spades, Diamonds) = Pair\n- Full House possible with Three Jacks + Two 9s\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining (ACTIVE NOW!)\n5. Juggler: +1 hand size\n6. Green Joker: -7 Mult (after 7 discards)\n\n**Situation:**\n- Need: 11,000 chips\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 0 (Mystic Summit is ACTIVE!)\n- Current chips: 0\n\nNow let me calculate what playing all 8 cards would give me:\n\n**Option 1: Play Full House (Three Jacks + Two 9s)**\nFull House (Level 2): Base chips 65, Base mult 6\n\nWith Splash, ALL 8 cards count for scoring:\n\n\nThe Full House gives 65 base chips, and since Splash makes every card contribute, I'm adding the individual card values: the 9 of Spades counts twice due to its retrigger (18 chips), plus 3, 10, 10, 11, 10, 10, and 9 from the other cards, totaling 146 chips before multipliers are applied.\n\nFor the multiplier, I start with 6 base, subtract 7 from Green Joker, add 15 from Mystic Summit, then get +8 from the 9 of Spades enhancement (doubled because it retriggered) and +20 from its Holo effect (also doubled), reaching 42 total multiplier. This gives 146 × 42 = 6,132 chips.\n\nNow looking at Three of a Kind with the three Jacks instead—that's 70 base chips with a 7 base multiplier, and Splash still applies to all 8 cards in hand.\n\nThe chip total comes from the base 70 plus the individual card values: the retriggered 9 of Spades adds 18, then the 3 of Spades, Queen of Hearts, both Jacks of Hearts and Clubs, Ace of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, and 9 of Diamonds each contribute their face values, summing to 151 chips. For multiplier, the base 7 gets boosted by Zany Joker's +12 for the Three of a Kind, reduced by Green Joker's -7, increased by Mystic Summit's +15, and the 9 of Spades adds its doubled enhancement and Holo bonuses.\n\nWith a final multiplier of 55, the score reaches 8,305 chips. Since I need 11,000 total, I'm short by 2,695 chips across my last two hands—roughly 1,348 per hand. Playing all 8 cards with Three of a Kind using the three Jacks should maximize the Splash effect and get me closer to the target.\n\nHowever, I'm realizing the play command caps out at 5 cards per hand. My hand size is 8 (Juggler and Merry Andy cancel each other out), so I can't play all my cards at once—I'll need to split them across multiple plays.\n\nFor this hand, I should prioritize the Three of a Kind with my three Jacks, then add the 9 of Spades (enhanced and retriggered for extra scoring) and the Ace of Clubs (which has Lucky Card potential). Playing these five cards together maximizes my score with the poker hand bonus plus the individual card multipliers.\n\nThe chip count comes to 129 total: 70 base plus 18 from the 9 of Spades, 10 each from the three Jacks, and 11 from the Ace. For multiplier, I'm looking at 55x base (combining Zany Joker's +12, Mystic Summit's +15, and the 9 of Spades' +28), with a chance to reach 75x if the Lucky Card triggers on the Ace.\n\nThis gives 7,095 chips normally, or 9,675 with the lucky proc—still falling short of the 11,000 target. I need to reconsider the hand composition. Including the 9 of Diamonds alongside the 9 of Spades would create a pair, which changes the card selection to positions 1, 4, 6, 7, 8. The new chip total becomes 127 with the same 55x multiplier, yielding 6,985 chips.\n\nThat's actually worse. Let me try a Full House instead—three Jacks and two 9s. The base chips drop to 122 (65 for the Full House plus individual card values), but the multiplier calculation with the Green Joker and Mystic Summit needs to be worked through to see if this configuration gets closer to the goal.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,6,7]"}
