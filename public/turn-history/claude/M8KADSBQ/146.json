{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $40\n- Max Jokers: 6 (have 6)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (have 1 - The Devil)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n6. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult), Negative edition\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card ($3 if held in hand at end of round)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Jumbo Spectral Pack - Choose 1 of up to 4 Spectral cards, Cost: $6\n2. Magic Trick voucher - Playing cards can be purchased from shop, Cost: $10\n\n**Hand Performance:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 - my strongest hand, scoring 2,912-4,324 chips\n- Straight: Level 2 - scoring 2,997-4,662 chips\n- At Ante 5/8, I need to continue scaling\n\n**Options:**\n1. Buy Jumbo Spectral Pack for $6 - Could get powerful effects like:\n   - Black Hole (upgrade all poker hands)\n   - Soul (create a legendary joker)\n   - Familiar (destroy 1 random card, add 3 random enhanced face cards)\n   - etc.\n2. Buy Magic Trick for $10 - Allows buying playing cards from shop\n\n\n3. Reroll shop for $5\n4. Just proceed to round_select\n\nThe Jumbo Spectral Pack is worth considering at $6 since spectral cards can dramatically shift my deck—Black Hole would upgrade all hands, Soul could generate a legendary joker. Magic Trick at $10 seems less critical right now since I'm already scaling well. I could also reroll the shop or just move forward to the next round.\n\nI'll grab the Jumbo Spectral Pack. The upside potential justifies the cost, and even a mediocre spectral card adds value at this stage of the run. Then I'll head to round_select.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
