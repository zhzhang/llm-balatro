{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the TAROT_PACK phase after buying an Arcana Pack\n- I have $4 left\n- I'm about to face the Boss Blind of Ante 3\n- My jokers are at max capacity (5/5)\n- I have 1/2 consumables (Pluto for High Card)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Judgement - Creates a random Joker card (Must have room)\n2. Temperance - Gives $10 (the total sell value of my current Jokers)\n3. The High Priestess - Creates up to 2 random Planet cards (Must have room)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nOption 1 (Judgement): I'm at max joker capacity (5/5), so I'd need to sell a joker first to make room. This could be risky if I get a bad joker.\n\nOption 2 (Temperance): This gives me $10, bringing my total to $14. This is cash that I could use to buy something better in the shop or save for future purchases.\n\nOption 3 (The High Priestess): Creates up to 2 random Planet cards. I have 1/2 consumable slots, so I can only hold 1 more consumable. This would give me 1-2 planet cards to level up hands. Looking at my hand levels:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2 (I use this often)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (I use this sometimes)\n- Pair: Level 2 (I use this often)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1 (just used this)\n- Full House: Level 1 (used once)\n- Flush: Level 2 (used once)\n- Straight: Level 2 (used twice)\n\nPlanet cards could be very useful to level up my commonly used hands, especially if I get planets for Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Full House, or Pair.\n\n\nThe Boss Blind ahead will demand significantly higher chip requirements than what I've been facing. My recent scores show Four of a Kind hitting 4,180 chips and Full House at 3,906, but Boss Blinds typically push toward 4,000-5,000+ at this ante. My Splash and Mystic Summit combo is solid, but leveling up my most-played hands through planet cards would directly boost my scoring ceiling for this critical round.\n\nThe High Priestess stands out because it upgrades the han types I rely on most—Three of a Kind, Pair, Four of a Kind—which compounds my scoring power. I'm also carrying Pluto unnecessarily, so I have room for another consumable. Temperance's $10 doesn't unlock anything I need right now; my current $4 plus that would only reach $14, which doesn't cover any meaningful shop purchases. Judgement is off the table since I'm at capacity and would have to sacrifice a joker to activate it.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
