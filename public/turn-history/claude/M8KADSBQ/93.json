{"reasoning":"Looking at the previous action failure: I tried to `buy_card 1` which failed with \"Cannot buy card at position 1\". \n\nThe Juggler is a joker card, not a playing card. Since I already have 5 jokers (at max capacity), I cannot buy another joker without selling one first.\n\nLet me reconsider my options:\n\n1. My joker slots are full (5/5):\n   - Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n   - Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n   - Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n   - Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n   - Misprint - Random mult bonus\n\n2. To buy Juggler, I need to sell a joker first\n\n3. Available options:\n   - Sell a joker and buy Juggler\n   - Buy Jupiter (planet card) for $3\n   - Buy a booster pack for $4\n   - Reroll shop for $5\n   - Just proceed to round_select\n\nLooking at which joker to potentially sell:\n- Merry Andy: Gives +3 discards but -1 hand size. If I buy Juggler (+1 hand size), these would cancel out and I'd just have +3 discards\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind - very valuable since I play this often\n- Splash: Incredibly powerful - makes every card count\n- Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining - situational but powerful\n- Misprint: Random mult - least consistent\n\nIf I sell Misprint (worth $2) and buy Juggler (costs $4), I'd spend net $2 and gain +1 hand size. This would give me 7 cards to play instead of 6, which with Splash is very valuable.\n\nAlternatively, selling Merry Andy and buying Juggler would give me back to normal hand size (7) but lose the +3 discards, which have been very useful.\n\n\nPairing Merry Andy with Juggler actually works well—the -1 hand size cancels out the +1, leaving me with normal hand size but gaining +3 discards per round to find better hands. I'll sell Misprint since it's the least reliable, then buy Juggler for a net cost of $2.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
