I could play any two of them\\n- Clubs flush potential: positions 3, 4, 5, 6 (King, 10, 7, 3 of Clubs) - that's 4 clubs\\n\\nLet me calculate what I could get from different hands:\\n\\nOption 1: Play pair of Aces (positions 1 and 7)\\n- Base chips for pair: 10\\n- Chips from the Aces: 11 + 11 = 22\\n- Total chips: 32\\n- Base mult for pair: 2\\n- Total score: 32 \\u00d7 2 = 64 chips\\n\\nOption 2: Play pair of 10s (positions 2 and 4)\\n- Base chips for pair: 10\\n- Chips from the 10s: 10 + 10 = 20\\n\\n\\n- Total chips: 30\\n- Base mult for pair: 2\\n- Total score: 30 \\u00d7 2 = 60 chips\\n\\nOption 3: Play two pair with Aces and 10s (positions 1, 2, 4, 7)\\n- Base chips for two pair: 20\\n- Chips from cards: 11 + 10 + 10 + 11 = 42\\n- Total chips: 62\\n- Base mult for two pair: 2\\n- Total score: 62 \\u00d7 2 = 124 chips\\n\\nOption 4: Play two pair with Aces and 3s (positions 1, 6, 7, 8) yields 44 chips \\u00d7 2 mult = 88 chips. Playing two pair with 10s and 3s (positions 2, 4, 6, 8) gives 26 chips \\u00d7 2 mult = 52 chips.\\n\\nThe strongest two pair option is Aces and 10s at 124 chips, which still seems underwhelming compared to what I might achieve with other hand types.\\n\\nTo reach 300 total, I'd need roughly 59 chips per hand across my remaining attempts. I have four clubs in hand, so pursuing a flush is worth exploring. A complete five-card clubs flush would score around 288 chips\\u2014nearly at my target\\u2014but depends on drawing that fifth club. Let me reconsider my approach more broadly. cards remaining: 40 cards\\n- Probability of drawing at least 1 club when drawing 4 cards is quite high with 9 clubs still in the deck.\\n\\nChasing the flush seems like the stronger play. If I hit it, that single hand gets me to 288 chips, leaving just 12 chips needed across my final 3 hands\\u2014a much more comfortable position than trying to grind out 59 chips per hand with the pair.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: King of Hearts.

Let me calculate what a clubs flush would give me:\\n\\nOption 1: Try to complete clubs flush by discarding non-clubs\\nIf I discard positions 1, 2, 3, 8 (King of Hearts, Jack of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds), I'd draw 4 new cards and hope one is a club.\\n- 9 clubs remaining in 36 cards\\n- Drawing 4 cards, probability of getting at least 1 club is quite high\\n\\nIf I complete a clubs flush with 5 clubs:\\n- Base chips for flush: 35\\n- Let's say I get King, 10, 7, 3 of Clubs plus one more club (average value ~7)\\n\\n\\n- Total would be around 72 chips with a 4x multiplier, giving me 288 chips\\u2014nearly enough to finish the blind in a single hand.\\n\\nOption 2: Play two pair with Kings and Jacks (positions 1, 2, 4, 8)\\n- Base chips for two pair: 20\\n- Chips from cards: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\\n- Total chips: 60\\n- Base mult for two pair: 2\\n- Total score: 120 chips\\n\\nThat's solid but I'd still need 180 more chips spread across the remaining hands.\\n\\nOption 3: Play the 4 clubs I have now for a flush (positions 4, 5, 6, 7)\\nWait, I need 5 cards to play a hand. Let me recalculate.\\n\\nIf I play positions 4, 5, 6, 7 (King, 10, 7, 3 of Clubs) plus one more card, I only have 4 clubs so it wouldn't be a flush.\\n\\nActually, I need to be more careful. I can only play UP TO 5 cards. With 4 clubs, I could:\\n- Play just the 4 clubs (4, 5, 6, 7) - but that's only 4 cards,\\n\\nwhich wouldn't form a flush (need 5)\\n- Add a fifth card that's not a club - then it's not a flush either\\n\\nSo I can't play a flush right now with only 4 clubs.\\n\\nLet me reconsider my options:\\n\\n1. Discard non-clubs (1, 2, 3, 8) to try to draw a 5th club for a flush\\n2. Play the two pair (Kings and Jacks) for 120 chips\\n\\nGiven that I have 4 hands remaining and only 2 discards, I think the flush chase is still the best strategy. If I hit it, I get ~288 chips in one hand. If I don't, I can fall back to playing pairs/two pairs with my remaining hands.\\n\\nLet me go with discarding the non-clubs to chase the flush.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 5]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 10 of Spades.

Let me verify this follows the scoring rules correctly: since all five cards form the flush, every card's chip value contributes to the total.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current game state:\n\nCurrent Hand:\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n3. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n4. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n5. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\nCurrent chips: 280\nChips needed: 300\nRemaining chips needed: 20\n\nRemaining hands: 3\nRemaining discards: 1\n\nLet me look for possible hands:\n- No pairs visible\n- Two Spades: 10 and 7\n- Two Hearts: 4 and 3\n- Two Clubs: Jack and 2\n- Two Diamonds: 9 and 8\n\nI need just 20 more chips to win. Let me calculate what I can do:\n\nOption 1: Play high card with highest value card (10 of Spades or Jack of Clubs)\n- Base chips for high card: 5\n- Chips from card: 10\n- Total chips: 15\n- Base mult: 1\n- Total score: 15 × 1 = 15 chips\nNot enough!\n\nOption 2: Play two cards as high card\nActually, if I play multiple cards, they need to form a hand. Let me think about what hands I can make:\n\nCan I make a straight?\nCards: 10, 7, 4, 3, J (11), 2, 9, 8\nFor a straight, I need 5 consecutive ranks.\n- I have: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack\n- Possible straights: \n  - 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack (positions 2, 8, 7, 1, 5)\n  - The suits don't match for a flush, but these five cards do form a valid straight.\n\nA straight with 7, 8, 9, 10, and Jack gives me 30 base chips plus 44 from the card values, multiplied by 4 for the hand type. That totals 296 chips—just enough to reach my goal.\n\nSince I already have 280 chips and only need 20 more to hit 300, this straight would actually overshoot the target significantly. I should consider whether a simpler play might work instead, like just playing two high cards for a basic pair or high card hand.\n\nPlaying just the 10 and Jack gives me only 15 chips total—not enough. Even adding a third card like the 9 doesn't help, still landing at 15 chips. I'm realizing I may have misunderstood how the chip scoring works. The rules state that card chip values are only counted when those specific cards are played, which means I need to reconsider my calculation approach.\n\nLooking back at the pair example: when two kings with +10 mult are played together, they each contribute their chips because both are part of the hand. For a high card hand though, only the single highest card would contribute beyond the base chips. But if those same cards form a different hand—like a straight—then all five cards would be part of that hand and could all contribute their chip values.\n\nLet me recalculate assuming the five cards form a straight: the 7, 8, 9, 10, and Jack would each add their respective chip values (7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 10 = 44) to the base 30 chips, giving 74 total chips. Multiplied by the straight's 4x multiplier, that's 296 chips, which would bring my running total to 576.\n\nThat's well above what I need. Playing this straight is the clear choice—it wins decisively without any unnecessary risk."
