{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $46\n- Max Jokers: 6 (currently have 6 jokers)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 1)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n6. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult), Negative edition (+1 Joker slot)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card, Cost: $3\n2. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards, Cost: $4\n3. Jumbo Spectral Pack - Choose 1 of up to 4 Spectral cards, Cost: $6\n4. Magic Trick voucher - Playing cards can be purchased from shop, Cost: $10\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n\n**Hand Level Analysis:**\nLooking at my most played hands:\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, played 5 times - This is my most successful hand type\n- Straight: Level 2, played 4 times\n- Pair: Level 2, played 5 times\n- Two Pair: Level 1, played 4 times\n- Full House: Level 2, played 1 time\n- Flush: Level 2, played 1 time\n\n\n- High Card: Level 1, played 1 time\n\nSince chip requirements scale up significantly at this ante, I need to focus on strengthening my most reliable hands. Three of a Kind is clearly my strongest performer and synergizes perfectly with Zany Joker's +12 Mult bonus. The Celestial Pack at $4 would let me grab a planet card to level up either Three of a Kind or Straight, both of which have proven effective. The Devil could also be useful for converting a card to Gold, though the planet upgrade seems more impactful for scaling.\n\nI have $46 available, so the Celestial Pack is easily affordable and gives me the most direct scoring boost heading into tougher antes.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
