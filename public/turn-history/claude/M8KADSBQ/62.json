Let me calculate what I can score with different hands:\\n\\n**Option 1: Play pair of 9s with all cards using Splash**\\n- Base: 25 chips, 3 mult (Level 2 Pair)\\n- Cards with Splash (all 7 count):\\n  - 9 of Spades: +9\\n  - 6 of Spades: +6\\n  - 4 of Hearts: +4\\n  - King of Clubs: +10\\n  - 9 of Clubs: +9\\n  - 2 of Clubs: +2\\n  - 4 of Diamonds: +4\\n- Total chips: 25 + 9 + 6 + 4 + 10 + 9 + 2 + 4 = 69 chips\\n- Mult: 3 (base) + 1 (Green Joker) = 4 mult\\n- Total: 69 \\u00d7 4 = 276 chips\\n\\n**Option 2: Play pair of 4s with all cards using Splash**\\nSame calculation as above: 276 chips\\n\\n**Option 3: Try to get a better hand by discarding**\\nI could discard to try to find:\\n- Another 9 or 4 for three of a kind (+12 mult from Zany Joker)\\n- Better cards overall\\n\\nLet me think about the Three of a Kind option:\\n- There are 2 more 9s in deck (out of 30 cards)\\n- There are 2 more 4s in deck (out of 30 cards)\\n\\nIf I get Three of a Kind:\\n- Base: 50 chips, 5 mult (Level 2)\\n- With Zany Joker: +12 mult\\n- With Green Joker after a discard: 0 mult\\n- Cards with Splash (assuming I play all 7):\\n  - Three 9s: \\n\\n27 chips\\n  - Plus other cards: let's say ~20 more chips\\n- Total chips: ~97 chips\\n- Mult: 5 + 12 + 0 = 17 mult\\n- Total: ~1649 chips\\n\\nThis would be enough to win! But I need to find that third 9 or 4. Let me reconsider the math\\u2014I need 1160 more chips across 3 hands, averaging about 387 per hand. My current pair strategy yields roughly 828 chips total, leaving me about 668 chips short. I should keep the pair of 9s and discard the rest to hunt for that third matching card.\\n\\nActually, I need to be more precise about my hand composition. With Merry Andy reducing my hand size by 1, I can only play 5 cards. Looking at my best options: the 9 of Spades, King of Clubs, 9 of Clubs, 6 of Spades, and 4 of Hearts give me a base of 25 chips with 3 mult, plus the individual card values totaling 38 additional chips.\\n\\nThat puts me at 63 chips \\u00d7 4 mult = 252 total, which falls short of what I need. Three of a Kind would be significantly stronger, so I should discard everything except the pair of 9s and hope to draw another 9 to complete the set.\\nCommand: discard 2 3 6 7 4\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 61]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 7\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Green Joker.

The Jacks form the base, and I should add the highest-value cards to maximize Splash's contribution.\\n\\nChoosing the Jacks at positions 4 and 5, plus the 10 of Spades, 9 of Spades, and 8 of Diamonds gives me 72 chips from the hand plus 25 from the pair itself. With 3 multiplier from the Level 2 Pair and no additional multiplier bonuses, this yields 216 chips total\\u2014a significant improvement.\\n\\n**Option 3: Play Pair of 9s with best supporting cards**\\nThe 9s at positions 2 and 6 form another potential base, with the Jack of Hearts as a supporting card.\\n\\nSwapping in the Jack of Clubs and 10 of Spades instead gives me 48 chips from the five cards plus 25 from the pair, totaling 73 chips. Multiplied by 3, this reaches 219 chips\\u2014slightly better than the previous option.\\n\\n**Option 4: Try to get Three of a Kind**\\nThe deck still has 2 additional 9s and 2 additional Jacks remaining out of 25 cards. If I manage to draw a third Jack, I'd unlock a Three of a Kind hand with 50 chips base and 5 multiplier.\\n\\nWith Zany Joker adding 12 mult and Green Joker subtracting 1 after another discard, plus Splash counting all five cards (three Jacks at 30 chips, the 10 of Spades at 10, and 9 of Spades at 9), I'd reach 99 total chips. That's 16 multiplier overall, giving me 1,584 chips\\u2014enough to win since I'd have 2,424 total. Getting three 9s instead follows a similar path with comparable results. rest. I need to evaluate the risk-reward here. With 4 discards and 3 hands left, I'm looking at roughly a 54% chance of drawing another Jack or 9 from the remaining 25 cards across my available draws. The pair of Jacks seems like the safer anchor since they're already contributing solid value, so I'll discard everything else and hope to hit a third Jack or 9.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 6 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 62]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 7\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Green Joker.

Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\\n\\n**Possible Hands:**\\n- Pair of Jacks (positions 2, 4)\\n- High card (King)\\n\\n**Deck Info:**\\n- 20 cards remaining\\n- 2 more Jacks in deck (out of 20 cards)\\n\\nLet me calculate the options:\\n\\n**Option 1: Play the pair of Jacks with best supporting cards**\\nWith Merry Andy limiting me to 5 cards, I need to select the Jacks plus the three highest-value cards.\\n- Pair of Jacks (positions 2, 4)\\n- Ace of Diamonds (position 6)\\n- King of Spades (position 1)\\n- 10 of Clubs (position 5)\\n\\nDue to Splash, all 5 cards count in scoring:\\n\\n\\n- Base: 25 chips, 3 mult (Level 2 Pair)\\n- Cards: Jack of Hearts (10), Jack of Clubs (10), Ace of Diamonds (11), King of Spades (10), 10 of Clubs (10)\\n- Total chips: 25 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 10 + 10 = 76 chips\\n- Mult: 3 (base) + 0 (Green Joker after the discard) = 3 mult\\n- Total: 76 \\u00d7 3 = 228 chips\\n\\nThis falls far short of the 1160 chips I need. I need to find a way to build significantly more multiplier, likely through the Zany Joker's Three of a Kind bonus or by preserving discards to activate Mystic Summit's +15 Mult at the end.\\n\\nWith 3 hands left, I'm looking at roughly 387 chips per hand to reach my goal. Discarding everything except the two Jacks gives me 5 new cards to draw from the remaining 20 cards. The odds of hitting at least one more Jack to form Three of a Kind are roughly 45%, which isn't ideal but might be my best shot at the multiplier boost I desperately need.\\n\\nActually, I only have 3 discards left, not 5. That changes things significantly\\u2014with just 3 new cards, my probability drops to about 28%. Even if I land the Three of a Kind with the Zany Joker and Green Joker multipliers, I need to verify whether that's enough to close the gap.\\n\\nIf the hand hits, I'd have 101 chips from the Three Jacks plus high cards, multiplied by 16 from my jokers, giving me 1616 chips. Combined with my current score, that reaches 2456\\u2014enough to win. But with only a 28% success rate and just 2 hands remaining after using this discard, it's a risky play.\\n\\nI should also consider whether I can build toward the Mystic Summit bonus by using all my remaining discards strategically. I need to sequence the discards carefully\\u2014using all three to reach 0 discards remaining, which activates Mystic Summit's bonus. But I should check what cards appear after each discard to decide if a different hand might work better. With 3 hands and 3 discards available, I'm exploring whether discarding once for a potential third Jack (giving me a Three of a Kind) would be more efficient than banking all discards to unlock Mystic Summit's multiplier boost. 304 + 380 = 912 chips, giving me 1752 total\\u2014248 short of 2000.\\n\\nI need either Three of a Kind or Mystic Summit to reach the goal. Three of a Kind is risky at 28.4% success rate, but Mystic Summit could deliver 1140 chips on the next hand, leaving only a small gap to close with my final two hands. The Mystic Summit path feels more reliable, so I'll use my remaining discards to trigger it.\\n\\nLet me work through the math more carefully. After three discards, Green Joker drops to -3 mult. When Mystic Summit activates at 0 discards, it grants +15 mult. Playing five cards with Splash, I'd get a pair (25 chips, 3 mult) plus five high cards averaging 10 chips each. That's 75 chips \\u00d7 (3 - 3 + 15) mult = 1125 chips, bringing me to 1965 total\\u2014still 35 short. This is uncomfortably close. Maybe I should risk one discard attempt at Three of a Kind instead, since the payoff would be massive if I hit the third Jack.\\nCommand: discard 1 3 5 6 7\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 7\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Green Joker.
