{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Current Chips: 840 out of 2000 needed\n- Need: 1160 more chips\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n2. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: Currently +0 Mult (goes up by 1 per play, down by 1 per discard)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size (so I can only play 5 cards)\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Three of a Kind with Jacks (positions 2, 5, 7)! This is huge!\n- Two Pair (Jacks at 2, 5, 7 and 4s at 1, 6)\n- Pair of 4s (positions 1, 6)\n\nI hit the Three of a Kind! This is exactly what I was hoping for. Let me calculate what this hand will score:\n\n**Three of a Kind (Jacks) calculation:**\nWith Merry Andy, I can only play 5 cards, but I have THREE JACKS! I need to select:\n- All 3 Jacks (positions 2, 5, 7)\n- The 2 highest remaining cards: Ace of Clubs (11) and Queen of Clubs (10)\n\n\n- Since Splash makes all played cards count, my chip total is 50 base plus 10 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 10 from the five cards, giving me 101 chips. The base multiplier starts at 5, with the Green Joker currently at +0.\n\nThe Zany Joker adds +12 for the Three of a Kind, bringing my multiplier to 17. That gives me 101 × 17 = 1,717 chips from this hand. Combined with my existing 840 chips, I reach 2,557 total—well above the 2,000 chip threshold needed to beat the blind.\n\nI need to play the Jack of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, and Jack of Diamonds to achieve this score.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,7]"}
