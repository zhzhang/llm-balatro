{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 10 (about to face Boss Blind)\n- Money: $4\n- Jokers (5/5): Merry Andy, Zany Joker, Splash, Mystic Summit, Juggler\n- Consumables (2/2): Pluto (High Card level up), Earth (Full House level up)\n- Hieroglyph voucher (-1 Ante, -1 hand each round)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Madness - $7 (X0.5 mult, destroys random joker) - Too expensive and bad\n2. Sly Joker - $3 (+50 chips for Pair)\n3. Standard Pack - $4\n4. Director's Cut - $10 (Too expensive)\n5. Reroll - $5 (More than I have)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm about to face the Boss Blind of Ante 3. Looking at my recent scores:\n- Four of a Kind: 4,180 chips\n- Full House: 3,906 chips\n\nBoss Blinds at Ante 3 typically require 4,000-5,000+ chips, so I need to make sure I'm prepared.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. I have Earth planet card which can level up Full House from Level 1 (40 chips, 4 mult) to Level 2 (likely 65 chips, 6 mult)\n2. I have Pluto but High Card is not useful to me\n3. My core strategy relies on Splash + Mystic Summit\n4. I just played a Full House for 3,906 chips at Level 1\n\n**Options:**\n1. Use Earth to level up Full House - This would boost Full House significantly\n2. Sell Pluto ($1) to get $5, then buy something\n3. Buy Sly Joker for $3 (would need to sell a joker first since I'm at 5/5)\n\n\n4. Buy Standard Pack for $4\n5. Go straight to round select\n\n**Best Action:**\n\nUsing Earth on Full House makes the most sense. Since Full House just scored 3,906 chips at Level 1, upgrading it to Level 2 would increase the base chips to around 65 and mult to 6, giving me a much stronger hand for the Boss Blind. This is a reliable scoring hand I can frequently make, so the investment pays off immediately.\n\nThe command format for planet cards is straightforward since they don't need target cards—just `use_consumable 2` since Earth is in position 2. Before committing though, I'm weighing whether selling Juggler for $2 to reach $6 total would be better, allowing me to grab Sly Joker for $3 instead, but the direct Full House upgrade seems more impactful for my current situation.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
