{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8 (reduced from 3/8 by Hieroglyph)\n- Round: 7 (just finished Small Blind)\n- Current Money: $3\n- In SHOP phase\n- I have 4/5 joker slots filled (just sold Green Joker)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size - Sells for $3\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind - Sells for $2\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring - Sells for $1\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining - Sells for $2\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- The Magician (Tarot): Enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards - $3\n- Lusty Joker: +3 Mult per Heart card scored - $5\n- Standard Pack x2: $4 each\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have exactly $3, which is enough to buy The Magician. Based on my previous reasoning, this was the plan - sell Green Joker for $2, bringing me to $3, then buy The Magician.\n\nThe Magician allows me to enhance 2 selected cards to Lucky Cards, which give:\n- 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult\n- 1 in 15 chance to win $20\n\nSince I've been playing Pairs and Three of a Kind successfully (looking at my last played hands), enhancing high-value cards that I frequently play would be beneficial. Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) and Aces are good targets since they appear in my winning hands.\n\nMy strategy has been:\n- Three of a Kind (Level 2): Base 50 chips, 5 mult - played 3 times\n\n\n- Pair (Level 2): Base 25 chips, 3 mult - played 5 times\n\nWith Zany Joker boosting Three of a Kind hands and Splash amplifying all played cards, adding Lucky Cards to frequently-used cards could unlock significant value through the +20 Mult trigger. The Magician seems like the right move here—I can't afford the reroll, and skipping consumables entirely leaves me vulnerable as the blinds scale up. or if I need to wait. The buy_and_use_consumable command won't work since The Magician requires selecting specific cards to enhance. I'll purchase it with buy_card instead and use it later when I have cards in hand. The Magician is the first shop card, so I'll target position 1.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
