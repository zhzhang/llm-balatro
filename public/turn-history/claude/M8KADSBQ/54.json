{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n2. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n3. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n4. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n5. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n6. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of 7s (positions 1, 4)\n- Pair of 3s (positions 2, 6)\n- Pair of 9s (positions 3, 7)\n- Two Pair (7s and 3s, or 7s and 9s, or 3s and 9s)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +1 Mult (currently at +1, increases with each hand played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Goal:** Need 2,000 chips to pass Small Blind\n\n**Resources:**\n- 4 hands remaining\n- 7 discards remaining\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy best hand types are:\n- Three of a Kind (Level 2): 50 base chips, 5 base mult, +12 mult from Zany Joker\n- Pair (Level 2): 25 base chips, 3 base mult\n\nI don't have a Three of a Kind in this hand. I should discard to try to find one, since I have plenty of discards (7) and hands (4).\n\nLet me think about what to discard. I want to keep pairs to have better chances of making three of a kind. \n\nSince I have three different pairs available, I should focus on one and discard the others. The 9s are my highest-value pair, so keeping those gives me the best shot at drawing a matching card. I'll discard the 7s, 3s, and 6 to maximize my chances of completing a three of a kind with the 9s. and keep the pair of 9s at positions 3 and 7. With two 9s already in hand and two remaining in the deck, there's a reasonable shot at completing three of a kind on the draw.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,6]"}
