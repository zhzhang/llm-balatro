{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $34\n- I have The Devil consumable that I want to use to enhance a card into a Gold Card\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind** - 11,000 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Skip tag: Charm Tag (Free Mega Arcana Pack)\n2. **Big Blind** - 16,500 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip tag: Boss Tag (Rerolls the Boss Blind)\n3. **Boss Blind** - 22,000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss Description: All Club cards are debuffed\n\n**Key Issue: Boss Blind Effect**\nThe Boss blind debuffs all Club cards. Looking at my previous game states, I had these cards:\n- Ace of Clubs (Lucky Card)\n- 10 of Clubs\n- 8 of Clubs (Mult Card, Holo edition, now with Red Seal from Deja Vu)\n- 7 of Clubs\n\nThe 8 of Clubs is one of my strongest cards with:\n- Mult enhancement (+4 Mult)\n- Holo edition (+10 Mult)\n- Red Seal (retrigger once)\n\nIf all Club cards are debuffed in the Boss blind, this will severely hurt my scoring power.\n\n**Analysis of Skipping:**\n- Skipping Small gives Charm Tag (Free Mega Arcana Pack) - Could be useful for tarot cards\n- Skipping Big gives Boss Tag (Rerolls the Boss Blind) - This is VERY valuable! It would let me reroll away the \"All Club cards debuffed\" effect\n\n**Strategy Consideration:**\nGiven that the Boss blind debuffs all my Club cards including my powerful enhanced 8 of Clubs, I should consider:\n\n\nPlaying the Small Blind to secure chips, then skipping the Big Blind to get the Boss Tag. This tag would let me reroll the Boss Blind for a better effect instead of facing the Club debuff. My Diamond cards like the King of Diamonds can contribute, but debuffed cards lose their chips and effects entirely, which is too risky. The Boss Tag is valuable enough to justify skipping the Big Blind.","action":"\"play_round\""}
