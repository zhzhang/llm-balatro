{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Just completed the Small Blind (300 chips needed) with 576 chips total\n- Currently in the SHOP phase\n- Money: $9\n- Ante: 1/8, Round 1\n- No jokers or consumables currently owned\n- Max jokers: 5, Max consumables: 2\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\n1. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0). Cost: $4\n2. Greedy Joker - Played Diamond cards give +3 Mult when scored. Cost: $5\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of 2 jokers. Cost: $4\n2. Mega Spectral Pack - Choose 2 of 4 spectral cards. Cost: $8\n\n**Vouchers:**\n1. Telescope - Celestial Packs always contain Planet card for most played hand. Cost: $10\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 1, played 1 time\n- Straight: Level 1, played 1 time\n- All others: Level 1, never played\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith $9, my options are:\n1. Buy Green Joker ($4) - leaves $5\n2. Buy Greedy Joker ($5) - leaves $4\n3. Buy Buffoon Pack ($4) - leaves $5\n4. Buy Mega Spectral Pack ($8) - leaves $1\n5. Reroll shop ($5) - leaves $4\n6. Save money and proceed to next round\n\n**Evaluating Jokers:**\n\n**Green Joker ($4):** \n- Starts at +0 Mult\n- Gains +1 Mult per hand played\n- Loses -1 Mult per discard\n- This is a scaling joker that gets better over time\n\n\n- Strong long-term value if I play efficiently and avoid excessive discards—last round I played 2 hands with only 1 discard, which would've given me +1 Mult\n\n**Greedy Joker ($5):**\n- Only triggers on Diamond cards that score\n- Requires building a Diamond-focused strategy to be effective\n- Less reliable than the Green Joker's consistent scaling\n\n**Buffoon Pack ($4):**\n- Offers a chance to discover a joker beyond what's currently available\n- Gamble that could pay off with a stronger option\n\n**Spectral cards** from the Mega Spectral Pack have potential but the cost leaves minimal funds for future purchases.\n\nSince I'm early in the run (Ante 1, just finished Small Blind), I need a foundation that scales. Green Joker does this naturally—it's affordable, multiplies throughout the entire run, and rewards efficient play. Greedy Joker demands a specific deck composition around Diamonds, making it harder to pivot. The Spectral Pack is tempting but too expensive at this stage when I should be building core synergies.\n\nI'll grab Green Joker for $4, leaving me with $5 for future shops. This gives me a reliable scaling engine without overcommitting resources early.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
