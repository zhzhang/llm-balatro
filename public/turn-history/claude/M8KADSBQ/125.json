{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current tarot pack options:\n\n1. **The Devil** - Enhances 1 card to Gold Card ($3 if held at end of round)\n2. **Strength** - Increases rank of up to 2 cards by 1\n3. **Death** - Convert one card into another\n4. **The Wheel of Fortune** - 1 in 4 chance to add edition to a random Joker (Foil +50 chips, Holographic +10 Mult, or Polychrome x1.5 Mult)\n5. **Judgement** - Creates a random Joker (must have room)\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I'm at max jokers (5/5)\n- I have 1 consumable slot available (1/2)\n- My strategy relies on Splash (all cards count) + Mystic Summit (+15 mult at 0 discards)\n- I'm entering Ante 4 which will be significantly harder\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**The Devil**: Gold Cards give $3 at end of round. This is a passive income generator, but not a strong scaling option for chip generation. Given I'm entering Ante 4, I need more chip scaling than money.\n\n**Strength**: Increases rank of 2 cards by 1. This could turn 10s into Jacks, Jacks into Queens, etc. With Splash active, every card's chip value matters. Increasing ranks means more chip value. For example, turning a 2 into a 3 (+1 chip), or an Ace could become... wait, Aces are already the highest rank. This could be useful for strengthening my deck over time. However, the benefit is marginal (+1-2 chips per card isn't huge).\n\n**Death**: Convert one card into another. This is very flexible - I could duplicate high-value cards or create pairs/sets. With Splash, having more high-value cards means more chips. This could be powerful for creating specific hands.\n\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune offers a 25% shot at permanently buffing a random joker with an edition—Foil adds 50 chips, Holographic gives 10 Mult, or Polychrome multiplies Mult by 1.5. Polychrome would synergize beautifully with my current setup, and even Holographic is valuable. The randomness is a drawback, but the upside is significant.\n\nJudgement creates a random joker, but I'm already at capacity with 5 jokers, so I'd need to sacrifice an existing one first, which defeats the purpose.\n\nLooking ahead to Ante 4, the blind requirements will jump substantially—likely needing 5,000+ chips minimum, 8,000+ for the big blind, and 12,000+ for the boss. My current approach only generated 4,662 chips against the boss, so I need stronger scaling. The Wheel of Fortune is my best bet since multiplicative boosts from editions would compound with my existing Mystic Summit and hand multiplier setup.\n\nDeath could theoretically duplicate high-value cards or convert weak ones, but I don't have Lucky Cards in my current hand to leverage. Strength's modest chip gains won't bridge the gap I'm facing. The Wheel's 25% success rate is worth the risk given the potential payoff—a Polychrome edition alone would multiply my scoring significantly, and even a failed attempt doesn't set me back much since I've already committed to the pack.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
