{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n4. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n5. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- I have FOUR QUEENS! (Q♠, Q♥, Q♣, Q♦)\n- I have 4 Spades (A♠, Q♠, 5♠, 2♠) - need one more for flush\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 3\n- Need: 3000 chips total\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n1. Four of a Kind (Queens) - This is HUGE!\n2. Three of a Kind (Queens) - Also triggers Zany Joker\n\nLet me calculate the score for Four of a Kind:\n\n**Four of a Kind (Queens):**\n- Base: 60 chips, 7 mult (Level 1)\n- Does Zany Joker trigger? Yes! Four of a kind CONTAINS three of a kind, so +12 mult → 19 mult\n- All 8 cards contribute via Splash:\n  - A♠: +11, Q♠: +10, 5♠: +5, 2♠: +2, Q♥: +10, Q♣: +10, Q♦: +10, 2♦: +2\n  - Total from cards: 60 chips\n- Score WITHOUT Mystic Summit: 120 × 19 = 2,280 chips\n- Score WITH Mystic Summit (if I use all 3 discards): 120 × 34 = 4,080 chips\n\nPlaying Four of a Kind and burning through my remaining discards activates Mystic Summit's bonus, pushing me well past the 3,000 chip threshold in a single hand. I should commit all three discards to this play.\n\nTo maximize the hand, I'll discard the non-Queen cards—specifically the Ace of Spades, 5 of Spades, and 2 of Spades—leaving the four Queens intact for the scoring combination.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,4]"}
