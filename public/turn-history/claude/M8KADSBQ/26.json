{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (BLIND_SELECT phase)\n- Current Money: $3\n- I need to decide whether to play or skip the Small Blind\n\n**Small Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Reward: $3\n- Tag if skipped: Voucher Tag (adds one voucher to next shop)\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips, $4 reward, Holographic Tag if skipped\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips, $5 reward, Boss effect: \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +3 Mult (increases per hand played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 2, 25 chips, 3 mult\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1, 30 chips, 3 mult\n- Straight: Level 1, 30 chips, 4 mult\n- Two Pair: Level 1, 20 chips, 2 mult\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me estimate what I can score with my current setup:\n\n**Three of a Kind scoring:**\n- Base: 30 chips + 3 mult\n- With Green Joker: +3 mult\n- With Zany Joker: +12 mult\n- With Splash: All played cards count\n- Total mult before cards: 3 + 3 + 12 = 18 mult\n\nIf I play a Three of a Kind with, say, three 10s and two other cards (since Splash makes all cards count):\n- Chips: 30 (base) + 10*5 = 80 chips (all 5 cards count with Splash)\n\n\n- Mult: 18\n- Total: 80 * 18 = 1,440 chips\n\nThis comfortably clears the 800-chip Small Blind requirement. Now I'm weighing whether to skip for the Voucher Tag instead. A free voucher in the next shop could be valuable, but I'd forfeit the $3 reward and still face the Big Blind and Boss Blind afterward. With only $3 currently, that extra money might be more immediately useful than a future voucher.\n\nThe Boss Blind's \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\" effect will complicate strategy, yet I should still manage the 800-chip threshold without difficulty. I'll go ahead and play the Small Blind—the immediate cash reward pushes me closer to $6, which opens up better shop options, and I need the experience facing these escalating challenges before tackling the harder blinds ahead.","action":"\"play_round\""}
