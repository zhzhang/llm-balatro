{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the STANDARD_PACK phase after buying a Standard Pack\n- I have $0 money left\n- I'm about to face the Boss Blind of Ante 3\n- I have 5/5 jokers and 1/2 consumables\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. 4 of Diamonds - Basic card, +4 chips\n2. 7 of Spades - Wild Card enhancement (+7 chips, can be used as any suit)\n3. 9 of Spades - Mult enhancement AND Holo edition (+9 chips, +4 Mult from enhancement, +10 Mult from Holo, retrigger 1 time)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nOption 3 (9 of Spades) is clearly the best choice here. Let me break down why:\n\nThe 9 of Spades has:\n- Mult Card enhancement: +4 Mult when scored\n- Holographic edition: +10 Mult and retriggers once\n- Base: +9 chips\n\nWhen this card is played and scored, it will:\n1. First trigger: +9 chips, +4 mult (enhancement), +10 mult (holo) = +9 chips, +14 mult\n2. Retrigger: Another +9 chips, +4 mult, +10 mult = +9 chips, +14 mult\nTotal contribution: +18 chips, +28 mult per play\n\nThis is incredibly powerful, especially with my Splash joker that makes every played card count in scoring! This card would trigger even if it's not part of the primary hand, and with the retrigger from the Holo edition, it would contribute significantly to every hand I play.\n\nThe Wild Card (option 2) is nice for flexibility in making flushes/straights, but the raw power of the Mult+Holo 9 of Spades is much more valuable, especially since I don't have a flush or straight focused strategy right now.\n\n\nThe 4 of Diamonds is just a basic card with no enhancements, so it's clearly inferior. I'm going with the 9 of Spades.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
