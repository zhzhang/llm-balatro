{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 10\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Boss Blind: \"First hand is drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Reward: $5\n- Money: $0\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers (5/5): Merry Andy (+3 discards, -1 hand size), Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind), Splash (every played card counts), Mystic Summit (+15 Mult at 0 discards), Juggler (+1 hand size)\n- Consumables (1/2): Pluto (High Card level up)\n- Vouchers: Hieroglyph (-1 Ante, -1 hand each round)\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Four of a Kind - 4,180 chips (Big Blind)\n- Full House - 3,906 chips (Small Blind at Level 1, now Level 2)\n- I just added a 9 of Spades with Mult enhancement + Holo edition (very powerful card)\n\n**Boss Blind Analysis:**\nThe boss effect is \"First hand is drawn face down\" - this means I won't be able to see my first hand of cards, making it difficult to plan which cards to play or discard initially. However, this is a relatively mild boss effect compared to others.\n\n**Available Commands:**\n- play_round - Start the boss round\n- use_consumable - Use Pluto on a card\n- sell_consumable - Sell Pluto for $1\n- rearrange_jokers - Change joker order\n- sell_joker - Sell a joker\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Should I use Pluto?** - Pluto levels up High Card, which I never play (0 times played). This would be a waste. I should not use it.\n\n\n2. **Should I sell Pluto?** - Selling it would give me $1, but there's nothing I can do with $1 during the BLIND_SELECT phase. I'm not in a shop. So selling it now would be pointless.\n3. **Should I rearrange jokers?** - Joker order matters for activation. Currently I have Merry Andy, Zany Joker, Splash, Mystic Summit, Juggler. Since most effects trigger left-to-right and Splash makes every played card count in scoring, I should consider if repositioning them would improve my scoring potential.\n\nMystic Summit provides +15 Mult when I have no discards left, while Zany Joker adds +12 Mult for Three of a Kind hands. Since these effects stack additively without interacting, the arrangement has minimal impact. Splash's effect is automatic regardless of position, and Mystic Summit works better as a final bonus multiplier. The current setup is solid.\n\n4. **Should I sell a joker?** - No, I need the full lineup for the boss fight. My Four of a Kind barely cleared 4,000 chips last round, so removing any joker would cripple my scoring potential.\n\n5. **Should I just play the round?** - Yes. My deck is strong enough with Splash ensuring every card contributes and Mystic Summit providing the final multiplier boost.\n\nI also have a Holo Mult 9 of Spades, a leveled-up Full House, and Zany Joker for Three of a Kind synergy. The face-down first hand is manageable since Merry Andy grants +3 discards per round, giving me flexibility to scout and adjust my strategy. Based on recent hands scoring 3,900+ chips and the 4,000 threshold, I'm ready to face the boss blind.","action":"\"play_round\""}
