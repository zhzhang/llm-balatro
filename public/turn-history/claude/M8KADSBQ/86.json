{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades - +10 chips\n2. 4 of Spades - +4 chips\n3. Ace of Hearts - +11 chips\n4. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips\n5. 9 of Hearts - +9 chips\n6. 5 of Clubs - +5 chips\n7. King of Diamonds - +10 chips +4 Mult (Mult enhancement)\n\n**Goal:** Need 2000 chips to beat Small Blind\n\n**Available Resources:**\n- 3 hands remaining\n- 7 discards remaining\n- Merry Andy gives +3 discards but -1 hand size (so I have 7 cards instead of 8)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Misprint - Random mult bonus\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Magician - Enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards\n2. Pluto - Levels up High Card\n\n**Analyzing current hand:**\n- No pairs visible\n- Face cards: Jack of Spades, Queen of Hearts, King of Diamonds (all different ranks)\n- Hearts: Ace, Queen, 9 (3 hearts, not enough for flush)\n- No obvious Three of a Kind or Two Pair\n\nSince I have Splash, all played cards count in scoring. This is important.\n\n**Best Current Option:**\nWith no pairs, I should discard and try to get pairs or Three of a Kind to activate Zany Joker.\n\nI have 7 discards, which is plenty. Let me discard the weakest cards that don't form any patterns:\n\n\n- Keep: Jack of Spades, Queen of Hearts, King of Diamonds (high face cards)\n- Discard: 4 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 5 of Clubs\n\nActually, the Ace's 11 chips is valuable, and I need to think strategically about what hands I can build. With Splash active, maximizing chip potential matters more than I initially considered. I should look for opportunities to form pairs or three of a kind to trigger Zany Joker's multiplier, or potentially draw cards that create a straight if the right cards come up.\n\nI have three hearts already, so a flush is possible with two more draws. But given the deck composition—with only 3 remaining Kings, 3 remaining Queens, 3 remaining Jacks, and 3 remaining Aces—my best strategy is to keep the high cards and discard the low-value ones to maximize my chances of hitting a pair or stronger hand.\n\nI'll discard the 4 of Spades, 5 of Clubs, and 9 of Hearts, keeping my Jack of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Queen of Hearts, and King of Diamonds. The King's Mult enhancement makes it especially worth holding onto. Since I can discard up to 5 cards, I should consider whether keeping these face cards gives me the best odds of drawing into pairs or trips from the remaining deck.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,5,6]"}
