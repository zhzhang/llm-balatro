{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 2,997\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 6\n- Money: $36\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 for $20)\n4. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult, +10 Mult from holo edition, Mult enhancement)\n5. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n6. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Analysis:**\nI need 10,000 - 2,997 = 7,003 more chips with only 2 hands remaining.\n\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Pair of 8s (8 of Clubs with Mult enhancement + holo edition, 8 of Diamonds)\n- High cards: King of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs (Lucky), Queen of Diamonds, 4 of Clubs, 5 of Diamonds\n\nThe 8 of Clubs is special - it has:\n\n\n- Mult enhancement: +4 Mult\n- Holo edition: +10 Mult\n- Total: +14 Mult from this single card when scored\n\nKey considerations:\n1. I have 6 discards remaining, which means if I use them all, Mystic Summit will activate on my final hand (+15 Mult)\n2. Splash makes every played card count in scoring\n3. I need to average 3,500+ chips per hand to win\n\nLet me think about possible hands:\n- Pair with the 8s: Base 25 chips + 3x mult from Level 2 Pair\n  - Card chips: 8 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 11 = 47 chips total\n  - Mult: 3x from pair, +14 from 8 of Clubs, +12 from Zany Joker (Three of a Kind), +15 from Mystic Summit if discards depleted\n  - This could yield significant scoring if I deplete my discards first\n\nWith 6 discards available, I should explore whether pursuing a Three of a Kind or Flush is viable. A Three of a Kind would unlock Zany Joker's bonus, while a Flush needs just one more club. The Straight is also possible but requires specific sequencing.\n\nThe core question is whether I should commit discards now to chase a stronger hand, or play conservatively and rely on Mystic Summit's final activation. I'm looking at my suit distribution: 3 Clubs, 2 Hearts, and 3 Diamonds. I could pursue a Flush by discarding the Hearts to draw more Clubs, or go after Diamonds instead. Since the 8 of Clubs has that +14 Mult bonus, I should definitely keep it along with the Ace of Clubs for potential Lucky procs. I'll discard the King and 10 of Hearts plus the 4 of Clubs to cycle for stronger cards that might help me build toward a better hand.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5]"}
