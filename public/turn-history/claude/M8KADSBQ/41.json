{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Boss Description: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n- Current Money: $0\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Jokers (in order):**\n1. Green Joker: +7 Mult (scales with hands/discards)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Available Commands:**\n- play_round\n- use_consumable\n- sell_consumable\n- rearrange_jokers\n- sell_joker\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at the BLIND_SELECT phase for a Boss Blind. The only option here is to play the round since I have no consumables to use and no reason to sell jokers or rearrange them before starting.\n\nHowever, let me think about joker order. According to the rules, joker effects are applied left-to-right in their respective categories:\n1. Boss Blind effects activate first\n2. 'On played' Jokers trigger (before scoring)\n3. Played cards score left-to-right\n4. Held-in-hand abilities check left-to-right\n5. 'Independent' Jokers activate left-to-right (basic Joker, editions on Jokers)\n\nMy jokers:\n- Green Joker: Independent, adds +7 mult\n- Merry Andy: Modifies discards/hand size (not scoring)\n- Zany Joker: Conditional +12 mult if Three of a Kind\n- Splash: Makes all played cards score (affects scoring mechanics)\n\n\n- Mystic Summit: Independent, +15 mult when 0 discards\n\nFor optimal scoring, Splash should trigger early since it modifies how cards contribute to the scoring calculation. The multiplicative bonuses from Green Joker, Zany Joker, and Mystic Summit are independent effects that activate sequentially, but since they're all additive, their positioning relative to each other doesn't impact the final total—they simply accumulate together.\n\nWith no consumables or money available and the boss blind active, I need to play the round. Before doing so, let me verify the scoring: a Pair with Mystic Summit at 0 discards yields 25 base chips and 3 base mult, then Green Joker adds 7 mult (10 total), Mystic Summit adds 15 mult (25 total), and Splash ensures all played cards contribute to the score. Playing 2 Kings plus 2 additional cards within the hand size constraint would generate chips from the Pair plus individual card scoring.\n\nThe calculation shows this approach could exceed the blind requirement in a single hand. Since the joker bonuses are purely additive, the arrangement doesn't affect the outcome—what matters is exhausting my discards first to reach 0 remaining, then playing the final hand to trigger Mystic Summit's multiplier boost.\n\nI'll initiate the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
