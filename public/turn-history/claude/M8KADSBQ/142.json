{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state to determine the best action.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (selecting from a Celestial Pack)\n- Money: $42\n- I have 6 jokers, 1 consumable\n\n**Pack Choices:**\n1. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips (would go from Level 2 to Level 3)\n2. Uranus - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips (would go from Level 1 to Level 2)\n3. Saturn - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips (would go from Level 2 to Level 3)\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5, Times Played 5\n- Two Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2, Times Played 4\n- Straight: Level 2, Base Chips 60, Base Mult 7, Times Played 4\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- Three of a Kind: Played 5 times, most recent scores were 2,912 and 4,324 chips\n- Straight: Played 4 times, most recent scores were 2,997 and 4,662 chips\n- Two Pair: Played 4 times, most recent score was 1,650 chips\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n1. **Three of a Kind (Venus)**: This is my most-played hand and synergizes perfectly with Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind). If I select Venus, it would become Level 3 with Base Chips 70 and Base Mult 7.\n\n2. **Straight (Saturn)**: Also heavily played (4 times), and Saturn offers a bigger upgrade (+3 Mult and +30 chips). If I select Saturn, Straight would become Level 3 with Base Chips 90 and Base Mult 10.\n   \nTwo Pair underperforms compared to the other options—it's only scored 1,650 chips despite being played the same number of times. Three of a Kind has the advantage of my Zany Joker providing +12 Mult specifically for it, creating strong synergy. Straight offers the largest stat boost, but Three of a Kind's dedicated joker support and consistent performance make it the more reliable choice for scaling my score.\n\nLet me work through the math. Three of a Kind at Level 3 gives 70 chips and 7 mult, plus the Zany Joker adds 12 mult for 19 total. With Splash making all five cards count, I'd get 41 chips from the card values, bringing the total to 111 chips × 19 mult = 2,109 chips. Straight at Level 3 reaches 90 chips and 10 mult, but without a dedicated joker boost, it won't scale as high even with the better base stats.\n\nI'm leaning toward Three of a Kind because it's been my most consistent performer, especially with how well the Zany Joker synergizes with it. My recent scores of 2,912 and 4,324 chips show it has real scaling potential, and that reliability matters more than chasing a slightly higher base chip count with Straight.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
