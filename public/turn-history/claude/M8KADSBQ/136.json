{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 2,997\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Money: $36\n\n**Chips needed to win:** 10,000 - 2,997 = 7,003 more chips with 2 hands remaining\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n2. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n3. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult from enhancement, +10 Mult from holo edition = +14 Mult total)\n5. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nI have THREE 8s: 8♣, 8♦, 8♦. This is a Three of a Kind!\n\nI have 2 discards remaining. If I use both of them, I'll have 0 discards remaining, which will trigger Mystic Summit for +15 Mult.\n\nLet me calculate the chips for playing Three of a Kind with Mystic Summit active:\n\n**Three of a Kind scoring:**\n- Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n\n\n- Base mult: 5 (Level 2)\n\nIf I play the three 8s and two other high-value cards (e.g., King of Clubs and Queen of Diamonds):\n- Card chips (with Splash, all 5 cards count): 8 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 10 = 44 chips\n- Total chips: 50 + 44 = 94 chips\n- Mult: 5 (base) + 12 (Zany Joker for Three of a Kind) + 14 (8 of Clubs) + 15 (Mystic Summit) = 46 Mult\n- Total: 94 × 46 = 4,324 chips\n\nThis brings me to 2,997 + 4,324 = 7,321 chips, so I'd need 2,679 more from my final hand. Since Mystic Summit stays active with 0 discards remaining, even a simple pair should get me there. I have 2 discards left to work with—the 4 of Hearts and 6 of Spades are my weakest options to swap out, though I need to be careful not to break up the three 8s I'm counting on for the Three of a Kind bonus.\n\nThe key decision is timing: using both discards now means this hand scores with Mystic Summit active, and my final hand would also benefit from it. If I hold them for later, I'd lose the multiplier on this current hand. So I should discard those two weak cards now to potentially draw better ones while keeping the Mystic Summit bonus active for both hands.\n\nWith the multiplier working on both scoring rounds, hitting my 3,500 chip average per hand should be manageable. I'll go ahead and discard the 4 of Hearts and 6 of Spades.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2]"}
