{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 9 (I'm in the middle of Ante 3)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $2\n- Jokers: 5/5 (FULL) - Merry Andy, Zany Joker, Splash, Mystic Summit, Juggler\n- Consumables: 1/2 - Pluto (level up High Card)\n- Vouchers: Hieroglyph (-1 Ante, -1 hand each round)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- No cards in shop\n- Standard Pack - $4 (can't afford)\n- Director's Cut voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Recent History:**\n- Turn 97: Used The Star tarot to convert 3 cards to Diamonds\n- Turn 98: Bought Jupiter for $3\n- Turn 99: Used Jupiter to level up Flush (now Level 2: 50 chips, 6 mult)\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush is now Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) - just leveled up\n- Three of a Kind is Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult)\n- Pair is Level 2 (25 chips, 3 mult)\n- Straight is Level 2 (60 chips, 7 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI have $2 left and can't afford anything in the shop. My options:\n1. Use Pluto to level up High Card\n2. Sell something\n3. Proceed to round select\n\nSince I just set up a flush strategy by:\n- Converting cards to Diamonds\n- Leveling up Flush to Level 2\n\nI don't think leveling up High Card is strategically sound right now. High Card is my weakest hand type and I haven't played it once. \n\nWith my joker synergies in place and Flush now strengthened, I should move forward to the next blind rather than spend resources on High Card. Using `round_select` will let me continue building on this momentum.","action":"\"round_select\""}
