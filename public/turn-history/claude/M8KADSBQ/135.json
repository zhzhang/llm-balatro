{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 2,997\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Money: $36\n\n**Chips needed to win:** 10,000 - 2,997 = 7,003 more chips with 2 hands remaining\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n3. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult from enhancement, +10 Mult from holo edition = +14 Mult total)\n5. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nI have THREE 8s: 8♣, 8♦, 8♦. This is a Three of a Kind!\n\nLet me calculate the potential chips for playing Three of a Kind:\n\n**Three of a Kind scoring:**\n- Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n- Base mult: 5 (Level 2)\n\nIf I play the three 8s and two other cards (e.g., Queen of Spades and King of Clubs):\n\n\n- Card chips (with Splash, all 5 cards count): 8 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 10 = 44 chips\n- Total chips: 50 + 44 = 94 chips\n- Mult: 5 (base) + 12 (Zany Joker for Three of a Kind) + 14 (8 of Clubs) = 31 mult\n- Total: 94 × 31 = 2,914 chips\n\nI have 3 discards left, so if I use them all, Mystic Summit triggers for +15 Mult when I reach 0 discards remaining.\n\nWith that active, mult becomes 5 + 12 + 14 + 15 = 46, giving me 94 × 46 = 4,324 chips this hand. Combined with my previous score, that's 2,997 + 4,324 = 7,321 chips, leaving me needing 2,679 from my final hand. Since Mystic Summit stays active with no discards, even a basic pair should cover it.\n\nFor discards, I'm keeping the 8 of Clubs for its mult bonuses, both 8 of Diamonds, and the highest-value cards to maximize chip generation. d discard the low-value cards: 2 of Spades, 4 of Diamonds. And maybe one more card.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I should use my remaining 3 discards wisely to potentially improve my hand for the final play. But I also want to trigger Mystic Summit on THIS hand, not just the next one.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. Mystic Summit triggers when I have 0 discards remaining AT THE TIME I PLAY. So if I use all 3 discards now, I'll have 0 discards remaining, and Mystic Summit will be active when I play this hand AND my final hand.\n\nSo my strategy should be:\n1. Use all 3 remaining discards to try to improve my hand\n2. Play this hand with Mystic Summit active\n3. Play my final hand with Mystic Summit still active\n\nFor discarding, I'm targeting the weakest cards—2 of Spades and 4 of Diamonds—but I should also consider whether building toward a Flush makes sense. I have four Diamonds already (Queen, 8, 8, 4), so drawing one more Diamond would give me a Flush worth 80+ chips with multiplier scaling from the 8 of Clubs.\n\nBut wait, the 8 of Clubs isn't a Diamond, so it wouldn't contribute its +14 mult bonus to the Flush. That means a Flush would only get the base 6x mult plus 15 from Mystic Summit, totaling 21x mult on roughly 80-90 chips—only 1,700-1,900 chips total. That's significantly weaker than my Three of a Kind plan.\n\nI should stick with Three of a Kind and discard the 2 of Spades, 4 of Diamonds, and one of the Queens. Actually, I need to discard exactly 3 cards to reach 0 discards and trigger Mystic Summit. The low-value cards—2 of Spades and 4 of Diamonds—should definitely go. For the third discard, I'll remove one of the duplicate Queens since I have both Queen of Diamonds and Queen of Spades, keeping the higher-value cards for my hand.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,8]"}
