{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 8 of Spades - +8 chips\n2. King of Hearts - +10 chips\n3. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n4. 6 of Hearts - +6 chips\n5. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips, +4 Mult (Mult Card enhancement)\n6. King of Diamonds - +10 chips, +4 Mult (Mult Card enhancement)\n7. 9 of Diamonds - +9 chips\n\n**Situation:**\n- Boss Blind: Play only 1 hand\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Remaining hands: 1\n- Remaining discards: 2\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have:\n- A pair of 8s (8 of Spades and 8 of Clubs)\n- A pair of Kings (King of Hearts and King of Diamonds)\n- So I have TWO PAIR!\n\n**Strategy from previous turns:**\nI've been discarding to get to 0 discards remaining to trigger Mystic Summit. I have 2 discards left, so I need to discard 2 more times to reach 0 discards.\n\n**Let me calculate what I'll score:**\n\nIf I discard 2 more times (to reach 0 discards), then play my hand:\n\nWith Mystic Summit active (0 discards remaining):\n- Two Pair (Level 1): 20 chips + 2 mult\n- Card chips (all cards count due to Splash): 8 + 10 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 9 = 58 chips\n\n\n- Card mult: +4 (8 of Clubs) + +4 (King of Diamonds) = +8 mult\n- Mystic Summit: +15 mult (when 0 discards remaining)\n- Total: (20 + 58) × (2 + 8 + 15) = 78 × 25 = 1,950 chips\n\nThis comfortably exceeds the 800 chips needed. I could also pursue Three of a Kind with my remaining discards—there are still 2 eights and 2 kings left in the deck—but the guaranteed Two Pair approach with Mystic Summit's multiplier boost is already sufficient to win. Mystic Summit adds another 15 mult, bringing the total to (50 + 58) × (5 + 8 + 12 + 15) = 108 × 40 = 4,320 chips. That's significantly stronger than the Two Pair option. The challenge is hitting either an 8 or King in my next two discards—only 4 cards out of 29 remaining in the deck match what I need. The probability of failing both attempts is roughly 74%, leaving about a 26% chance of success.\n\nEven without hitting those cards, my Two Pair fallback scores 1,950 chips, which comfortably exceeds the 800 threshold. The conservative approach is to discard the unpaired cards—7 of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, and 9 of Diamonds—to lock in the Two Pair while keeping my options open for one more draw. I'll remove those three cards now and use my final discard afterward.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,7]"}
