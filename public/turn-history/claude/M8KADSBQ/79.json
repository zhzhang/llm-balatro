{"reasoning":"The user's previous action failed because they tried to select position 2 (which would be the Aura card from the booster pack). The error says \"Cannot select this pack card. Please try a different selection.\"\n\nLooking at the booster pack choices:\n1. Cryptid - Create 2 copies of 1 selected card in your hand\n2. Aura - Add Foil, Holographic, or Polychrome effect to 1 selected card in hand\n\nThe user was trying to select Aura (position 2), but it seems like that requires a different approach. Let me think about the select command:\n\n`select <pack_card_position> <hand_card_position1> <hand_card_position2> ... <hand_card_positionN>`\n\nThe Aura card needs a target card in hand to apply the edition to. So when selecting Aura, I need to specify which card in hand to apply it to.\n\nLooking at the hand:\n1. 5 of Spades - +5 chips\n2. 3 of Spades - +3 chips\n3. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips\n4. 5 of Hearts - +5 chips\n5. 3 of Hearts - +3 chips\n6. 10 of Clubs - +10 chips\n7. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips +4 Mult (Mult Card enhancement)\n\nThe best target for Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) would be the 8 of Clubs (position 7) since it already has the +4 Mult enhancement. This would multiply the entire mult by 1.5 at the end.\n\nSo the command should be: select 2 7\n\nThis selects booster pack card 2 (Aura) and applies it to hand card position 7 (8 of Clubs).\n\nLet me verify this is the right approach based on the user's previous reasoning - they wanted Aura with Polychrome on the 8 of Clubs, which makes sense given the multiplicative scaling.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,7]"}
