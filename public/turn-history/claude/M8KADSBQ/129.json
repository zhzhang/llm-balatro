{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $16 (gained from skipping the previous two blinds with Skip Tag)\n- Facing Boss Blind: Need 10,000 chips, must play 5 cards\n\n**My Current Setup:**\nJokers:\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nConsumables:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card\n\nTags:\n1. Negative Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Negative\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my last played hands:\n- Straight: 4,662 chips (Ante 3 Boss)\n- Four of a Kind: 4,180 chips (Ante 3 Big)\n- Full House: 3,906 chips (Ante 3 Small)\n\nI need 10,000 chips for this Boss Blind - that's more than double my best score of 4,662.\n\nThe Boss requirement is \"Must play 5 cards\" - this actually synergizes well with my Splash joker since every played card counts in scoring.\n\nHowever, with my current jokers, I'm severely underpowered. I need to think about whether I should:\n1. Use Pluto to level up High Card before entering the round\n2. Try to play the round as is\n3. Sell something to potentially prepare better\n\nWait, I'm at the BLIND_SELECT phase. My only command option is to play_round since boss blinds cannot be skipped. Let me check the available commands:\n\nAvailable Commands:\n\n\n- play_round - Play the current round\n- use_consumable\n- sell_consumable\n- rearrange_jokers\n- sell_joker\n\nI have several options before committing to the round. Using Pluto to upgrade High Card would boost it from Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult) to Level 2 (15 chips, 2 mult), which could help incrementally. Alternatively, I could sell items to free up resources, though with only $16 available, this might not yield significant improvements for the 10,000-chip requirement.\n\nThe joker arrangement seems more promising. Since scoring follows a specific sequence—boss effects first, then played jokers, cards left to right, scored jokers left to right, and independent jokers—I need to consider how Splash, Zany Joker, and Mystic Summit interact. Splash affects every card, so positioning it early could amplify subsequent effects. Zany Joker's +12 mult for Three of a Kind and Mystic Summit's +15 mult at 0 discards both have conditional triggers that depend on my hand composition and play style.\n\nThe real constraint is that I'm significantly underpowered for the 10,000 chip threshold. My best shot involves playing the round and hoping the card draws align favorably with my current setup.\n\nPluto could improve my High Card hands, but that's not my strategy—I'm banking on hitting Straights, Three of a Kind, or Full Houses where Splash and the conditional multipliers actually matter. Holding onto Pluto for a more opportune moment makes more sense than using it now.","action":"\"play_round\""}
