{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2 (Big Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 450\n- Current Chips: 162\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $1\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n2: Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3: 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n4: Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5: 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n6: Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7: 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker - Currently +1 Mult (increased from +0 after playing the last hand)\n2. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n\n**What I need:**\n- I need 450 - 162 = 288 more chips\n- I have 3 hands remaining\n- Average needed per hand: 288 / 3 = 96 chips per hand\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLet me check what I can make:\n- Pairs: 4♠ + 4♥ (pair of 4s), J♥ + J♣ + J♦ (three Jacks!)\n- Three of a Kind: J♥ + J♣ + J♦ (three Jacks)\n- Two Pair: 4-4 and... wait, I only have one other pair (the Jacks, but that's three of them)\n- Full House: None (I'd need the 4s plus three of another rank, but I have three Jacks)\n- Actually, wait - I have two 4s and three Jacks. That's not a full house because full house is three of one rank and two of another.\n\n\n- Straights and flushes won't work - I don't have five consecutive ranks, and my suits are too scattered across the hand.\n\nThe strongest play is the three Jacks, which gives me 30 chips and 3 multiplier as the base hand.\n\nCalculating the total: three Jacks contribute 30 chips each for 90 chips, multiplied by 4 (the base 3 plus the Green Joker's +1) equals 360 chips. This would put me at 522 chips total, well above the 450 needed. Even if I miscalculated, the remaining hands should easily cover any shortfall since I only need about 48 more chips across two hands. Plus, the Green Joker levels up after this, making subsequent plays even stronger.\n\nI need to select exactly 5 cards for the hand. I'll pick the three Jacks and add two filler cards that won't score—something like the 4♠ and 10♦—since only the cards matching the hand type contribute to the chip total.\n\nThe three Jacks give me 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 chips on top of the base 30 from three of a kind, totaling 60 chips. With the Green Joker adding a multiplier, I get 60 × 4 = 240 chips. I'll submit positions 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 as my play.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,4,6,1,7]"}
