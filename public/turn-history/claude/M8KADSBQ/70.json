{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades - +11 chips\n2. 8 of Spades - +8 chips\n3. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips\n4. Jack of Hearts - +10 chips\n5. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips, +4 Mult (Mult Card enhancement)\n6. King of Diamonds - +10 chips, +4 Mult (Mult Card enhancement)\n7. 10 of Diamonds - +10 chips\n\n**Situation:**\n- Boss Blind: Play only 1 hand\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Remaining hands: 1\n- Remaining discards: 6\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have a PAIR of 8s! (8 of Spades and 8 of Clubs)\n\nLet me think about the best strategy:\n\n**Option 1: Play the pair of 8s now**\nWith Splash, all 7 cards count in scoring:\n- Pair (Level 2): 25 chips + 3 mult\n- Card chips: 11+8+10+10+8+10+10 = 67 chips\n- Card mult from the two Mult Cards: +4 (8 of Clubs) + +4 (King of Diamonds) = +8 mult\n- Total: (25 + 67) × (3 + 8) = 92 × 11 = 1,012 chips\n\nThat's already over 800! But let me check if I can do better by continuing to discard.\n\n\n**Option 2: Continue discarding to look for Three of a Kind**\nI have 6 more discards available. If I can draw a third 8, Zany Joker triggers for +12 Mult. However, only 2 more 8s remain in the deck since I'm holding 2 of the 4 total. A three of a kind would score 50 chips + 5 mult with the three 8s contributing 24 chips, plus the remaining cards at 51 chips if kept.\n\nThat gives me 125 chips × 25 mult = 3,125 total—significantly better than my current path, but requires hitting that third 8 with limited discards left.\n\n**Option 3: Use The Magician on two high cards, then play**\nI could enhance two cards into Lucky Cards, each with a 1 in 5 chance to grant +20 Mult. Applying this to high-value cards like the King and Ace would substantially increase my final score compared to the pair of 8s alone, which only reaches 1,012 chips.\n\n**Option 4: Keep discarding to 0 discards, then play with Mystic Summit active**\nIf I exhaust my discards, Mystic Summit activates for +15 Mult, bringing my pair to 2,392 chips.\n\n**Decision:**\nMy current pair already exceeds 800 chips, but I should consider whether discarding strategically to trigger Mystic Summit or using The Magician on high cards offers better upside than chasing the third 8.\n\nThe key tension: I have 6 discards available. Burning all of them activates Mystic Summit's bonus, but leaves me no flexibility. Alternatively, I could discard selectively while hunting for another 8 to form a Three of a Kind, which would score significantly higher. If that fails, The Magician can boost two cards before playing the pair.\n\nMy best approach is to discard 5 times while keeping the two 8s, hoping to draw a third. If I don't find it, I'll still have one discard left to adjust my hand before playing.\n\nFor the discards themselves, I should shed the lowest-value cards—Ace of Spades, Queen of Hearts, Jack of Hearts, 10 of Diamonds—while preserving the 8 of Clubs and King of Diamonds for their Mult bonuses. This leaves me with a solid foundation to work from.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,7]"}
