{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small (800 chips needed)\n- Current Money: $3\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 7\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n2. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n7. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: Currently +3 Mult (increases with hands played, decreases with discards)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size (so I can only hold 6 cards, wait... I have 7 cards in hand. Let me reconsider. Actually, Merry Andy gives -1 hand size, which typically means the max hand size is reduced. But I see 7 cards in my hand. Maybe the hand size reduction applies to the number of cards I can select to play? Let me re-read... \"Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size.\" This likely means I can hold fewer cards at a time, but I'm seeing 7 cards. This might be a display issue or the hand size reduction hasn't been applied yet.)\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- No pairs (all different ranks)\n- No straights (7, 5, 10, 9, Q, 4, 2 - not consecutive)\n\n\n- No flush possible with this distribution (two Spades, two Hearts, one Club, two Diamonds)\n- Best available is High Card\n\n**Strategy:**\nI have 7 discards and 4 hands remaining to reach 800 chips. I should use discards liberally to search for stronger combinations. With my current hand offering only High Card value, I need to fish for pairs or better hands. The Green Joker's multiplier will help, and if I can hit a Three of a Kind, the Zany Joker adds significant value.\n\n**Scoring potential:**\nPlaying 5 cards with Splash means all selected cards contribute to the chip count. My best 5 cards (10, 10, 9, 7, 5) give 41 chips, multiplied by 4 (base 1 + Green Joker 3) equals 164 chips per hand. But I need to account for Merry Andy's hand size penalty—it reduces my playable cards, so I'm limited to 5 cards maximum per play anyway. This baseline of ~164 chips per hand means I need stronger hands in my remaining plays to hit the 800 target.\n\nThree of a kind would be ideal. With three 10s, I'd score 30 base chips plus 50 from the cards themselves (10×5), giving 80 chips. The multiplier jumps to 18 (3 base + 3 from Green Joker + 12 from Zany Joker), resulting in 1,440 chips—well above the requirement. A pair would also work, though it provides less multiplier boost than three of a kind.\n\nI should discard aggressively to chase better cards. With 7 discards available, I can afford to dump the low cards like 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9, keeping only the 10 and Queen as anchors for potential pairs or trips.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [7,6,2,1,4]"}
