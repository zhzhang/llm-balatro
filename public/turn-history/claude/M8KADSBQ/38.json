{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase, meaning I need to choose one of three planet cards\n- I have $5 remaining after buying the Celestial Pack\n- I'm about to face the Boss Blind which requires 1600 chips\n\n**Planet Card Options:**\n1. Earth - Level up Full House (+2 Mult, +25 chips) - takes Full House from 40/4 to 65/6\n2. Saturn - Level up Straight (+3 Mult, +30 chips) - takes Straight from 30/4 to 60/7\n3. Pluto - Level up High Card (+1 Mult, +10 chips) - takes High Card from 5/1 to 15/2\n\n**My Play History:**\nLooking at my last played hands:\n- Pair: 4 times (most recent: 784, 621, 378, 180 chips)\n- Two Pair: 3 times (497, 366 chips)\n- Straight: 2 times (486 chips)\n- Three of a Kind: 1 time (300 chips)\n- Flush: 1 time\n- High Card: 0 times\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +7 Mult (scales with hands played/discarded)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Boss Blind Challenge:**\nThe next blind shows \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\" - this means I won't be able to see my cards clearly, making it harder to form specific hands.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nNone of these planet cards directly upgrade Pair or Two Pair, which are my most-played hands. However, I need to think strategically:\n\n\n- Earth upgrades Full House, but I've never played one and forming three of a kind plus a pair will be nearly impossible with obscured cards\n- Saturn boosts Straight from 30/4 to 60/7, a meaningful improvement, though identifying five consecutive cards face-down presents challenges\n- Pluto upgrades High Card, which I haven't used at all and seems like a weak option even with the boost to 15/2\n\nSince I can't reliably see card details in the Boss Blind, I should prioritize hands that don't depend on precise identification. Pairs have consistently delivered strong scores (784 and 621 chips), and they're simple to spot regardless of card visibility. The splash joker means every card I play contributes, so sticking with what I know works makes more sense than gambling on hands I can't easily form or recognize. I've used Straights a couple times before and they scored reasonably well, so upgrading them with Saturn makes sense. The boost from 30/4 to 60/7 is substantial enough that if I can form one, it'll significantly outperform my usual plays. Full House remains too difficult to assemble consistently, and High Card is too weak to justify. Saturn's Straight upgrade gives me a viable backup option when the Boss Blind's face-down mechanic makes my typical approach harder to execute.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
