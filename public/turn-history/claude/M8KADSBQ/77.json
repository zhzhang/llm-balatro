{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers: Merry Andy, Zany Joker, Splash, Mystic Summit (4/5 slots used)\n- Consumables: The Magician (1/2 slots used)\n- Voucher: Hieroglyph\n\n**Shop:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Pluto (Planet) - Levels up High Card, Cost: $0 (FREE due to Coupon Tag!)\n  2. Misprint (Joker) - \"+.\" description (seems incomplete), Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n- Boosters:\n  1. Standard Pack - Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n  2. Spectral Pack - Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Director's Cut - Cost: $10 (too expensive)\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe Coupon Tag makes the initial cards and boosters FREE! This is excellent. Let me consider what to do:\n\n1. **Pluto** - Levels up High Card. I haven't been playing High Card at all (0 times played). This seems low priority.\n\n2. **Misprint** - The description just says \"+.\" which is incomplete. However, I know from Balatro that Misprint is a joker that gives a random mult between +0 and +23 each round. This could be useful but is very random.\n\n3. **Standard Pack** - Choose 1 of up to 3 playing cards. Could help me get better cards for my deck.\n\n4. **Spectral Pack** - Choose 1 of up to 2 Spectral cards to use immediately. Spectral cards can have powerful effects like adding/changing cards, creating jokers, etc.\n\n\nMy approach so far has centered on Splash to track all cards played, with Three of a Kind and Two Pair as my primary hands. Three of a Kind is at Level 2 (played 3 times), Two Pair at Level 1 (4 times), Pair at Level 2 (5 times), and Straight at Level 2 (2 times). I have room for one more joker and one more consumable, so I need to decide what additions would best complement my current setup.\n\nWith $5 available, the Spectral Pack stands out as the highest priority since spectral cards offer immediate powerful effects. The Standard Pack could also strengthen my deck quality, though it's less impactful than the spectral option. Misprint is tempting as a random mult joker but feels too inconsistent for my needs. I'll skip Pluto since High Card doesn't factor into my strategy. The Spectral Pack should be my first purchase.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
