{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**My Inventory:**\n- 5 Jokers (at max capacity):\n  1. Green Joker: +1 Mult per hand played, -1 per discard (currently +1)\n  2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n  3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n  4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n  5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n- 1 Consumable (max 2):\n  1. Venus: Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\n\n**Shop Items:**\n1. The Lovers (Tarot): Enhances 1 card into Wild Card - $3\n2. Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n3. Jumbo Spectral Pack: Choose 1 of 4 Spectral cards - $6\n4. Hieroglyph (Voucher): -1 Ante, -1 hand each round - $10\n5. Current Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just bought Venus for $3, leaving me with $5. Venus will level up Three of a Kind from Level 1 (30 chips, 3 mult) to Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult). This is crucial since my strategy revolves around Three of a Kind with Zany Joker.\n\nNow I need to decide what to do with my remaining $5:\n\nOptions:\n1. Use Venus immediately to level up Three of a Kind\n2. Buy The Lovers for $3 (would have $2 left)\n3. Buy Standard Pack for $4 (would have $1 left)\n\n\n4. Reroll the shop for $5 (would have $0 left)\n5. Save the money and proceed to round_select\n\nThe priority is activating Venus right now to boost Three of a Kind, which synergizes perfectly with Zany Joker's +12 Mult bonus. Once I level it up, I'll reassess what to purchase with the remaining funds.\n\nThe command should be: use_consumable 1\n\nVenus works without needing to target specific cards—it simply upgrades the hand type directly.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
