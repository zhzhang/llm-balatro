{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Shop phase)\n- Current Money: $3\n- I just leveled up Pair from Level 1 to Level 2 (now 25 base chips, 3 base mult)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +3 Mult (scales with hands played, -1 per discard)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Bootstraps: $7 (I only have $3)\n- To the Moon: $5 (I only have $3)\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: $6 (I only have $3)\n- Tarot Merchant Voucher: $10 (I only have $3)\n- Reroll: $5 (I only have $3)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith only $3, I cannot afford any of the items in the shop. My options are:\n1. Continue to the next round to earn more money\n2. Sell a joker to get enough money for something\n\nLet me think about whether I should sell a joker:\n\n**Joker Values:**\n- Green Joker: Sells for $2 → Would have $5 total (could buy To the Moon or reroll)\n- Merry Andy: Sells for $3 → Would have $6 total (could buy Jumbo Arcana Pack)\n- Zany Joker: Sells for $2 → Would have $5 total (could buy To the Moon or reroll)\n- Splash: Sells for $1 → Would have $4 total (not enough for anything)\n\n**Should I sell a joker?**\n\n\nEach of my jokers contributes meaningfully to my scoring engine. Green Joker provides steady mult growth, Merry Andy enables better hand selection through extra discards, Zany Joker delivers burst damage on Three of a Kind, and Splash amplifies my overall chip generation. If I skip this shop and finish the remaining hands, I'd earn enough to afford To the Moon next round, which would accelerate my economy without sacrificing any current synergies. I should use the `round_select` command to move forward without making any purchases, which will let me accumulate more resources before deciding on upgrades.","action":"\"round_select\""}
