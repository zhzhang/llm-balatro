{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in a TAROT_PACK selection phase\n- I have 3 Tarot card options to choose from\n- Current Money: $3\n- I have 4 jokers with 1 open slot\n\n**Tarot Pack Choices:**\n1. **The Empress** - Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n2. **The Hermit** - Doubles money (Max of $20)\n3. **The Star** - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Diamonds\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n2. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n3. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n4. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n5. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +5 Mult (scales with hands played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **The Empress (+4 Mult cards)**: This would enhance 2 cards to give +4 Mult each when played. With Splash, all played cards count in scoring, so these would always contribute +4 Mult when played. This could be quite powerful. If I enhance the King and the 8, for example, I'd get consistent +8 Mult from those cards when they're played.\n\n2. **The Hermit (double money)**: I currently have $3. Doubling would give me $6 total. \n\nThis boosts my economy by $3, which could be useful for future shop purchases since I'm still early in Ante 2/8.\n\n3. **The Star (convert to Diamonds)**: Converting 3 cards to Diamonds could help me build flushes. However, looking at my current hand, I already have 5 Clubs and 2 Diamonds. If I convert 3 cards to Diamonds, I'd have 5 Diamonds potentially, which could enable flush plays. But with Splash making all cards count, and my jokers not specifically rewarding flushes, this seems less valuable than the other options.\n\nLooking at my play patterns, I've been relying on Pairs and Two Pairs, with my Two Pair still at Level 1. The Empress offers a more immediate scaling benefit—permanent +4 Mult on 2 cards means those cards always contribute +8 Mult total when Splash is active, which compounds better than the economy boost. The Hermit's $3 gain is modest compared to the multiplicative value the Empress provides, especially since my Green Joker is already scaling well and I need stronger hand multipliers to progress further.\n\nHowever, I'm reconsidering because economy matters significantly in Balatro. The Big Blind is coming next at Ante 2, and having $6 total would open up better shop options—potentially a $5 joker or the flexibility to reroll and purchase something more impactful. My current joker setup is already functional with Green Joker's growth, so the immediate economic advantage might be more valuable than another multiplicative boost right now.\n\nActually, the permanent scaling from The Empress is hard to ignore. Adding +8 Mult through enhanced cards that trigger every hand would compound with my existing Green Joker (+5 Mult growing), creating a stronger foundation for future rounds. Since Splash means every card in my hand contributes, enhancing the King of Diamonds and 8 of Clubs to Mult Cards gives me reliable damage that persists. I'll go with The Empress and enhance those two positions.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,6,2]"}
