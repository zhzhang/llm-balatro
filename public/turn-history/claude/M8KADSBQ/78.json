{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Game State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SPECTRAL_PACK (need to choose one of two spectral cards)\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Spectral Pack Choices:**\n1. **Cryptid** - Create 2 copies of 1 selected card in your hand\n2. **Aura** - Add Foil, Holographic, or Polychrome effect to 1 selected card in hand\n   - Foil: +50 chips\n   - Holographic: +10 Mult\n   - Polychrome: X1.5 Mult\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 5 of Spades - +5 chips\n2. 3 of Spades - +3 chips\n3. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips\n4. 5 of Hearts - +5 chips\n5. 3 of Hearts - +3 chips\n6. 10 of Clubs - +10 chips\n7. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips +4 Mult (Mult Card enhancement)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me think about what each option offers:\n\n**Cryptid:**\n- Creates 2 copies of 1 selected card\n- This could be used to:\n  - Copy the 8 of Clubs (Mult Card) to get more +4 Mult cards\n  - Copy one of the pairs (5s or 3s) to get closer to Three of a Kind or even Four of a Kind\n  - The copies would be added to my deck permanently\n  \n**Aura:**\n- Adds an edition to a single card with permanent effects\n- Polychrome is the standout option here since X1.5 Mult scales multiplicatively with everything else I'm building\n- Holographic adds flat +10 Mult, while Foil just adds chips\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nI'm building around Three of a Kind and Two Pair synergies, with Splash ensuring all my cards contribute to the score. The Zany Joker rewards Three of a Kind specifically with +12 Mult, and I already have two pairs in hand. Polychrome on a high-value card would multiply my entire score, making it more impactful than duplicating cards at this stage. its +4 Mult enhancement AND the X1.5 Mult edition, which would multiply all my other bonuses together. A high-value card like the Queen or 10 would also benefit significantly from Polychrome.\n\nI'm leaning toward Aura as the better option. The multiplicative scaling from Polychrome will amplify my existing mult sources—Zany Joker, Mystic Summit, and the card enhancements—more effectively than adding another copy would. The 8 of Clubs seems like the ideal target since it already has +4 Mult, making the X1.5 multiplier especially potent. Polychrome multiplies the final multiplier by 1.5, making it incredibly valuable regardless of which card receives it. Since Splash ensures all cards contribute to scoring, adding it to any card guarantees that boost will always apply. I'll choose Aura at position 2.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
