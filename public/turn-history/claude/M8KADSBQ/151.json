{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Blind: Small Blind (11,000 chips needed)\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 7\n- Current chips: 0\n- Money: $34\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n2. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n3. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n5. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n6. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n7. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler: +1 hand size\n6. Green Joker: +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult), Negative edition\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Devil: Enhances 1 card into a Gold Card\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at the cards:\n- 2 of Spades, 2 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds = Three 2s (Three of a Kind!)\n- 6 of Spades, 6 of Clubs = Pair of 6s\n- King of Clubs (single)\n- 9 of Clubs (single)\n- 7 of Diamonds (single)\n\nI can play a Three of a Kind with the three 2s!\n\n\nBefore playing, I should use The Devil to enhance a card into a Gold Card for the $3 end-of-round bonus. Since Splash makes every played card count, I'll want to enhance something I keep in hand rather than play—the King of Clubs is the best candidate since it's high value and I won't need it for the Three of a Kind combo.\n\nBut I'm realizing the core issue: I need 11,000 chips this round with only 3 hands and 7 discards remaining. With my current Jokers—Splash counting all played cards, Zany giving +12 Mult to Three of a Kind, and Green Joker at +0—I should probably discard first to find better cards that actually help me reach that score threshold.\n\nLet me work through what I'd get with the three 2s I have now. Playing all eight cards with Splash would give me roughly 2,166 chips after multiplying the base hand value by my Joker multipliers. That's nowhere near the 11,000 I need, so discarding to build a stronger hand makes more sense than committing to this weak play.\n\nI should hold off on The Devil for now and focus on drawing better cards. I'll discard the low-value cards—both 2s, both 6s, and the 7—keeping the King of Clubs, 9 of Clubs, and 2 of Hearts to see what I draw next.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,6,8]"}
