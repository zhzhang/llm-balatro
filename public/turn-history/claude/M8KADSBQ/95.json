{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 9 (just finished Small Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $9\n- Next will face Big Blind, then Boss Blind\n\n**Current Jokers (5/5 - FULL):**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring (EXTREMELY POWERFUL)\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Effective Stats:**\n- Hand size: 7 (base) - 1 (Merry Andy) + 1 (Juggler) = 7 cards\n- Discards per round: 3 (base) + 3 (Merry Andy) = 6 discards\n- Hands per round: 4 (base) - 1 (Hieroglyph voucher) = 3 hands\n\n**Consumables:**\n- Pluto - Level up High Card (+1 Mult, +10 chips)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Jupiter (Planet) - Level up Flush for $3\n- Arcana Pack - $4\n- Standard Pack - $4\n- Director's Cut voucher - $10\n- Reroll - $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $9 left. My joker slots are full. Let me think about what makes sense:\n\n1. **Jupiter ($3)**: Would level up Flush. I've only played Flush once. Not my main strategy. However, it could open up flush-based hands as an option.\n\n2. **Arcana Pack ($4)**: Could get useful tarot cards to enhance playing cards or modify jokers. This could be valuable.\n\n\n3. **Standard Pack ($4)**: Adding cards to the deck might improve consistency, though I'm not sure how much I need it right now.\n\n4. **Reroll ($5)**: My joker slots are full, so I'd need to sell something first. The current setup is working well.\n\n5. **Pluto consumable**: Leveling High Card would give me 15 chips and 2 mult, but I rarely use that hand.\n\n6. **Just proceed**: Holding onto the $9 for future shops or banking interest seems reasonable.\n\nMy core strategy revolves around Three of a Kind, Two Pair, Pairs, and Full House—hands that work well with Splash since every card contributes. Zany Joker amplifies Three of a Kind with +12 Mult, and Mystic Summit rewards me when I've used all my discards. The Arcana Pack stands out because tarot cards can enhance individual cards with bonuses, multipliers, or special properties, plus modify my jokers with editions and add seals. With Big Blind and the Boss Blind coming up in Ante 3, having enhanced cards could make a real difference. Jupiter for $3 would leave me with $6 remaining, which is another option to consider.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
