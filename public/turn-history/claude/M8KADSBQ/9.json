{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: SHOP (after beating Small Blind)\n- Money: $1\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Green Joker (+1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard, currently +0 Mult)\n  2. Merry Andy (+3 discards each round, -1 hand size)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (3 slots remaining)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (2 slots remaining)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Greedy Joker - $5 (can't afford)\n2. Mega Spectral Pack - $8 (can't afford)\n3. Telescope Voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n4. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $1, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop:\n- Greedy Joker costs $5\n- Mega Spectral Pack costs $8\n- Telescope Voucher costs $10\n- Reroll costs $5\n\nAll options are out of my budget. I cannot make any purchases.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nSince I can't afford anything, my only viable option is to proceed to the next round using `round_select`. This will:\n1. Take me to the Blind Select phase\n2. Allow me to choose between Small/Big/Boss blind (or skip if available)\n3. Once I beat the Big Blind, I'll earn:\n   - $1 per remaining hand\n   - Interest on my money ($1 per $5)\n   - Blind reward money\n\nGiven that I have 2 good jokers (Green Joker for scaling and Merry Andy for extra discards), I should be well-positioned to beat the Big Blind and earn more money for future purchases.\n\n\nI need to move forward to the next blind using `round_select` since there's nothing I can purchase with my current funds.","action":"\"round_select\""}
