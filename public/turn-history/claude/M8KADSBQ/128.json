{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $1\n- I just skipped the Small Blind and received a Negative Tag\n- Now facing the Big Blind\n\n**Current Blind Options:**\n1. Big Blind: 7,500 chips needed, $4 reward, skip tag = Skip Tag ($15 if I skip)\n2. Boss Blind: 10,000 chips needed, $5 reward, must play 5 cards\n\n**My Current Setup:**\nJokers:\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nConsumables:\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card\n\nTags:\n1. Negative Tag - Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Negative\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my last played hands:\n- Straight: 4,662 chips (Ante 3 Boss)\n- Four of a Kind: 4,180 chips (Ante 3 Big)\n- Full House: 3,906 chips (Ante 3 Small)\n\nI need 7,500 chips for the Big Blind, but my best score in Ante 3 was only 4,662. That's a huge gap - I need almost 60% more chips than my best performance.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that my jokers are weak:\n- Merry Andy gives discards but reduces hand size\n- Zany Joker only gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- Splash makes all cards count (useful, but doesn't scale)\n\n\n- Mystic Summit provides +15 Mult at 0 discards, which is modest scaling\n- Juggler just adds +1 hand size\n\nMy chip generation is fundamentally too low for Ante 4. Even if I play perfectly, I'm unlikely to reach 7,500 chips.\n\n**Options:**\n1. Play the Big Blind - Very risky, likely to lose\n2. Skip the Big Blind - Get Skip Tag worth $15, go directly to Boss\n\nSkipping nets me $15 from the Skip Tag, which is substantial money. I won't access the shop before facing the Boss, but I'll have accumulated tags to work with.\n\nThe Boss demands 5 cards played, which actually works with Splash since every card matters. I need 10,000 chips to win. If I skip the Big Blind and reach the Boss, I'd have $15 plus the $5 reward and interest—roughly $21+ for the shop afterward. My Negative Tag would let me grab a free Negative joker there. However, skipping means no shop between Big Blind and Boss, so failing the Boss ends the run immediately. Given I can barely generate 7,500 chips, beating the Big Blind is already a long shot, making the direct Boss path risky but potentially more rewarding if I can pull it off. d beat the Boss, I'd get $15 + $5 plus a shop with Negative Tag—that's significantly better than beating the Big Blind and getting $4 with a shop before still facing the Boss. The Boss's five-card requirement actually works in my favor given Splash. Skipping the Big Blind and using that $15 to attempt the Boss seems like the stronger play.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
