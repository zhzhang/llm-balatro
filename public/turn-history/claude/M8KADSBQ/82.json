{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers (4/5): Merry Andy, Zany Joker, Splash, Mystic Summit\n- Consumables (1/2): The Magician\n- Voucher: Hieroglyph\n\n**Shop:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Pluto (Planet) - Level up High Card, Cost: $0 (FREE)\n  2. Misprint (Joker) - \"+.\" description, Cost: $0 (FREE)\n- Boosters: None\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Director's Cut - Cost: $10 (too expensive)\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**What's still available:**\n1. Pluto - Free planet card that levels up High Card\n2. Misprint - Free joker\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI've just completed the Standard Pack selection. Now I'm back in the shop.\n\nLooking at what I planned before:\n- I wanted to grab the Standard Pack (done)\n- I wanted to grab Misprint (still available, FREE)\n- Pluto is still there but I don't use High Card hands\n\nSince Misprint is a FREE joker and I have room for 1 more joker (4/5 slots used), I should definitely buy it. The description says \"+.\" which is cryptic, but based on Balatro knowledge, Misprint gives random mult between +0 and +23 each hand, which can be useful.\n\nAfter buying Misprint, I should check if there's anything else worth doing:\n- Pluto is free but useless since I never play High Card\n- Director's Cut costs $10 and I only have $5\n- Reroll costs $5 but I'd be left with $0\n\nMy best move is to buy Misprint (the free joker), then proceed to round select since there's nothing else valuable in the shop.\n\n\nI'll grab Misprint now since it's free and fills my last joker slot with a card that provides random multiplier boosts each hand.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
