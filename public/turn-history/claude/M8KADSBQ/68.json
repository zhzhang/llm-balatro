{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8\n- Round: 7\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $0\n- I just skipped the Big Blind and received the Coupon Tag\n\n**Current Blind:**\n- Boss Blind: 800 chips needed\n- Boss Description: Play only 1 hand (meaning I get exactly ONE attempt)\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Magician - Enhances 2 selected cards to Lucky Cards\n\n**Tags:**\n1. Coupon Tag - Initial cards and booster packs in next shop are free\n\n**My Recent Performance:**\n- Three of a Kind - 1,818 chips\n- Three of a Kind - 2,480 chips\n- Pair - 840 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm now at the Boss Blind which only allows me to play 1 hand. I need to score 800 chips in that single hand.\n\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- Three of a Kind hands have scored 1,818 and 2,480 chips - well above 800\n- Even a Pair scored 840 chips - just above 800\n\nThe key question is: Should I use The Magician BEFORE starting the round to enhance 2 cards to Lucky Cards?\n\nWait, I can't use The Magician right now because I'm in BLIND_SELECT phase, not in a round with cards in hand. The Magician requires me to select target cards, which I can only do when I'm in the ROUND phase with cards dealt.\n\nSo my only option right now is to use the `play_round` command to start the Boss Blind.\n\n\nOnce the round begins, I'll assess my hand and decide whether to apply The Magician to boost two cards with Lucky effects. Given that I only get one attempt, I need to maximize my score—either by forming a strong Three of a Kind or using the consumable strategically to increase my odds. The command to execute is: `play_round`","action":"\"play_round\""}
