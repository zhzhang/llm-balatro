{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state to determine the best action.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase after buying a Celestial Pack\n- I need to choose one of three planet cards:\n  1. Pluto - Levels up High Card (+1 Mult, +10 chips)\n  2. Mars - Levels up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult, +30 chips)\n  3. Mercury - Levels up Pair (+1 Mult, +15 chips)\n\n**Hand Play History:**\nLooking at my last played hands:\n- Straight: Played 2 times (most recent: 486 chips)\n- Three of a Kind: Played 1 time (300 chips)\n- Pair: Played 1 time (180 chips)\n- Two Pair: Played 1 time (162 chips)\n- Flush: Played 1 time (280 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +3 Mult (scales with hands played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size (helps me fish for better hands)\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Analysis of Planet Card Options:**\n\n1. **Pluto (High Card)**: High Card is generally not a strong hand type to invest in. It's only useful as a fallback when you can't make anything else. I haven't played a single High Card hand yet.\n\n2. **Mars (Four of a Kind)**: Four of a Kind is a strong hand but difficult to assemble consistently. It currently has 60 base chips and 7 base mult at level 1. Leveling it would give +30 chips and +3 mult, making it 90 chips and 10 mult. However, I haven't played a Four of a Kind yet, and with Merry Andy reducing my hand size to 6 cards, it's harder to draw into four of the same rank.\n\n\n3. **Mercury (Pair)**: Pair is the most reliable option since I've already played it and can consistently make it. Leveling it from 10 chips and 2 mult to 25 chips and 3 mult provides solid scaling for a hand I'll use repeatedly. Pairs are easy to assemble and serve as a dependable fallback throughout the run.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nEntering Ante 2 means chip requirements will escalate quickly. My Zany Joker synergizes best with Three of a Kind, but that's not available here. Mercury offers the most practical value since Pair is a hand I can reliably execute with my current setup.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
