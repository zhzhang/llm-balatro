{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small (800 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 744 (need only 56 more chips!)\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 6\n- Current Money: $3\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n7. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: Currently +4 Mult\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at the cards:\n- I have TWO PAIRS: pair of Kings (King of Spades, King of Hearts) and pair of 10s (10 of Spades, 10 of Clubs)\n- Ranks: King, 10, 4, King, 10, 8, Ace\n- Suits: Spades, Spades, Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Clubs, Diamonds\n\n**Best hand available:** Two Pair (Kings and 10s)\n\nI only need 56 more chips to win! This is extremely close.\n\n**Scoring calculation for Two Pair:**\n- Two Pair is Level 1: 20 base chips, 2 base mult\n- Green Joker: +4 mult\n\n\n- Splash: All played cards count\n- Total mult: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nPlaying the two pair with the Ace gives me 20 base chips plus 51 from the cards (10+10+10+10+11), totaling 71 chips multiplied by 6 for 426 points. That's far more than the 56 I need to finish this round.\n\nI could simplify further with just a pair of Kings at Level 2 (25 base chips, 3 mult) plus the Green Joker's +4 mult. Adding the Ace and two 10s gives 76 total chips times 7 mult equals 532 points—also easily sufficient. Even a basic hand would work here.\n\nTwo pair is the stronger option though. I'll play Kings and 10s with the Ace kicker using cards at positions 1, 4, 2, 5, and 7, which should score around 426 chips.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,2,5,7]"}
