{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n4. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n5. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n6. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- I have K-Q-J-10 of Spades - this is 4 cards toward a royal flush!\n- I also have 4 of Spades (5 Spades total = Flush)\n- I have two Queens (Q♠ and Q♦)\n- I have two 4s (4♠ and 4♣)\n- Remaining: 3 hands to play, 5 discards\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n1. **Flush (5 Spades)**: K♠, Q♠, J♠, 10♠, 4♠\n   - Base: 50 chips (Level 2) + 6 mult (Level 2)\n   - With Splash, all 5 cards contribute: 10+10+10+10+4 = 44 chips\n   - Total chips: (50 + 44) = 94 chips\n   - Mult: 6 base + 15 (Mystic Summit if I use all discards) = 21 mult\n   - Total: 94 × 21 = 1,974 chips (not enough!)\n\n2. **Straight (K-Q-J-10-?)**: Need a 9 or Ace\n   - Looking at deck, there are 2 nines and 4 aces available\n   - If I can get a 9 or Ace of Spades, I'd have a Straight Flush!\n   \n3. **Two Pair (Queens and 4s)**: Q♠, Q♦, 4♠, 4♣ only yields 20 base chips with 2 mult - insufficient power even with Splash across all 8 cards.\n\n**Best Strategy:**\nThe K-Q-J-10 of Spades sequence is my strongest asset. Drawing a 9 of Spades or Ace of Spades would complete a Straight Flush (100 base chips + 8 mult), which is significantly more powerful than the flush alone. With 2 nines and 4 aces still in the deck, I have reasonable odds of hitting one of these cards.\n\nI should discard the weak cards (4♣, Q♦, 2♦) to maximize my chances of drawing into the straight. Even a regular Straight (60 chips + 7 mult) would be a solid improvement over my current position.\n\nSplash fundamentally changes the calculation since every card I play contributes to scoring. This means I need to evaluate whether playing all 8 cards with a weaker hand beats playing fewer cards with a stronger hand. The Straight Flush draw seems like the optimal path - I'm discarding three weak cards and banking on drawing one of the seven remaining Spades that would complete my sequence. With Splash, every card contributes chips but the hand type is determined by the best poker combination. Playing all 8 cards gives me a Flush (5 Spades) worth 50 base chips and 6 multiplier. The five spade cards contribute 44 chips, while Splash adds the remaining three cards for another 16 chips, totaling 110 chips × 6 = 660—still far too low without additional multipliers.\n\nI should activate Mystic Summit instead, which grants +15 mult when I have zero discards remaining. Since I have 5 discards left, I need to use all of them before playing my hand. Alternatively, I could pursue a straight by drawing either a 9 or an Ace to complete K-Q-J-10-9 or A-K-Q-J-10, which might yield better scoring potential.\n\nLet me discard the low-value cards that don't contribute to my flush or straight possibilities. I'll get rid of 4♣, Q♦, and 2♦ to try drawing into a 9 or Ace, while keeping the 4♠ since it supports my flush draw.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [6,7,8]"}
