{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n2. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n3. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult enhancement)\n4. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n5. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips, +4 Mult enhancement)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Available Hands:**\n- Pair of Kings (positions 1, 6)\n\n**Resources:**\n- 4 hands remaining\n- 5 discards remaining\n- Need 2,000 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: Currently +0 Mult (decreases by 1 with each discard, increases by 1 with each hand played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Deck Information:**\n- 35 cards remaining\n- 2 Kings remaining in deck\n- Still no Three of a Kind\n\nI've been trying to get a Three of a Kind to activate Zany Joker's +12 Mult, but I'm running out of discards. Let me calculate what I can score with what I have:\n\n**If I play Pair of Kings (positions 1, 6):**\n- Base Pair: 25 chips, 3 mult\n- Cards in scoring: King of Hearts (10), King of Diamonds (10)\n- With Splash, all played cards count\n- If I play all 7 cards with the pair:\n  - Base chips: 25\n  - King of Hearts: +10\n  - King of Diamonds: +10\n  - 8 of Clubs: +8\n  - Queen of Diamonds: +10\n  - 7 of Clubs: +7\n  - 4 of Hearts: +4\n  - 2 of Clubs: +2\n  - Total chips: 76\n\nMultiplier breakdown: Base mult of 3 from the pair, plus 4 from King of Diamonds enhancement, plus 4 from 8 of Clubs enhancement, and Green Joker contributes its current value.\n\nThis gives me 11 total multiplier, resulting in 76 × 11 = 836 chips. I'm still far from the 2,000 target. With 5 discards and 4 hands left, I should continue pursuing a Three of a Kind since there are still 2 Kings in the deck. I'll keep the two Kings and discard the rest to hunt for the third one, though the odds are slim. But I'm also wondering if there's a better approach if the Kings don't come through.\n\nActually, I could leverage Mystic Summit's +15 multiplier bonus when I have 0 discards remaining. If I exhaust my discards strategically and play my final hand, I'd get base 3 mult plus the King bonuses, Green Joker at -4 (adjusted from -5), and Mystic Summit at +15, totaling 22 multiplier. That would give me 76 × 22 = 1,672 chips—still short of 2,000. The Three of a Kind remains my best shot, so I'll keep discarding to find that third King.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,7]"}
