{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8\n- Round: 7\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $0\n\n**Current Blind Options:**\n1. Big Blind: 1200 chips needed, Reward $4\n   - Skip for Coupon Tag (free initial cards and boosters in next shop)\n2. Upcoming Boss Blind: 800 chips needed, Reward $5\n   - Boss Description: Play only 1 hand\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Magician - Enhances 2 selected cards to Lucky Cards\n\n**My Recent Performance:**\n- Three of a Kind - 1,818 chips (Ante 3, Small Blind)\n- Pair - 840 chips (Ante 3, Small Blind)\n- Three of a Kind - 2,480 chips (Ante 2, Boss)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Big Blind requires 1200 chips. Looking at my recent hands:\n- I scored 1,818 chips on a Three of a Kind\n- I scored 2,480 chips on a Three of a Kind (Boss fight)\n- I scored 840 chips on a Pair\n\nThe Boss Blind coming up is particularly challenging - \"Play only 1 hand\" - which means I get exactly ONE hand to score 800 chips. This is a very restrictive boss effect.\n\nWith Hieroglyph, I have -1 hand each round, so I might have very limited hands for the Big Blind too.\n\nLet me think about the decision:\n\n**Option 1: Play the Big Blind**\n\n\nMy Three of a Kind hands have consistently exceeded 1200 chips, so I should clear this threshold. After winning, I'd face the Boss with limited hands due to my hand size penalty. The $4 reward helps, but the real challenge is the single-hand Boss fight afterward.\n\n**Option 2: Skip for Coupon Tag**\nI'd skip directly to the Boss Blind and gain shop benefits. Since my recent Three of a Kind hands scored 1,800-2,480 chips, hitting 800 in one hand seems achievable. I could use The Magician to enhance cards before the boss fight, maximizing my single hand's potential.\n\nThe Boss Blind's 800-chip requirement with one hand is actually less demanding than the Big Blind's 1200-chip requirement. Skipping the Big Blind nets me the Coupon Tag for free shop items and boosters, while the Boss fight plays to my Three of a Kind strength. This is the better path forward.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
