{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 11\n- Boss Blind: \"First hand is drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 7\n- Money: $0\n\n**Hand:**\nAll 8 cards are face down (Unknown). This is the boss effect - the first hand is drawn face down.\n\n**Key Information:**\n- I have Merry Andy which gives +3 discards and -1 hand size\n- I have Hieroglyph which gives -1 hand per round\n- So I have 3 hands and 7 discards available\n- I have Splash which makes every played card count in scoring\n- I have Mystic Summit which gives +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n- I have Zany Joker which gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n- I have Juggler which gives +1 hand size (so I have 8 cards in hand instead of 7)\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince I can't see my cards, I need to discard to reveal them. With 7 discards available, I have plenty of room to discard and draw new cards to see what I'm working with.\n\nThe best approach is to:\n1. Discard some/all cards to reveal what I have\n2. Then make informed decisions about what hands to play\n\nSince I have 7 discards and only 3 hands to play, I should use my first discard to reveal the cards and see what I'm working with.\n\nI could discard all 8 cards (well, up to 5 at a time), but that might not be necessary. Let me discard 5 cards first to see what I draw.\n\nActually, wait - I should think about this more carefully. After I discard, I'll draw new cards which will be face up. \n\nDiscarding will let me see what I'm actually working with. Looking at my previous hands - Four of a Kind scored 4,180 and Full House hit 3,906 - I need something strong to reach 4000. Since Splash counts every card toward scoring, I should focus on building a high-value combination. Let me start by discarding 5 cards to reveal my options.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
