{"reasoning":"Looking at the current situation, I notice something strange - the game state hasn't changed between turns 57 and 58, and now in the current state. The hand is identical:\n\n1. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n2. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n3. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult enhancement)\n4. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n5. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips, +4 Mult enhancement)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\nThe discard commands I attempted in turns 57 and 58 don't seem to have taken effect. This is likely because I have 7 cards in hand but my actual hand size is 6 (Merry Andy gives -1 hand size). So I can't properly select cards to discard - the game won't let me.\n\nLet me analyze what I can do:\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- 4 hands remaining\n- 5 discards remaining\n- Need 2000 chips\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +0 Mult (increases by 1 per play, decreases by 1 per discard)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Pair of Kings (positions 1, 6)\n- 2 Kings left in deck out of 35 cards\n\n**What I can do:**\n\nOption 1: Play the pair of Kings with all supporting cards using Splash\n- Base: 25 chips, 3 mult\n- Cards: King of Hearts (10), 4 of Hearts (4), 8 of Clubs (8), 7 of Clubs (7), 2 of Clubs (2), King of Diamonds (10), Queen of Diamonds (10)\n\n\n- Total chips: 76 chips\n- Mult: 3 (base) + 4 (King of Diamonds) + 4 (8 of Clubs) + 0 (Green Joker) = 11 mult\n- Total: 76 × 11 = 836 chips\n\nThis falls well short of 2000 chips.\n\nOption 2: Burn through all remaining discards to trigger Mystic Summit's +15 Mult bonus, then play. After 5 discards, Green Joker would drop to -5 Mult, which would severely hurt my scoring potential.\n\nWith Mystic Summit activated, the multiplier becomes 3 + 4 + 4 - 5 + 15 = 21 mult, giving 76 × 21 = 1,596 chips. Still insufficient.\n\nOption 3: Pursue a Three of a Kind by finding another King. A three-of-a-kind would generate 50 base chips with 5 mult, and Splash would count all cards in hand. The calculation gets complicated depending on which cards actually play, so I need to work through the exact hand composition.\n\nWith three Kings plus the 8 of Clubs and Queen, I'd have 98 chips and 26 mult (5 base + 12 from Zany Joker + 4 from King of Diamonds + 4 from 8 of Clubs + 1 from Green Joker), totaling 2,548 chips. This would be viable, but finding that third King only has about a 5.7% chance per discard. I'm also noticing my hand hasn't changed despite multiple discard attempts over the last few turns, suggesting the game might not be registering my commands—possibly because I'm holding 7 cards when the hand limit is lower.\n\nSince my discards aren't working, I should just play my current cards and accumulate chips across multiple hands. Playing the pair of Kings with my highest-value cards would give me 836 chips, leaving me needing 1,164 more from my remaining three hands, which feels achievable. With Splash active, playing all available cards maximizes my scoring potential, though I'm limited to 5 cards per hand. (both Kings, 8 of Clubs, Queen, and 7 of Clubs).","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,4,6,7]"}
