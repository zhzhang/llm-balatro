{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed\n- Boss Effect: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Money: $0\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +2 Mult currently (increases with hands played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm at the Boss Blind which requires 600 chips. The boss effect debuffs all Heart cards, which means any Hearts in my hand won't contribute their chip values or abilities, but they can still participate in forming a hand type.\n\nMy strategy has been focused on playing Three of a Kind hands, which synergizes well with:\n- Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n- Splash (all played cards count)\n- Green Joker (increases mult per hand played)\n\nLet me estimate if I can beat this boss:\n\nExample hand with Three of a Kind:\n- Play 3 non-Heart cards of same rank (e.g., three 10s) + 2 non-Heart cards\n- Three 10s = 30 chips\n- Two other cards (say, Jacks) = 20 chips\n- Total from cards: 50 chips\n- Base chips for Three of a Kind: 30\n- Total chips: 80\n\nMultiplier calculation:\n- Base mult for Three of a Kind: 3\n- Green Joker: +2\n- Zany Joker: +12\n- Total mult: 17\n\nTotal score: 80 × 17 = 1,360 chips\n\nThis is more than enough to beat 600 chips! Even if some of my cards are Hearts (debuffed), I should still be able to form Three of a Kind with non-Heart cards and score well.\n\n\nMerry Andy's extra discards give me flexibility to dig for Three of a Kind combinations while avoiding Hearts. I have to play this blind, so I'll proceed with `play_round`.","action":"\"play_round\""}
