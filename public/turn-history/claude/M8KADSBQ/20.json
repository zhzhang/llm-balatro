{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 3 (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Boss Effect: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining Hands: 4\n- Remaining Discards: 7\n- Money: $0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades - +11 chips\n2. 9 of Spades - +9 chips\n3. King of Hearts - Debuffed (scores no chips)\n4. 3 of Clubs - +3 chips\n5. Jack of Diamonds - +10 chips\n6. 8 of Diamonds - +8 chips\n7. 7 of Diamonds - +7 chips\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +2 Mult currently (increases +1 per hand played, decreases -1 per discard)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my current hand, I don't see any pairs or three of a kind. The best hand I can make is:\n- High Card (just the Ace)\n- Or I could try a straight with 7-8-9-Jack (but Jack is 11, so this won't work)\n\nWait, let me check for possible hands:\n- No pairs\n- No three of a kind\n- Can I make a straight? 7-8-9... no 10, and Jack is 11. No straight.\n- Flush? I have 3 Diamonds (Jack, 8, 7) and 2 Spades (Ace, 9). Not enough for a flush.\n\nI should discard some cards to try to get a Three of a Kind, since that's what my jokers are optimized for (Zany Joker gives +12 Mult for Three of a Kind).\n\n\nThe King of Hearts is useless due to the debuff, so that's an immediate discard. With 7 discards available, I can afford to cycle through several cards looking for matching ranks. I have three remaining copies each of 9, Jack, and Ace in the deck, so discarding my current copies of these could help me draw into trips.\n\nMy strategy is to keep high-value cards like the Ace of Spades, Jack of Diamonds, and 9 of Spades while discarding lower-scoring cards and the debuffed King to maximize my chances of drawing into pairs or three of a kind. 8 of Diamonds (position 6) - medium value, 7 of Diamonds (position 7) - medium-low value, and 9 of Spades (position 2) - medium value.\n\nI'll keep the Ace of Spades and Jack of Diamonds, then draw 5 new cards for a total of 7. Discarding the maximum number gives me the best shot at improving my hand toward a Three of a Kind.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,7]"}
