{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers (5/5 - FULL): \n  1. Merry Andy (+3 discards, -1 hand size)\n  2. Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind)\n  3. Splash (all played cards count)\n  4. Mystic Summit (+15 Mult when 0 discards)\n  5. Misprint (+random mult)\n- Consumables (1/2): The Magician (enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards)\n- Voucher: Hieroglyph (-1 Ante, -1 hand each round)\n\n**Shop:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Pluto (Planet) - Level up High Card, Cost: $0 (FREE)\n- Boosters: None\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Director's Cut - Cost: $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI've just bought Misprint (the free joker), and now my joker slots are full (5/5).\n\nWhat's left in the shop:\n1. Pluto - Free planet card that levels up High Card\n2. Director's Cut - $10 voucher (too expensive)\n3. Reroll - $5 (would leave me with $0)\n\n**Should I take Pluto?**\n- It's FREE\n- It levels up High Card (+1 Mult and +10 chips)\n- I have NEVER played High Card (0 times played)\n- I focus on Three of a Kind, Two Pair, and Pair\n- High Card is my fallback hand type that I don't actively use\n\nEven though I don't actively play High Card, it's a FREE upgrade. However, since I need to have targets to use The Magician consumable on (it enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards), and since I have a consumable slot available (1/2), I could potentially buy it if it appears.\n\n\n---\n\nMy core strategy revolves around Three of a Kind with Zany Joker, Two Pair, and Pair plays, with Splash ensuring all cards contribute. Pluto would upgrade High Card, which I rarely trigger since it's just my fallback option. Taking a free upgrade seems logical, but I'm approaching the Big Blind and Boss Blind for this ante, so I should focus on what directly strengthens my primary hands rather than investing in a hand type I don't actively use. The free Pluto is worth taking since it has no cost and provides a potential backup. I haven't used The Magician yet, and while it could boost high-value cards with lucky effects—either +20 Mult or a $20 win—I should wait until I see my next hand before deciding where to apply it. For now, I'll grab Pluto and move forward to round select.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
