{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- Just completed Small Blind (800 chips needed)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: Currently +5 Mult (increases with hands played, decreases with discards)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- The Tower (Tarot): Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank/suit) - Cost: $3\n- Raised Fist (Joker): Adds double the rank of lowest ranked card held in hand to Mult - Cost: $5\n- Arcana Pack x2: Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards - Cost: $4 each\n- Tarot Merchant (Voucher): Tarot cards appear 2x more frequently - Cost: $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $7 to spend. Let me evaluate my options:\n\n1. **Buy The Tower ($3)**: Stone cards give +50 chips with no rank/suit. This could be useful with Splash since all cards count. However, Stone cards lose their rank/suit, which might hurt if I need specific hand types.\n\n2. **Buy Raised Fist ($5)**: This adds double the rank of lowest card held in hand to Mult. With 7 cards in hand (Merry Andy reduces hand size by 1), the lowest card could be a 2-4. That would be +4 to +8 mult, which is decent but not amazing. With my current setup, Green Joker is already providing +5 mult and growing.\n\n\n3. **Arcana Pack ($4)** could give me access to Planet cards to level up my hands or other Tarot effects that might synergize better. **Reroll ($5)** is another option to see if better jokers appear. I could also save my money and move forward to preserve resources for the next shop. Looking at my hand progression—Pair at Level 2, Two Pair and Three of a Kind both still low—I need to think about what will scale best going forward.\n\nSince I've been relying heavily on Pair and Two Pair, getting a Planet card to boost Two Pair's chips and multiplier would be solid. My current joker setup has Green Joker scaling well and Splash providing consistency, but Zany Joker hasn't been as useful since Three of a Kind rarely comes up. With one joker slot still available, I should prioritize either getting a Planet card through the Arcana Pack or finding a joker that works better with my actual hand frequency. The Tower could free up a slot, but I need to weigh whether that's worth $3 when I could use those funds for something more directly beneficial to my current hands.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
