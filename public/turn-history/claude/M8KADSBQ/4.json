With 4 discards available, I could try to build towards:\\n\\n\\n- A flush (need 5 cards of same suit)\\n- A straight\\n- Three of a kind or better\\n\\nI have 4 clubs already, so if I discard the non-club cards (4 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts), I'd draw 4 new cards with a solid chance of completing a flush. A flush scores 35 base chips, which is much stronger than what I'm seeing now.\\n\\nLet me work through the math: if I land a clubs flush with King, 10, 7, 3 plus one more club, I'm looking at roughly 35 base chips plus 30-40 from the cards themselves, giving me 65-75 total chips multiplied by 4 for a score around 260-300. That's close to what I need, but it depends on drawing that fifth club.\\n\\nThe pair of 7s alone won't cut it. I need to think about my remaining hands\\u2014I have 4 total to work with, so averaging 75 chips per hand would get me to 300 total.\\n\\nI should discard the weaker cards and chase a flush. Dropping the 4 of Spades, 9 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, and 2 of Hearts keeps my four clubs intact and gives me a shot at completing the flush with a fifth club draw.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 3]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: Ace of Spades.

Playing two pair with 10s and 3s (positions 2, 4, 6, 8) gives 26 chips \\u00d7 2 mult = 52 chips.\\n\\nThe strongest two pair option is Aces and 10s at 124 chips, which still seems underwhelming compared to what I might achieve with other hand types.\\n\\nTo reach 300 total, I'd need roughly 59 chips per hand across my remaining attempts. I have four clubs in hand, so pursuing a flush is worth exploring. A complete five-card clubs flush would score around 288 chips\\u2014nearly at my target\\u2014but depends on drawing that fifth club. Let me reconsider my approach more broadly. cards remaining: 40 cards\\n- Probability of drawing at least 1 club when drawing 4 cards is quite high with 9 clubs still in the deck.\\n\\nChasing the flush seems like the stronger play. If I hit it, that single hand gets me to 288 chips, leaving just 12 chips needed across my final 3 hands\\u2014a much more comfortable position than trying to grind out 59 chips per hand with the pair.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 4]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: King of Hearts.

Let me calculate what a clubs flush would give me:\\n\\nOption 1: Try to complete clubs flush by discarding non-clubs\\nIf I discard positions 1, 2, 3, 8 (King of Hearts, Jack of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds), I'd draw 4 new cards and hope one is a club.\\n- 9 clubs remaining in 36 cards\\n- Drawing 4 cards, probability of getting at least 1 club is quite high\\n\\nIf I complete a clubs flush with 5 clubs:\\n- Base chips for flush: 35\\n- Let's say I get King, 10, 7, 3 of Clubs plus one more club (average value ~7)\\n\\n\\n- Total would be around 72 chips with a 4x multiplier, giving me 288 chips\\u2014nearly enough to finish the blind in a single hand.\\n\\nOption 2: Play two pair with Kings and Jacks (positions 1, 2, 4, 8)\\n- Base chips for two pair: 20\\n- Chips from cards: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\\n- Total chips: 60\\n- Base mult for two pair: 2\\n- Total score: 120 chips\\n\\nThat's solid but I'd still need 180 more chips spread across the remaining hands.\\n\\nOption 3: Play the 4 clubs I have now for a flush (positions 4, 5, 6, 7)\\nWait, I need 5 cards to play a hand. Let me recalculate.\\n\\nIf I play positions 4, 5, 6, 7 (King, 10, 7, 3 of Clubs) plus one more card, I only have 4 clubs so it wouldn't be a flush.\\n\\nActually, I need to be more careful. I can only play UP TO 5 cards. With 4 clubs, I could:\\n- Play just the 4 clubs (4, 5, 6, 7) - but that's only 4 cards,\\n\\nwhich wouldn't form a flush (need 5)\\n- Add a fifth card that's not a club - then it's not a flush either\\n\\nSo I can't play a flush right now with only 4 clubs.\\n\\nLet me reconsider my options:\\n\\n1. Discard non-clubs (1, 2, 3, 8) to try to draw a 5th club for a flush\\n2. Play the two pair (Kings and Jacks) for 120 chips\\n\\nGiven that I have 4 hands remaining and only 2 discards, I think the flush chase is still the best strategy. If I hit it, I get ~288 chips in one hand. If I don't, I can fall back to playing pairs/two pairs with my remaining hands.\\n\\nLet me go with discarding the non-clubs to chase the flush.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 8\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 1\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers: None\\nMax Jokers: 5\\nOwned Consumeables: None\\nMax Consumeables: 2\\nOwned Tags: None\\nOwned Vouchers: None\\nCurrent Money: $4\\n## Current Round Info\\nCurrent Blind: Small.\\nChips Needed: 300\\nHand:\\n1: Name: 10 of Spades.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current game state:\n\nCurrent Hand:\n1: 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2: 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n3: King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4: 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5: 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6: 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7: 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8: 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n\nI need 300 chips total.\nRemaining hands: 4\nRemaining discards: 1\nCurrent chips: 0\n\nLooking at my hand:\n- Pair of 10s: positions 1 and 4 (10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs)\n- Pair of 3s: positions 2 and 7 (3 of Hearts and 3 of Clubs)\n- Clubs: positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (King, 10, 7, 5, 3, 2 of Clubs) - that's 6 clubs!\n\nExcellent! I have 6 clubs, so I can definitely play a 5-card flush now!\n\nLet me calculate the flush:\nI should play 5 of my 6 clubs. The best 5 would be the ones with highest chip values.\n- King of Clubs: +10\n- 10 of Clubs: +10\n- 7 of Clubs: +7\n- 5 of Clubs: +5\n- 3 of Clubs: +3\n\nTotal chips from cards: 10 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 35 chips\nBase chips for flush: 35 chips\nTotal chips: 35 + 35 = 70 chips\nBase mult for flush: 4\n\n\nTotal score: 70 × 4 = 280 chips\n\nThat gets me to 280 chips—just 20 short of my goal with three hands remaining, which is easily manageable. I could swap the 3 of Clubs for the 2 instead, but that only drops me to 276 chips, so the original combination is better.\n\nThe King, 10, 7, 5, and 3 of Clubs is my strongest play. Let me verify this follows the scoring rules correctly: since all five cards form the flush, every card's chip value contributes to the total. The flush base is 35 chips, plus the card values of 10 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 35, giving 70 chips before the 4× multiplier."
