{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\nCurrent Hand:\n1: 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2: 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n3: King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4: 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5: 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6: 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7: 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8: 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n\nI need 300 chips total.\nRemaining hands: 4\nRemaining discards: 1\nCurrent chips: 0\n\nLooking at my hand:\n- Pair of 10s: positions 1 and 4 (10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs)\n- Pair of 3s: positions 2 and 7 (3 of Hearts and 3 of Clubs)\n- Clubs: positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (King, 10, 7, 5, 3, 2 of Clubs) - that's 6 clubs!\n\nExcellent! I have 6 clubs, so I can definitely play a 5-card flush now!\n\nLet me calculate the flush:\nI should play 5 of my 6 clubs. The best 5 would be the ones with highest chip values.\n- King of Clubs: +10\n- 10 of Clubs: +10\n- 7 of Clubs: +7\n- 5 of Clubs: +5\n- 3 of Clubs: +3\n\nTotal chips from cards: 10 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 35 chips\nBase chips for flush: 35 chips\nTotal chips: 35 + 35 = 70 chips\nBase mult for flush: 4\n\n\nTotal score: 70 × 4 = 280 chips\n\nThat gets me to 280 chips—just 20 short of my goal with three hands remaining, which is easily manageable. I could swap the 3 of Clubs for the 2 instead, but that only drops me to 276 chips, so the original combination is better.\n\nThe King, 10, 7, 5, and 3 of Clubs is my strongest play. Let me verify this follows the scoring rules correctly: since all five cards form the flush, every card's chip value contributes to the total. The flush base is 35 chips, plus the card values of 10 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 35, giving 70 chips before the 4× multiplier.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,7]"}
