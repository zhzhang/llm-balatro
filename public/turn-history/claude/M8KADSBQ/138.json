{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 2,997\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 0\n- Money: $36\n\n**Chips needed to win:** 10,000 - 2,997 = 7,003 more chips with 2 hands remaining\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n3. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult from enhancement, +10 Mult from holo edition = +14 Mult total)\n5. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining (ACTIVE NOW since discards = 0)\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nI now have 0 discards remaining, so Mystic Summit is active for +15 Mult!\n\nLooking at my hand:\n- THREE 8s: 8♣, 8♦, 8♦ - This is a Three of a Kind!\n- I also have King, Jack, 10 of Clubs, which could form a straight if I had a 9 or Queen of Clubs (but I don't)\n\n\n- I'm one Club short of a Flush with King, Jack, 10, and 8 of Clubs\n\nPlaying the Three of a Kind with the highest remaining cards (King and Queen) gives me: 8♣, 8♦, 8♦, King♣, Queen♦. This yields 50 base chips from the Three of a Kind plus 44 chips from all five cards counting via Splash.\n\nWith multipliers from Zany Joker (+12), the 8 of Clubs enhancement (+4), its holo edition (+10), and Mystic Summit at zero discards (+15), I get a total multiplier of 46. That's 94 × 46 = 4,324 chips, bringing my running total to 7,321. I'd need 2,679 more from my final hand to reach the goal.\n\nA flush won't work since I only have 4 Clubs. But I can make a Straight with King, Queen, Jack, 10, and 9 of Diamonds. Let me work through the scoring: the base is 60 chips for a Level 2 Straight, and with Splash counting all five cards, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 additional chips.\n\nThat gives 109 total chips. With a base multiplier of 7 and Mystic Summit adding 15 (since I have no discards left), I get 22 Mult, resulting in 2,398 chips. This is much worse than the Three of a Kind. I should go with the Three of a Kind instead, selecting the three 8s as the core, then adding the King of Clubs and Queen of Diamonds for their chip values.\n\nPlaying cards at positions 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 should yield around 4,324 chips. That brings my total to 7,321, leaving me needing 2,679 more chips from the final hand while Mystic Summit remains available.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,5,7,8]"}
