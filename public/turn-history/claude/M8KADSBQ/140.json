{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $46\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 5 jokers)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 1)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult), NEGATIVE EDITION (+1 Joker slot), Cost: $0 (FREE!)\n2. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card, Cost: $3\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Celestial Pack - $4\n2. Jumbo Spectral Pack - $6\n\n**Voucher:**\n1. Magic Trick - Playing cards can be purchased from shop, Cost: $10\n\n**Key Observation:**\nThe Green Joker is FREE and has a NEGATIVE EDITION which gives +1 Joker slot! This is incredibly valuable. Even though I already have 5 jokers at max capacity, the Negative edition will increase my max jokers to 6, allowing me to keep all my current jokers and add this one.\n\nThe Negative Tag I had in my previous turns is now gone (it was used to make this Green Joker free and negative).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. Green Joker with Negative edition is an absolute must-buy at $0. It increases my joker capacity and provides scaling Mult (+1 per hand played, -1 per discard). Since I have Merry Andy giving me +3 discards, I will be using discards, so the -1 Mult per discard is a concern. However, the +1 joker slot is invaluable, and I can manage the Mult scaling.\n\n\n2. The Devil could convert a card to Gold for $3, generating $3 at round end, but it's not essential. The Celestial Pack at $4 might level up frequently-used hands like Three of a Kind or Straight. Jumbo Spectral Pack costs $6 and offers unpredictable spectral effects. Magic Trick at $10 lets me purchase cards from the shop, which could help with deck refinement but seems less urgent. The Green Joker is clearly the priority here.\n\nWith $46 left after grabbing the Green Joker, I'm weighing whether to invest in the Celestial Pack now to boost Three of a Kind or Straight—both hands I've relied on—or hold resources. Since I'm at Ante 5/8 and chip requirements will spike considerably, I need to think about whether immediate hand leveling or preserving capital matters more at this stage.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
