{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $3\n- Current Blind: Big Blind - needs 1200 chips, reward $4\n- Option to skip for: Holographic Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic)\n- Upcoming Blind: Boss - needs 1600 chips, reward $5, Boss effect: \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +5 Mult (scales with hands played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size (so I have 7 cards in hand)\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. One slot available\n\n**Enhanced Cards:**\n- King of Diamonds and 8 of Clubs are now Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Two Pair - 497 chips (last hand from Small Blind which needed 800 chips)\n- Two Pair - 366 chips\n- Pair - 378 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me evaluate whether I should play or skip the Big Blind:\n\n**If I Play:**\n- Need 1200 chips\n- My recent hands have been scoring 366-497 chips\n- With Splash, all my cards count, including the two Mult Cards\n- I have 4 hands and 7 discards (3+3 from Merry Andy, +1 default)\n- Looking at my performance, I've been consistently hitting 300-500 chip hands\n- I'd need about 2-3 hands to reach 1200 chips\n- Reward: $4, bringing me to $7\n\n**If I Skip:**\n- Get Holographic Tag: next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic\n\n\n- The Holographic edition adds +10 Mult to that joker, making it worth roughly $5+ in value\n- But I'd skip the shop entirely and face the Boss blind directly\n- Boss needs 1600 chips with cards drawn face down—I won't see what I'm pulling\n- My current scoring pace seems reliable enough to handle the Big Blind\n\nLet me recalculate what I'm actually generating: Two Pair gives 20 chips and 2 mult as the base. The paired cards themselves contribute around 16-20 chips total. Green Joker multiplies everything by 5, and Splash counts all 5 cards played, including the Mult Cards worth +4 each. That puts me closer to 570 chips with proper setup—still short of 1600, so I need to reconsider my approach. The Holographic Tag is tempting since it grants a free Holographic joker worth +10 mult, but skipping means facing the Boss blind immediately without a shop visit. The Boss's face-down card mechanic makes it significantly harder to construct specific hands, which is a major disadvantage.\n\nI should play the Big Blind instead. I can handle it with my current setup, earn the $4 to reach $7, and crucially, get to shop before encountering the Boss. Since the Boss requires 1600 chips and removes visibility of my draws, I need to maximize my joker synergies beforehand.\n\nMy recent hands have consistently hit 366-497 chips, so averaging 300 per hand across four hands to reach 1200 is realistic. With seven discards available, I have plenty of flexibility to find strong combinations even if early hands underperform.","action":"\"play_round\""}
