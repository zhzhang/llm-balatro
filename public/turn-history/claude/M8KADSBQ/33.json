{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $3\n- Just used The Empress to enhance 2 cards (King of Diamonds and 8 of Clubs) to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +5 Mult (grows with hands played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n- 1 joker slot available\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- The Tower (Tarot): Enhances 1 card into Stone Card (+50 chips) - Cost: $3\n- Raised Fist (Joker): Adds double the rank of lowest ranked card held in hand to Mult - Cost: $5\n- Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards - Cost: $4\n- Tarot Merchant (Voucher): Tarot cards appear 2x more frequently - Cost: $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $3, so my options are:\n1. Buy The Tower ($3) - Would use all my money\n2. Save money and move to round select\n3. Can't afford: Raised Fist ($5), Arcana Pack ($4), Reroll ($5), Tarot Merchant ($10)\n\n**The Tower Evaluation:**\n- Enhances 1 card to Stone Card (+50 chips, no rank/suit)\n- With Splash, all cards count, so this +50 chips would always contribute\n- Stone cards lose their rank/suit, which means they won't participate in forming specific hand types\n- However, with Splash, they still contribute their +50 chips\n\n\n- The tradeoff is that converting a card to Stone removes it from hand type formations—it can't be part of pairs, straights, or flushes anymore. This limits my flexibility when trying to trigger Zany Joker's Three of a Kind bonus. Meanwhile, the Mult Cards I just created give consistent +8 Mult per hand through Splash, which feels more synergistic with my current setup. I'm approaching the Big Blind soon, so I need to consider whether the chip boost from Stone is worth sacrificing hand composition flexibility. d +50 chips to that pair's score. Over multiple rounds, that's a massive cumulative advantage. The economic flexibility argument is weaker than I initially thought because +50 chips per hand is such a significant power spike.\n\nLet me think about the actual math: if I play 3-4 hands per round, that Stone card adds 150-200 chips across the round. Saving $3 to maybe afford something slightly better later doesn't guarantee I'll find a better card, and the opportunity cost of not having that chip boost now is real.\n\nI'm going to buy The Tower. The Stone card's consistent chip generation outweighs the minor loss of economic flexibility, especially since my hand-forming ability is already solid with my current setup. I'll have better opportunities to spend money in future shops, and my current deck with the Mult Cards and Green Joker scaling should handle the Big Blind adequately.","action":"\"round_select\""}
