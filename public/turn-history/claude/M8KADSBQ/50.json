{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $8\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +1 Mult per hand played, -1 per discard (currently +1)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Shop Items:**\n1. The Lovers (Tarot): Enhances 1 card into Wild Card - $3\n2. Venus (Planet): Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips - $3\n3. Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n4. Jumbo Spectral Pack: Choose 1 of 4 Spectral cards - $6\n5. Hieroglyph (Voucher): -1 Ante, -1 hand each round - $10\n\n**Current Reroll Cost: $5**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just beat the Boss Blind in Ante 2, which means I'm moving into Ante 3. The chip requirements will be significantly higher.\n\nMy current strategy heavily relies on:\n- Three of a Kind hands (Zany Joker gives +12 Mult)\n- Mystic Summit (+15 Mult when 0 discards)\n- Splash (every played card counts)\n- Merry Andy (extra discards to get to 0 discards)\n\nThe most valuable purchase here is **Venus** - the Planet card that levels up Three of a Kind. Currently, Three of a Kind is Level 1 with Base Chips 30 and Base Mult 3. \n\nVenus would upgrade it to Level 2 with Base Chips 50 and Base Mult 5. This is essential since I've been consistently scoring with Three of a Kind hands (just hit 2,480 chips), and upgrading my primary hand type is one of the strongest moves available. With Zany Joker multiplying these hands by 12, the scaling compounds significantly. I can grab Venus for $3 plus The Lovers for another $3, leaving me with $2 remaining.\n\nThe optimal play is purchasing Venus to strengthen Three of a Kind directly. After spending $3, I'll have $5 left to decide between The Lovers ($3 for a Wild Card), a Standard Pack ($4 for deck improvement), or banking the money for future shops. The Lovers creates a one-time utility, while the Standard Pack might offer better card options. I'm leaning toward Venus now and then reassessing whether to reroll with the remaining funds to find additional upgrades.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
