{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers (4/5): Merry Andy, Zany Joker, Splash, Mystic Summit\n- Consumables (1/2): The Magician\n- Voucher: Hieroglyph\n\n**Shop:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Pluto (Planet) - Level up High Card, Cost: $0 (FREE)\n  2. Misprint (Joker) - \"+.\" description, Cost: $0 (FREE)\n- Boosters:\n  1. Standard Pack - Cost: $0 (FREE)\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Director's Cut - Cost: $10 (too expensive)\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**What I just did:**\nI successfully applied Polychrome edition to the 8 of Clubs (which had +4 Mult enhancement). This gives it X1.5 Mult, which will multiply my final multiplier by 1.5 when it's played.\n\n**What's left in the shop:**\nAll the cards and boosters are still FREE. I should take advantage of this before moving to round select.\n\n1. **Pluto** - Levels up High Card. I don't play High Card (0 times played), so this is low priority.\n\n2. **Misprint** - This is a joker that gives random mult between +0 and +23. It's inconsistent but could be useful. I have room for 1 more joker.\n\n3. **Standard Pack** - Choose 1 of up to 3 playing cards to add to deck. This could help me get better cards.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nMy strategy revolves around:\n- Three of a Kind (Level 2, +12 Mult from Zany Joker)\n\n\n- Two Pair and Pair (both leveled up)\n- Splash making all cards count\n- Mystic Summit providing +15 Mult when I have no discards left\n- The Polychrome 8 of Clubs with +4 Mult enhancement multiplying my total\n\nSince both the Standard Pack and Misprint are free, I should grab both. The Standard Pack could improve my hand composition, while Misprint fills my last joker slot with a chance at bonus multiplier. Pluto remains unnecessary since I never form High Card hands.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
