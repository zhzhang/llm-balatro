{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 9\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $13\n- Just sold Misprint joker for $2 (was $11, now $13)\n\n**Current Jokers (4/5):**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Juggler - +1 hand size for $4\n2. Jupiter (Planet) - Level up Flush for $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - $4\n2. Standard Pack - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Director's Cut - Reroll Boss Blind for $10\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just sold Misprint to make room for Juggler. Now I have 4/5 joker slots and $13.\n\nThe plan was to buy Juggler for $4, which would:\n- Cost $4, leaving me with $9\n- Give me +1 hand size\n- Combined with Merry Andy's -1 hand size, I'd be back to normal hand size (7 cards)\n- But I'd still have the +3 discards from Merry Andy\n\nThis is a good synergy. With Splash making every card count, having 7 cards to play instead of 6 is valuable.\n\nLet me calculate the value:\n- Currently with Merry Andy alone: 6 card hand size, +3 discards\n- With Merry Andy + Juggler: 7 card hand size, +3 discards\n\nSince Splash makes every card count in scoring, that extra card could add roughly 10+ chips per hand, which when multiplied could be significant.\n\n\nJuggler is the move here—it directly counters Merry Andy's hand size penalty while keeping the discount boost. With $9 remaining after the purchase, I could explore Jupiter for Flush scaling or hold for future rounds, but the immediate synergy is too good to pass up.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
