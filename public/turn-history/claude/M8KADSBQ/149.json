{"reasoning":"The player tried to use The Devil consumable but got an error \"Cannot use consumable at position 1\". \n\nLooking at the failed action: `{'status': 'ready', 'positions': [1, 3], 'action': 'use_consumable'}`\n\nThe issue is that the player is currently in the SHOP phase, not in a phase where they have their hand visible. In the SHOP phase, you cannot see or access your hand cards to use consumables on them.\n\nThe use_consumable command requires:\n- The consumable position (1 - The Devil)\n- The target card position(s) from the hand\n\nBut since we're in the SHOP phase, the hand is not accessible. The player needs to either:\n1. Wait until they're in the ROUND phase where they can see and access their hand\n2. Or proceed to round_select now\n\nLooking at the context, the player wants to use The Devil to enhance a card into a Gold Card. However, this can only be done during the ROUND phase when the hand is visible.\n\nThe best action now is to proceed to round_select, which will move to the BLIND SELECT phase, and then to the ROUND phase where they can use The Devil consumable.\n\nLet me check the available options:\n- Money: $34\n- Shop has: Magic Trick voucher for $10\n- Reroll costs $5\n\nOptions:\n1. Buy Magic Trick for $10 (not immediately useful)\n2. Reroll for $5 (might get something better)\n3. Just proceed to round_select\n\nGiven that the player has The Devil consumable ready to use and wants to enhance a card, the best move is to proceed to round_select and use The Devil during the actual round when the hand is accessible.","action":"\"round_select\""}
