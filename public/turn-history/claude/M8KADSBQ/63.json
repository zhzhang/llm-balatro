{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Just beat the Small Blind (Round 7) with a Three of a Kind\n- Current Money: $11\n- Ante: 3/8\n- Currently in SHOP phase\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +1 Mult)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\nI have 5/5 joker slots filled.\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. The Magician (Tarot) - Enhances 2 selected cards to Lucky Cards - $3\n2. Lusty Joker - Played cards with Heart suit give +3 Mult when scored - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - $4\n2. Standard Pack - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Hieroglyph - -1 Ante, -1 hand each round - $10\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Hieroglyph voucher is interesting - it reduces the Ante by 1 (making progress easier) but also reduces hands per round by 1, which could be problematic. With $11, I can afford it with $1 left over. However, reducing hands might hurt my ability to win rounds, especially with Merry Andy already reducing my hand size.\n\nThe Magician could be useful to create Lucky Cards (1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20), but I'd need to identify good target cards in my deck.\n\nLusty Joker would give +3 Mult per Heart card scored. Looking at my hand composition, I don't have a particularly strong Heart focus, so this might not be the best fit.\n\n\nStandard Packs are pricey at $4 each but could help me find better cards. My joker lineup has some weak spots—Green Joker is barely contributing at +1 Mult, while Zany Joker, Splash, and Mystic Summit are doing heavy lifting. I should consider whether selling Green Joker makes sense if I find a stronger replacement.\n\nWith $11 available before the Big Blind and Boss rounds, I'm weighing three main options: investing $3 in The Magician to convert frequently-played cards into Lucky Cards (which offer a 1 in 5 shot at +20 Mult), rerolling the shop for better jokers or cards, or buying a Standard Pack. Since I've been relying on Pairs and Three of a Kind, enhancing cards that fit those patterns could compound my damage significantly.\n\nThe Hieroglyph voucher is also tempting at $10—it drops my Ante from 3 to 2, meaning lower chip requirements for the remaining blinds, which is a major advantage. The trade-off is losing one hand per round, though my Merry Andy joker's +3 discards should help mitigate that constraint.\n\nComparing my options—The Magician ($3), a reroll ($5), or a Standard Pack ($4)—the Hieroglyph's value of essentially skipping an entire Ante tier seems strongest strategically.","action":"\"buy_voucher\"\nPositions: [1]"}
