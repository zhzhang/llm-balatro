{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips +4 Mult, Enhanced: Mult)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- I have FOUR QUEENS! (Q♠, Q♥, Q♣, Q♦)\n- I have a Mult-enhanced King of Diamonds that gives +4 mult\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 2\n- Need: 3000 chips total\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have FOUR QUEENS, which is a Four of a Kind! This is excellent.\n\nLet me calculate the score for Four of a Kind with all my current joker effects:\n\n**Four of a Kind (Queens):**\n- Base: 60 chips, 7 mult (Level 1)\n- Zany Joker triggers: +12 mult → 19 mult\n- All 8 cards contribute via Splash:\n  - K♠: +10\n  - Q♠: +10\n  - Q♥: +10\n  - Q♣: +10\n  - J♣: +10\n  - K♦: +10 (base chips) +4 mult (enhancement)\n  - Q♦: +10\n  - 2♦: +2\n  - Total from cards: 72 chips\n- Total chips: 60 (base) + 72 (cards) = 132 chips\n- Total mult: 19 (base + Zany) + 4 (K♦ enhancement) = 23 mult\n- Score WITHOUT Mystic Summit: 132 × 23 = 3,036 chips\n\nThis already exceeds the 3000 chip requirement! I'm considering whether to use my remaining discards to trigger Mystic Summit's +15 mult bonus, which would push the score even higher, but I need to verify if that's necessary or if playing this hand immediately is the better move.\n\nWith Mystic Summit active, the multiplier would jump to 38 (19 + 4 + 15), yielding 5,016 chips. Since I'm already winning without it, I should just play the hand now rather than waste discards. Let me trace through the exact scoring sequence to confirm the enhancement timing is correct.\n\nDuring scoring, 'On scored' Jokers like Splash trigger after each card's base value, meaning all 8 cards in my hand will score rather than just the Four of a Kind. Recalculating with this in mind: the base hand gives 60 chips and 7 mult, then each card scores left-to-right starting with K♠, Q♠, and Q♥ each adding 10 chips.\n\nThe remaining cards continue this pattern—Q♣, J♣, K♦ (which also grants +4 mult from its enhancement), Q♦, and 2♦ each contribute their chip values. This totals 132 chips and 11 mult before Joker effects. Zany Joker then activates since the Four of a Kind contains a Three of a Kind, adding 12 mult for a final multiplier of 23. The resulting score of 132 × 23 = 3,036 chips exceeds the 3000 threshold, so I should play this hand now.\n\nI need to decide which cards to select. Since Splash means all cards in my hand contribute to scoring regardless of selection, I should focus on forming the strongest poker hand. With a maximum of 5 cards per play, I'll select the four Queens to establish the Four of a Kind, which triggers Zany Joker's bonus. 2. Q♥: +10 chips\n3. Q♣: +10 chips\n4. K♦: +10 chips, +4 mult\n5. Q♦: +10 chips\n\nThat gives me 110 total chips and 23 mult without Mystic Summit, scoring 2,530. But if I use my remaining discards to trigger Mystic Summit's +15 mult bonus, I'd reach 38 mult total and score 4,180 instead—a significant improvement that pushes me well over 3000. 110 chips × 23 mult = 2,530 chips without Mystic Summit. I should use my remaining 2 discards to activate Mystic Summit, which will boost me to 4,180 chips. Let me figure out which 2 cards to discard.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,8]"}
