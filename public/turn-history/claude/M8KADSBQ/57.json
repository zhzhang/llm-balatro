{"reasoning":"Let me carefully analyze this situation.\n\nCurrent hand:\n1. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n2. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n3. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult enhancement)\n4. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n5. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips, +4 Mult enhancement)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\nResources:\n- 4 hands remaining\n- 5 discards remaining\n- Need 2000 chips\n- Current chips: 0\n\nJokers:\n1. Green Joker: Currently +0 Mult (goes down by 1 per discard, up by 1 per play)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards each round, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\nI can see I have a pair of Kings (positions 1 and 6). Let me think about my options:\n\n1. Keep trying to find a third King for Three of a Kind (2 Kings left in 35 cards)\n2. Use Mystic Summit by exhausting discards and playing with 0 discards remaining\n3. Play what I have now\n\nLet me calculate what I can score with the current hand if I play all cards with the pair of Kings:\n\n**Playing pair of Kings with all 7 cards (using Splash):**\n- Base: 25 chips, 3 mult (Level 2 Pair)\n- Cards that count (all 7 with Splash):\n  - King of Hearts: +10\n  - King of Diamonds: +10 (also +4 mult from enhancement)\n  - 8 of Clubs: +8 (also +4 mult from enhancement)\n  - Queen of Diamonds: +10\n  - 7 of Clubs: +7\n  - 4 of Hearts: +4\n  - 2 of Clubs: +2\n\nTotal chips: 25 + 10 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 7 + 4 + 2 = 76 chips\n\nMultiplier:\n- Base: 3\n- King of Diamonds enhancement: +4\n- 8 of Clubs enhancement: +4\n- Green Joker: 0\n- Total: 11x\n\nFinal score: 76 × 11 = 836 chips. This falls short of the 2000 needed, so I need to explore other strategies or find ways to build a stronger hand.\n\nIf Mystic Summit activates with 0 discards left, the multiplier jumps to 21x (base 3 + 4 + 4 - 5 from Green Joker after 5 more discards + 15 from Mystic Summit), giving 76 × 21 = 1,596 chips—still insufficient. A Three of a Kind could help, offering 50 chips and 5x multiplier at Level 2, but I need to see what cards are available to complete that hand.\n\nPlaying three Kings with supporting cards like the 8 of Clubs and Queen of Diamonds would give 98 chips total. The multiplier would stack to 21x with Zany Joker's +12 boost and the King of Diamonds' +4, though Green Joker's penalty would reduce it by 4 after accounting for the play.\n\nThat gives me 2,058 chips—enough to pass. The challenge is finding that third King among the remaining 35 cards. With only a 5.7% chance per draw, I'd need to discard multiple cards to improve my odds. But I'm noticing something odd: the hand state hasn't changed from the previous turn, which suggests my last discard command didn't execute properly. The game is still in SELECTING_HAND mode with the identical cards showing.\n\nSince I have 5 discards and 4 hands left, I'm committing to the Three of a Kind approach—it's my best shot at reaching the target. I'll keep the two Kings and discard the rest to maximize the probability of drawing a third King.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,7]"}
