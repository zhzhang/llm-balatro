{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 10\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $0\n- About to face Boss Blind\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers (5/5): Merry Andy, Zany Joker, Splash, Mystic Summit, Juggler\n- Consumables (1/2): Pluto (High Card level up)\n- Vouchers: Hieroglyph (-1 Ante, -1 hand each round)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Madness: $7 (X0.5 Mult, destroys random joker) - Too expensive and bad\n- Sly Joker: $3 (+50 Chips for Pair) - Can't afford\n- Director's Cut: $10 - Can't afford\n- Reroll: $5 - Can't afford\n\n**Recent Actions:**\n- Used Earth to level up Full House to Level 2\n- Bought Standard Pack and selected 9 of Spades (Mult + Holo edition)\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. I have $0, so I cannot buy anything\n2. I just added a powerful 9 of Spades (Mult + Holo) to my deck\n3. I'm about to face the Boss Blind\n4. My recent scores: Four of a Kind (4,180), Full House (3,906 at Level 1, now Level 2)\n\n**Analysis:**\nSince I have no money, my only options are:\n1. Sell something to get money (Pluto for $1, or any joker)\n2. Proceed to round select\n\nGiven that:\n- I just upgraded Full House and added a powerful card to my deck\n- My joker setup is solid (Splash + Mystic Summit is a strong engine)\n- Pluto only levels up High Card, which I never use\n- The shop options aren't great (Madness is bad, Sly Joker is mediocre)\n\n\n- Even selling Pluto would only net $1, which doesn't unlock any meaningful purchases\n\nMoving forward to the Boss Blind with my current deck makes the most sense. The recent upgrades to Full House and the new Holo Mult card should provide enough scoring power, and there's no point liquidating assets for purchases I can't actually make.","action":"\"round_select\""}
