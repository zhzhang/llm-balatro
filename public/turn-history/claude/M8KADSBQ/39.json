{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n- Next challenge: Boss Blind requiring 1600 chips\n- Boss effect: \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +7 Mult (scales with hands/discards)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. One slot available\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 2 (25 chips, 3 mult) - Most played (4 times)\n- Straight: Level 2 (60 chips, 7 mult) - Just upgraded (2 times played)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - Played 3 times\n- Other hands mostly Level 1\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Neptune (Planet): Level up Straight Flush - Cost: $3 (not useful, haven't played it)\n2. Mystic Summit (Joker): +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining - Cost: $5\n3. Arcana Pack (Booster): Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards - Cost: $4\n4. Tarot Merchant (Voucher): Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently - Cost: $10 (too expensive)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need to prepare for the Boss Blind (1600 chips) with cards being drawn face down. This is a challenging mechanic.\n\nLooking at my recent scoring:\n- Last hand: 784 chips (Pair)\n- Before that: 621 chips (Pair)\n\n\n- Averaging 600-800 chips per hand with my current setup, so I'll need roughly 2-3 hands to hit the 1600 target.\n\nThe Mystic Summit option is compelling—pairing its +15 Mult with Green Joker's +7 Mult gives me +22 Mult when I exhaust my discards. Since Merry Andy provides 7 discards per round, I could use them all strategically and then play hands with that multiplier boost. But spending my entire budget leaves me vulnerable if I need adjustments.\n\nAlternatively, the Arcana Pack costs $4 and leaves me with $1. Tarot cards can permanently upgrade my deck—converting cards to Mult or Bonus variants, or applying other modifications that strengthen my overall hand strength. I could also skip purchases entirely and save my $5 for the boss round, or spend it on a reroll hoping for better shop options. The face-down cards make it harder to construct specific hands, though my Splash Joker helps since every card I play contributes to my score.\n\nMystic Summit is tempting because of its +15 Mult multiplier, but executing it requires careful discard management—I'd need to use all 7 discards from Merry Andy to cycle through cards before playing my final hands. The problem is that with cards face-down, I can't see what I'm discarding, making this strategy risky. The Arcana Pack offers a safer path by giving me permanent deck improvements like card enhancements or duplicates that would carry forward regardless of the current hand visibility issue. I have $5 to spend and need to decide between Mystic Summit ($5), an Arcana Pack ($4), a reroll ($5), or saving for the boss. Mystic Summit stands out as the strongest choice—with 7 discards and the ability to stack +22 Mult (Green Joker at +7 plus Mystic Summit at +15), I can generate massive scoring potential by cycling through cards strategically and unleashing high-value hands when discards run out. This multiplicative approach gives me the best shot at hitting 1600 chips.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
