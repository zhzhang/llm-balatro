{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in the TAROT_PACK phase where I need to choose one of three tarot cards:\n\n1. **The Wheel of Fortune** - 1 in 4 chance to add Foil, Holographic, or Polychrome edition to a random Joker\n   - Foil: +50 chips\n   - Holographic: +10 Mult\n   - Polychrome: X1.5 Mult\n\n2. **The Star** - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Diamonds\n\n3. **The Sun** - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Hearts\n\nCurrent hand:\n1. 8 of Spades\n2. 7 of Hearts\n3. 3 of Hearts\n4. Queen of Clubs\n5. 8 of Clubs (Mult Enhancement, Holo edition) - +8 chips, +4 Mult from enhancement, +10 Mult from holo edition\n6. Queen of Diamonds\n7. Jack of Diamonds\n8. 10 of Diamonds\n\nLet me analyze what makes sense:\n\n**The Wheel of Fortune**: This is a gamble with 1 in 4 chance (25% chance) to add an edition to one of my jokers. The editions are powerful but it's random which joker gets it and random which edition. Given that I have 5 jokers, this could be valuable but it's risky.\n\n**The Star/Sun (suit conversion)**: These convert cards to a specific suit. Looking at my hand:\n- Diamonds: Queen, Jack, 10 (3 cards)\n- Hearts: 7, 3 (2 cards)\n- Clubs: Queen, 8 (2 cards - note the 8 of Clubs is enhanced)\n- Spades: 8 (1 card)\n\nConverting to Diamonds or Hearts could help me make flushes or flush-based hands. However, my strategy isn't really focused on flushes - I focus on pairs, three of a kind, full houses, etc. I've only played Flush once according to the stats.\n\n\nWith Splash active, every card in a flush contributes to scoring, making it significantly more valuable than my usual approach. Converting three cards to Diamonds gives me a strong foundation—I already have Queen, Jack, and 10 of Diamonds, so adding the two Queens and an 8 would create a pair of Queens plus additional Diamond chips. This is more reliable than gambling on The Wheel of Fortune's 25% success rate. 8♠ → 8♦ and 7♥ → 7♦, giving me six diamonds total: Q♦, J♦, 10♦, Q♦, 8♦, 7♦. I could play a five-card flush using the pair of Queens, which would score all five cards' chips plus the pair multiplier. But I'm realizing the hand classification matters here—if I play five diamonds including the pair, does it count as a flush or does the pair take precedence?\n\nActually, the flush is the highest hand type, so it takes precedence over the pair. With Splash active, every card in the flush contributes its chip value. A level 1 flush gives 35 chips and 4x multiplier, so playing Q♦, Q♦, J♦, 10♦, 8♦ would be: 35 base + 48 from cards = 83 chips × 4 = 332 chips total. That's underwhelming compared to my Three of a Kind hands scoring 1800-2400 chips. I should focus on what **The Wheel of Fortune** could do if it triggers and grants an edition to one of my jokers.\n\nThe three possible editions would give different benefits: Foil adds 50 chips, Holographic adds 10 mult, or Polychrome multiplies mult by 1.5. Polychrome is strongest but only has a 25% chance, and it matters which joker receives it—scoring jokers like Zany or Mystic Summit would benefit more than utility pieces like Merry Andy or Splash. My current joker lineup includes Merry Andy for utility, Zany Joker for conditional mult, and Splash for card value expansion.\n\nLooking at the odds, only 2 of my 5 jokers would meaningfully gain from an edition effect, making the probability of a worthwhile outcome quite low. The Star or The Sun seem like more consistent choices. I should evaluate which suit conversion would be most valuable given my current hand composition—I'm holding an enhanced 8 of Clubs with strong mult potential, three Diamonds already, and two Hearts.\n\nConverting the 8 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, and 3 of Hearts to Diamonds would give me six total Diamonds, creating real flexibility for flush plays. Alternatively, I could use The Sun to convert cards to Hearts instead.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2,1,2,3]"}
