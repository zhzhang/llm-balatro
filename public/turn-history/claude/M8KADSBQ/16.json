{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2 (just won Big Blind, now in SHOP)\n- Money: $7\n- Green Joker: Currently +2 Mult\n- Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains Three of a Kind. Cost: $4\n2. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring. Cost: $3\n3. Jumbo Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of 4 Jokers. Cost: $6\n4. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards. Cost: $4\n5. Telescope voucher - Celestial Packs always contain Planet card for most played poker hand. Cost: $10 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just beat the Big Blind by playing a Three of a Kind. Looking at my hand history:\n- Three of a Kind - 300 chips\n- Two Pair - 162 chips\n- Straight - 296 chips\n- Flush - 280 chips\n\nI have $7 to spend. Let me consider the options:\n\n1. **Zany Joker ($4)** - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind hands. This is excellent synergy since I just played Three of a Kind and it's a hand type I can target. With my current Green Joker at +2 Mult, adding Zany Joker would give me +14 Mult total when playing Three of a Kind. This would be very strong.\n\n2. **Splash ($3)** - Every played card counts in scoring. This is interesting because normally only cards that participate in the hand type score. With Splash, if I play 5 cards, all 5 would add their chip values even if only 3 form a Three of a Kind. \n\nThis could substantially increase my scoring potential. The Zany Joker seems like the stronger pick though—it directly amplifies the hand I've been relying on. The Jumbo Buffoon Pack is tempting but costs $6 and leaves me with minimal funds, whereas I could grab Zany Joker and still have $3 left for Splash if needed. Tarot cards feel less impactful at this stage compared to joker synergies.\n\nLet me work through the numbers. Playing Three of a Kind with Zany Joker—if I hit three 10s for 30 chips, plus the base 30, I'm at 60 chips. My multiplier stacks to 17 (3 base + 2 from Green Joker + 12 from Zany), giving me 1,020 total. With Splash instead, I'd count all five cards in the hand rather than just three, so three 10s plus two face cards would give me 80 chips times 5 multiplier for 400 chips—significantly less powerful.\n\nSplash has broader applications across different hand types like Pairs or High Card, but Zany Joker's multiplicative scaling makes it the stronger choice right now since I can reliably construct Three of a Kind and need aggressive scoring growth in early antes. I'm also eyeing the Jumbo Buffoon Pack at $6, which would leave me with just $1 remaining. Buying both Zany Joker and Splash together for the full $7 creates a powerful combination—Splash makes all my played cards count while Zany adds +12 Mult to Three of a Kind hands, so a five-card Three of a Kind would score all five cards plus the multiplier boost. The math checks out: three Jacks (30 chips) plus two 10-value cards (20 chips) gives 80 total chips, then multiplied by my base mult of 3 plus Green Joker's 2 plus Zany's 12.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
