{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $1\n- Just used The Wheel of Fortune from the Jumbo Arcana Pack\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n\n**Shop:**\n- Gluttonous Joker: Played cards with Club suit give +3 Mult when scored. Cost: $5 (can't afford)\n- The Sun (Tarot): Converts up to 3 selected cards to Hearts. Cost: $3 (can't afford)\n- Jumbo Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards. Cost: $6 (can't afford)\n- Clearance Sale Voucher: All cards and packs 25% off. Cost: $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll cost: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $1, which means I cannot afford anything in the current shop. The cheapest item is The Sun at $3, and I only have $1.\n\nMy options are:\n1. Sell something to get more money\n2. Use Pluto to level up High Card\n3. Just proceed to the next round\n\nLet me think about what I could sell:\n- Pluto sells for $1 → would have $2 total (still not enough for anything)\n- Jokers sell for $1-$3 each\n\nIf I sell Pluto ($1) + Juggler ($2), I'd have $4 total - still not enough for anything useful.\n\n\nIf I sell Pluto ($1) + Merry Andy ($3), I'd have $5 total - could buy Gluttonous Joker or reroll. But Merry Andy's extra discards are valuable for my strategy. Alternatively, selling Pluto ($1) + Splash ($1) would give me $3 for The Sun, though Splash is essential since it makes every card count in scoring.\n\nFor Ante 4, I'm facing a significant scaling problem - I need 5,000+ chips minimum and likely much more for boss blinds, but my last attempt only scored 4,662. Gluttonous Joker could work if I stack multiple clubs with Splash active, and The Sun might unlock flush strategies by converting cards to Hearts. Actually, the better move is probably just using Pluto to level up High Card from Level 1, then moving forward into the round.\n\nLeveling High Card would boost it to Base Chips 15 and Base Mult 2 - not transformative, but useful as a fallback option. With only $1 available and Ante 4 looming, I need to be strategic. I could either use Pluto on High Card at no cost, or sell multiple items - Pluto, Zany Joker, and Juggler would give me $6 to buy a Jumbo Standard Pack for better card options. But sacrificing Juggler means losing hand size and losing Zany removes a key multiplier source.\n\nThe safest approach is to use Pluto now to level High Card, then proceed to the next round. This preserves my core jokers - Merry Andy for discards, Splash and Mystic Summit for damage - while giving me a stronger fallback if needed.","action":"\"round_select\""}
