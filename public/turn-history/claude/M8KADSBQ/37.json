{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $9\n- Just beat the Big Blind (needed 1200 chips, earned 1405 total from 2 hands)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: +7 Mult (scales with hands played)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. One slot available\n\n**Next Challenge:**\n- Boss Blind: needs 1600 chips\n- Boss Description: Cards drawn face down after each hand played\n- This is very challenging as I won't see my cards\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Neptune (Planet): Level up Straight Flush +4 Mult and +40 chips - Cost: $3\n2. Mystic Summit (Joker): +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining - Cost: $5\n3. Celestial Pack (Booster): Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards - Cost: $4\n4. Arcana Pack (Booster): Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards - Cost: $4\n5. Tarot Merchant (Voucher): Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently - Cost: $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nMy current strategy has been relying heavily on Pairs and Two Pairs with the Splash joker. I've been playing 4-5 cards per hand and scoring well (621 and 784 chips on the last two hands).\n\nFor the Boss Blind with face-down cards, I need to be able to score well regardless of what I see. This means I should:\n1. Maximize my joker effects that don't depend on specific hand types\n\n\n2. Focus on leveling up the hand types I play most frequently (Pair is already Level 2)\n3. Build more multiplicative power overall\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\nNeptune isn't useful since I haven't played Straight Flush yet. Mystic Summit offers strong multiplier potential at +15 Mult, but requires using all my discards—with Merry Andy giving me 7 total, that's a tight constraint. The real question is whether I can reliably empty my discard pool while still playing effective hands against the Boss Blind.\n\nCelestial Pack directly strengthens my core strategy by leveling Pair or Two Pair, which account for most of my plays. Arcana Pack could add multiplicative enhancements through Tarot effects. Reroll is an option if I want to search for something better.\n\n**Best Strategy:**\n\nSince Pairs and Two Pairs make up the majority of my scoring, and the Boss Blind's face-down mechanic demands consistency, I should prioritize upgrades that directly boost these hands. With $9 available, I can either invest in hand leveling or multiplicative effects—the key is ensuring I maintain reliable scoring when cards are obscured. With Mystic Summit, I'd gain +15 Mult when discards are depleted, stacking with Green Joker for +22 Mult total—but that requires committing all my discards. The Celestial Pack offers a more reliable path: leveling Pair to Level 3 would permanently boost its output from around 25 chips/3 mult to 30 chips/4 mult. Since I'm playing mostly Pairs with these face-down cards and need to preserve flexibility with my limited discards, the permanent hand improvement feels more practical than a conditional mult spike. I'll go with the Celestial Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
