{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small (800 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 378 (need 422 more)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 6\n- Current Money: $3\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n3. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n4. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n7. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Green Joker: Currently +3 Mult (increases per hand played, decreases per discard)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- I have TWO PAIRS: pair of 8s (8 of Spades, 8 of Diamonds) and pair of 7s (7 of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds)\n- Ranks: 10, 8, Ace, King, 7, 8, 7\n- Suits: Spades, Spades, Hearts, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Diamonds\n\n**Best hand available:** Two Pair (8s and 7s)\n\n**Scoring calculation for Two Pair:**\n- Two Pair is Level 1: 20 base chips, 2 base mult\n- Green Joker: +3 mult\n- Splash: All played cards count\n\n\n- Total mult: 5\n\nPlaying the two pair (8, 8, 7, 7) with the Ace gives me 20 base chips plus 41 from the five cards (8+8+7+7+11), totaling 61 chips. Multiplied by 5, that's 305 chips, bringing me to 683 total—still short of the 800 blind.\n\nI could instead discard and hunt for three of a kind to unlock Zany Joker's +12 mult. With 6 discards and 3 hands left, I have room to experiment. Looking at what's left in the deck: one 7, two 8s, two 10s, three Kings, and three Aces. If I land a third 8 or 7, I'd get 30 base chips plus roughly 45 from the cards (8+8+8+11+10), giving me 75 chips before the multiplier boost.\n\nWith Green Joker's +3 and Zany Joker's +12, that's 18x multiplier total—75 × 18 = 1,350 chips, which crushes the requirement in a single hand. But the probability is slim with only 3 matching cards out of 35 remaining. The safer play is sticking with two pair now for 683 total, then grinding out the remaining 117 chips across my last two hands with simple pairs. That path feels more reliable, though I'm weighing whether the three of a kind gamble is worth the risk. plus Ace:\n- Base chips for Two Pair (Level 1): 20\n- Card chips: 8 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 11 = 41\n- Total chips: 20 + 41 = 61\n- Base mult for Two Pair: 2\n- Green Joker mult: +3\n- Total mult: 2 + 3 = 5\n- Final score: 61 × 5 = 305 chips\n\nThis gets me to 683 total, leaving 117 chips to score in my final two hands. The math checks out—I'm going with this play.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,6,5,7,3]"}
