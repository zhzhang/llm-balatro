{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round 1\n- In SHOP phase after beating Small Blind\n- Money: $5\n- Owned Jokers: Green Joker (+0 Mult currently, scales with hands played)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (4 slots remaining)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (2 slots remaining)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Greedy Joker - $5 (gives +3 Mult for Diamond cards when scored)\n2. Buffoon Pack - $4 (choose 1 of 2 jokers)\n3. Mega Spectral Pack - $8 (can't afford)\n4. Telescope Voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n5. Reroll - $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith exactly $5, my options are:\n1. Buy Greedy Joker for $5 - leaves me with $0\n2. Buy Buffoon Pack for $4 - leaves me with $1\n3. Reroll shop for $5 - leaves me with $0\n4. Proceed to next round (round_select)\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n**Greedy Joker ($5):**\n- Gives +3 Mult per Diamond card that scores\n- Requires building around Diamonds\n- Situational - only works if I draw and play Diamonds\n- Not as consistent as Green Joker's scaling\n- Would leave me with $0\n\n**Buffoon Pack ($4):**\n- Gives me a choice of 2 random jokers\n- Could potentially get something better than Greedy Joker\n- Costs $4, leaves me with $1\n- More flexible option\n\n**Reroll ($5):**\n- Costs all my money\n- Could get better options\n- Risky - might not improve the shop\n\n**Proceed to Next Round:**\n\n\nSkipping purchases lets me bank the $5 and earn interest ($1 per $5), giving me more resources for upcoming rounds. Since I'm still early in the run facing increasingly difficult blinds, preserving capital while my Green Joker grows seems prudent. I've only played Flush and Straight once each so far, so I don't have a clear hand pattern to optimize around yet.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack is tempting—it costs $4, leaves me with $1, and offers two random jokers instead of relying on shop inventory. But I'm better off waiting. The Big Blind will generate income, and with more chips next round, I'll have better purchasing power and more information about what hand types I can reliably build.\n\n'll have 2 jokers for the Big Blind, which significantly improves my odds. The early joker economy matters more than preserving cash at this stage—having multiple jokers compounds my scaling potential across future rounds. I'll buy the Buffoon Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
