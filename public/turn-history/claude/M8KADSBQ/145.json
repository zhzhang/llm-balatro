{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $43 (just sold Pluto for $1)\n- Max Jokers: 6 (have 6)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (have 0)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card ($3 if held in hand at end of round), Cost: $3\n2. Jumbo Spectral Pack - Choose 1 of up to 4 Spectral cards, Cost: $6\n3. Magic Trick voucher - Playing cards can be purchased from shop, Cost: $10\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n6. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult), Negative edition\n\n**Hand Performance:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3, my best hand, scoring 2,912-4,324 chips recently\n- Straight: Level 2, scoring 2,997-4,662 chips\n- I'm at Ante 5/8, need to continue scaling\n\n**Options:**\n1. Buy The Devil for $3 - Would give me a Gold Card that generates $3 per round\n2. Buy Jumbo Spectral Pack for $6 - Risky but could get powerful effects\n3. Buy Magic Trick for $10 - Allows buying playing cards from shop\n4. Reroll shop for $5\n5. Just proceed to round_select\n\n\n6. The Devil seems worth it at $3 - a Gold Card generates recurring income while also providing +3 Mult when scored. Over the remaining antes, that's solid value. The Spectral Pack is tempting but unpredictable; it could yield something game-changing like Soul or Black Hole, but the risk might not be worth it right now.\n\nMagic Trick at $10 feels unnecessary since I'm not prioritizing card purchases from the shop. With $43 available, I could afford both The Devil and the Spectral Pack, but I need to weigh whether the steady scaling from The Devil matters more than gambling on a potential power spike from the pack.\n\nThe Devil's reliable $3 per round income compounds over the remaining antes, while the Spectral Pack could transform my deck with something like Black Hole—upgrading all poker hands—or Soul for a legendary joker. The risk is getting something less impactful. Given I'm at Ante 5/8 and need consistent scaling, I'll prioritize The Devil's guaranteed value first.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
