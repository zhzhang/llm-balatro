{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 2,997\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $36\n\n**Chips needed to win:** 10,000 - 2,997 = 7,003 more chips with 2 hands remaining\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n2. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 for $20)\n3. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult from enhancement, +10 Mult from holo edition = +14 Mult total)\n5. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips) - WAIT, there are TWO 8 of Diamonds!\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\nThis is EXCELLENT! I have THREE 8s: 8♣, 8♦, 8♦. This is a Three of a Kind!\n\nLet me calculate the chips for playing Three of a Kind with the three 8s:\n\n**Three of a Kind scoring:**\n- Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n\n\n- Base mult: 5 (Level 2)\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult (activates for Three of a Kind)\n- 8 of Clubs: +14 Mult (from +4 Mult enhancement and +10 holo)\n- Splash: All 5 played cards count\n\nI'll play the three 8s along with Ace of Clubs and King of Clubs to maximize chip generation. With Splash active, all five cards contribute their chip values: 8 + 8 + 8 + 11 + 10 = 45 chips added to the base 50.\n\nThis gives me 95 total chips and a multiplier of 31 (5 base + 12 from Zany Joker + 14 from the 8 of Clubs), resulting in 2,945 points. However, I realize I can do better by using my remaining discards first to trigger Mystic Summit's +15 Mult bonus, which would push the multiplier to 46 and the score to 4,370 chips—much closer to my target of 3,500 per hand.\n\nThe key insight is that once I exhaust all 4 discards now, Mystic Summit will remain active for both this hand and my final hand. After scoring 4,370 here, I'll have 7,367 total, leaving me needing just 2,633 from the last hand—easily achievable with the bonus still active.\n\nFor my discards, I should cycle through strategically to improve my options. The Ace of Clubs is a Lucky Card with potential multiplier value, so I'll keep that along with my three 8s. I'll discard the lower cards like the 2 of Hearts, Queen, and 10 to draw fresh cards that might give me better final hand possibilities.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,6]"}
