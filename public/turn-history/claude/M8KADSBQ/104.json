{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n3. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n5. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- I have THREE QUEENS! (Q♠, Q♥, Q♦)\n- I have a pair of 8s (both diamonds)\n- I have 5 diamonds (Q♦, J♦, 8♦, 8♦, 2♦) - a flush!\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 4\n- Need: 3000 chips\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n1. Three of a Kind (Queens) - This triggers Zany Joker for +12 mult!\n2. Flush (5 diamonds)\n3. Full House (3 Queens + 2 8s)\n\nLet me calculate the scores for each option:\n\n**Option 1: Three of a Kind (Queens)**\n- Base: 50 chips, 5 mult (Level 2)\n- Zany Joker: +12 mult → 17 mult\n- Cards in hand contribute via Splash: All 8 cards score\n\n\n- Q♠: +10, Q♥: +10, Q♦: +10, 9♠: +9, J♦: +10, 8♦: +8, 8♦: +8, 2♦: +2\n- Total from cards: 67 chips\n- Score: (50 + 67) × 17 = 1,989 chips\n\nIf I exhaust all 4 discards to activate Mystic Summit, the multiplier jumps to 32, pushing the final score significantly higher.\n\nFor a flush with five diamonds, the base hand only provides 6 multiplier. Even with Mystic Summit's boost to 21 multiplier, the score reaches just 2,457 chips—still short of the 3,000 threshold. The three-of-a-kind requirement means Zany Joker won't contribute here either.\n\nA full house with three Queens and two 8s initially seems weak at 4 multiplier, but I need to reconsider whether it qualifies for Zany Joker's bonus. Since a full house contains three of a kind within it—you can form three Queens from the hand—the bonus should apply, bringing the multiplier to 16 before accounting for additional cards and effects.\n\nAll eight cards contribute 67 chips to the score, making the total 107 chips × 16 multiplier = 1,712 chips. If I activate Mystic Summit by using my remaining discards, the multiplier jumps to 31, yielding 3,317 chips—still exceeding the 3,000 threshold. However, the three of a kind with just the Queens performs better at 3,744 chips with Mystic Summit active. My best move is to discard the four non-Queen cards to trigger Mystic Summit, then play the three Queens.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,5,6,7]"}
