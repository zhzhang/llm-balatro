{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state carefully:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 12\n- Boss Blind: Must play 5 cards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 2,997\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 5\n- Money: $36\n\n**Chips needed to win:** 10,000 - 2,997 = 7,003 more chips\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n2. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips, Lucky Card - 1 in 5 for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 for $20)\n3. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips, +4 Mult from enhancement, +10 Mult from holo edition = +14 Mult total)\n5. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n7. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n8. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Key observations:**\n- I have a pair of 8s (8 of Clubs with special bonuses, 8 of Diamonds)\n- I have 4 Diamonds (Queen, 8, 6, 5) - need 5 for a Flush\n- The 8 of Clubs has +14 Mult when scored\n- If I use all 5 remaining discards, Mystic Summit will activate on the final hand (+15 Mult)\n\n\n- I'm comparing a pair of 8s against a potential flush. The pair scores base 25 chips with 3 Mult, but with Splash all 5 cards contribute their chip values. The 8 of Clubs adds significant Mult. A flush would give 50 base chips and 6 Mult, but requires discarding and hoping to draw another diamond.\n\nLet me work through the pair scenario. Playing 8♣, 8♦, Ace♣, Queen♦, King♣ gives me 47 chips from the cards themselves, plus the 25 base chips for 72 total. The 8 of Clubs multiplier of +14 combined with the base 3 Mult gets me to 17 Mult, resulting in 1,224 chips. That falls short of what I need by 7,003 chips across my remaining hands.\n\nI should check what happens if I use Mystic Summit to reset my discards, since that could open up better options for my final hand. the flush, no bonus (the 8♣ has the enhancement, not 8♦)\n- With Mystic Summit: mult = 6 + 15 = 21\n- Total: ~100 × 21 = ~2,100 chips\n\nAlso not great.\n\nI need to reconsider the overall approach. With 2 hands and 5 discards left, I could either spend them now to improve this hand, or save them all for the final hand when Mystic Summit triggers. The key decision is whether to chase better cards immediately or preserve discards for maximum multiplier on the last hand.\n\nSince I need roughly 3,500 chips per hand to reach 7,003 total, the Mystic Summit bonus becomes essential. I could try building toward a Three of a Kind with the remaining 8s in the deck, complete a Diamond flush, or work toward a Straight. Three of a Kind would activate the Zany Joker's +12 multiplier, though with only 2 eights left, the odds are tight.\n\nI'm going to discard strategically—removing cards that don't contribute to these patterns while keeping my clubs and diamonds. The key insight is that I have 5 discards total, so I should use 4 now to strengthen this hand and save the final discard for when Mystic Summit activates on my last hand.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider the timing. Mystic Summit triggers when I have zero discards remaining at play time. If I exhaust all 5 discards now, this hand plays with the multiplier active, and then my final hand will also have it active since no discards remain. So I should go ahead and use all my discards aggressively on this hand to maximize its potential, then benefit from the multiplier again on the last hand.\n\nThe 9 of Hearts is clearly dead weight and should go. But I'm torn on the diamonds—keeping them opens a Flush possibility if I draw a fifth one. Still, I need to be bolder here. I'll discard the 9♥, 5♦, and 6♦ to give myself real chances at improvement while accepting the risk of losing the Flush draw.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,7,8]"}
