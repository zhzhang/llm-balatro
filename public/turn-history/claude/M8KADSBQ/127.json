{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $1\n- Need to decide whether to play or skip the Small Blind\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. Small Blind: 5,000 chips needed, $3 reward, skip tag = Negative Tag (free Negative joker in shop)\n2. Big Blind: 7,500 chips needed, $4 reward, skip tag = Skip Tag ($10 reward)\n3. Boss Blind: 10,000 chips needed, $5 reward, must play 5 cards\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card\n\n**Key Concerns:**\n\nLooking at my last played hands:\n- Straight: 4,662 chips (Ante 3 Boss)\n- Four of a Kind: 4,180 chips (Ante 3 Big)\n- Full House: 3,906 chips (Ante 3 Small)\n\nThe Small Blind needs 5,000 chips - I was scoring 3,906 on Ante 3's Small Blind and 4,662 on the Boss. This is concerning because:\n1. I need 5,000 chips for the Small Blind in Ante 4\n2. My last boss attempt only got 4,662 chips\n3. I'm not likely to beat this without significant luck or hand draws\n\nHowever, the Negative Tag is extremely valuable. A Negative joker has an edition that gives +1 joker slot, which would allow me to have 6 jokers instead of 5. \n\nThe math doesn't look promising. Even with Splash making all cards count and Mystic Summit's +15 mult at 0 discards, a Straight would only generate around 2,200 chips—far short of the 5,000 needed. A Full House wouldn't fare much better, likely capping out well below the threshold.\n\nI'm fundamentally underpowered for this ante. Skipping would grant me a Negative Tag (making the next base edition Joker free and adding a slot), but I'd forfeit the $3 reward and jump straight to the Big Blind at 7,500 chips without a shop in between.\n\nPlaying offers a chance at the $3 and access to the shop if I win, but I'm unlikely to score the 5,000 chips needed given my current setup. The real question is whether the Negative Tag's permanent +1 joker slot is worth the risk of facing an even harder Big Blind unprepared.\n\nIf I skip both Small and Big Blinds, I'll accumulate the Negative Tag and Skip Tag before hitting the Boss—a 10,000 chip wall that forces 5 cards. The mandatory 5-card requirement actually synergizes with my Splash joker, making it less punishing than it seems. Skipping now to secure that extra joker slot long-term seems like the stronger play than gambling on a blind I'm likely to lose.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
