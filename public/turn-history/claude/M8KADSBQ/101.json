{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 10\n- Big Blind: Need 3000 chips\n- Current chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 7\n- Money: $2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n3. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n5. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n6. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Active Jokers:**\n1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLet me identify possible hands in my current cards:\n\nPossible plays:\n- Pair of Queens (Q♠, Q♦)\n- Hearts flush (J♥, 9♥, 6♥, 5♥) - 4 cards, not quite a flush (needs 5)\n- No three of a kind, no straight visible\n\nLooking at suits:\n- Spades: 2 cards (Q, 4)\n- Hearts: 4 cards (J, 9, 6, 5)\n- Diamonds: 2 cards (Q, 8)\n\nI need to think about my strategy here. I have:\n- Splash joker which makes every played card count\n- A pair of Queens available\n- 4 Hearts that are close to a flush\n\n\n- With Splash active, every card I play will contribute to the score\n\nLet me evaluate playing the pair of Queens: that gives me 25 base chips with 3x multiplier, plus the 20 chips from both Queens themselves. The Zany Joker won't trigger since I need three of a kind, and Mystic Summit won't help unless I use all my discards first.\n\nThat only reaches 135 chips—nowhere near the 3000 I need. I should discard strategically instead. I have 7 discards left across 3 hands, so I can afford to search for stronger combinations like three of a kind for the Zany Joker's +12 mult, or complete the flush since I already have 4 hearts. The 4♠ and 8♦ aren't contributing to any pattern, so those are prime candidates to get rid of. Three of a kind would be particularly valuable since it triggers the Joker bonus.\n\nActually, looking at the deck composition—15 diamonds, 7 hearts, 13 clubs, 10 spades—diamonds are far more abundant than hearts. I should pivot toward building a diamond flush instead of chasing hearts, which means keeping the 8♦ and discarding cards that don't support that goal.\n\nBut I'm torn because I already have 4 hearts in hand, putting me just one card away from a flush there. The tradeoff is that discarding both queens eliminates my pair, which is a guaranteed hand. I need to weigh whether the probability of hitting another heart justifies losing the pair security.\n\nLooking at the scoring potential: a level 2 flush gives 50 base chips with 6 multiplier. If I complete the hearts flush with my J, 9, 6, and 5 plus one more heart, that's at least 80 chips before multipliers. With Splash making all cards score and my other jokers providing additional multipliers, this could get me closer to the 3000 chips I need. The Mystic Summit also rewards me for using all my discards, which aligns with this aggressive draw strategy. Jacks: 1 (J♥)\n- 9s: 1 (9♥)\n- 6s: 1 (6♥)\n- 5s: 1 (5♥)\n- 4s: 1 (4♠)\n- 8s: 1 (8♦)\n\nThe pair of queens is my best shot at three of a kind. I'll discard the singleton cards to make room for another queen. Since I can only discard 5 cards per hand, I'll start by removing the J♥, 9♥, 6♥, 5♥, and 4♠, keeping both queens and the 8♦ for now.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
