{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 9\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $2\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (FULL)\n- Consumables: 2/2 (FULL) - Pluto (level up High Card) and Jupiter (level up Flush)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Standard Pack - $4 (I only have $2, can't afford)\n- Director's Cut voucher - $10 (I only have $2, can't afford)\n- Reroll - $5 (I only have $2, can't afford)\n\n**Recent Actions:**\n- I converted 3 cards to Diamonds using The Star tarot\n- I bought Jupiter (planet card to level up Flush)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI have $2 left and cannot afford anything in the shop. My options are:\n1. Use my consumables (Pluto or Jupiter)\n2. Sell something to make room or get money\n3. Proceed to the next round\n\nSince I converted cards to Diamonds and bought Jupiter specifically to level up Flush, I should use Jupiter to level up Flush from Level 1 (35 chips, 4 mult) to Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult). This would synergize with my diamond conversion strategy.\n\nI could also use Pluto to level up High Card, but that doesn't align with my current strategy.\n\nGiven that:\n- I've set up a flush strategy by converting cards to Diamonds\n- I bought Jupiter specifically to level up Flush\n- I can't afford anything else in the shop\n- I should probably use Jupiter now and then proceed to the next round\n\nThe best action is to use Jupiter to level up Flush, then proceed to the blind select.\n\nCommand: use_consumable 2\n\nWait, Jupiter doesn't require targets, so I just need the consumable position.","action":"\"use_consumable\"\nPositions: [2]"}
