{"reasoning":"I'm in the SHOP phase after beating the Big Blind with a Four of a Kind hand that scored 4,180 chips. I have $8 available.\n\nLet me analyze my current situation:\n\n**Inventory:**\n- 5/5 Jokers (at max capacity):\n  1. Merry Andy - +3 discards, -1 hand size\n  2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult for Three of a Kind\n  3. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n  4. Mystic Summit - +15 Mult at 0 discards\n  5. Juggler - +1 hand size\n- 1/2 Consumables:\n  1. Pluto - Level up High Card\n\n**Shop:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Madness - X0.5 Mult when selecting blinds, destroys a random joker (Currently X1 Mult) - $7\n  2. Sly Joker - +50 Chips for Pair - $3\n- Boosters:\n  1. Standard Pack - $4\n  2. Arcana Pack - $4\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Director's Cut - Reroll boss 1 time per Ante - $10\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm about to face the Boss Blind of Ante 3. Looking at my jokers:\n- Splash is incredibly powerful as it makes every card in hand score\n- Mystic Summit gives +15 mult when I have 0 discards\n- Zany Joker gives +12 mult for Three of a Kind\n- Merry Andy gives me +3 discards per round\n- Juggler gives +1 hand size\n\nThe shop options:\n1. Madness - This is risky because it destroys a random joker. Currently at X1 mult, and it goes to X0.5 mult when I select blinds. This seems bad - destroying a joker is a huge downside.\n\n\n2. Sly Joker - Adds +50 chips per pair, which could complement my existing setup since pairs appear frequently, though Splash already provides solid baseline scoring.\n3. Standard Pack and Arcana Pack - Both offer card enhancements or tarot effects that could strengthen my deck or jokers.\n4. Director's Cut - Too expensive at $10 when I only have $8 available.\n\nSince I'm heading into the Boss Blind, I need to focus on what maximizes my scoring potential. My core strategy relies on Splash and Mystic Summit working together, so I should consider whether adding another joker or getting card enhancements would be more valuable than my current setup.\n\nIf I were to purchase Sly Joker for $3, I'd need to sacrifice one of my existing jokers. Merry Andy's extra discards fuel my Mystic Summit strategy, while Zany Joker provides situational mult boosts. Splash is non-negotiable since it's fundamental to my approach, and Mystic Summit's +15 mult at zero discards is too powerful to lose. Juggler offers minimal value compared to the others.\n\nSelling Juggler would give me $10 total, enough for either Sly Joker ($3) or Director's Cut ($10). The appeal of Sly Joker is clear—pairing it with Splash means every pair I play gets +50 chips, which compounds nicely. However, my recent Four of a Kind already scored 4,180 chips, well above the 3,000 threshold. Boss Blinds scale much higher, so I need to evaluate whether this upgrade is necessary for what's coming.\n\nPluto's High Card boost doesn't help since I'm not using that hand type. I'm weighing whether to grab an Arcana Pack for potential tarot synergies, buy a Standard Pack, or commit to the Sly Joker trade-off. The core question is whether the pair bonus justifies losing hand size, or if I should preserve flexibility with extra cash.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
