{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2 (just completed Big Blind, in SHOP phase)\n- Money: $0\n- Jokers:\n  1. Green Joker (+2 Mult currently)\n  2. Merry Andy (+3 discards, -1 hand size)\n  3. Zany Joker (+12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind)\n  4. Splash (Every played card counts in scoring)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- No shop cards available\n- Jumbo Buffoon Pack - $6 (can't afford)\n- Arcana Pack - $4 (can't afford)\n- Telescope voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $0 left after buying both Zany Joker and Splash. I cannot afford any of the remaining items in the shop:\n- Jumbo Buffoon Pack costs $6\n- Arcana Pack costs $4\n- Telescope voucher costs $10\n- Reroll costs $5\n\nThere are no shop cards left to buy (the card section is empty).\n\nSince I have no money and cannot afford anything else in the shop, the only logical action is to proceed to the next phase by using the `round_select` command. This will take me to the Blind Select screen where I'll choose the next blind to face (which should be the Boss Blind since I just completed the Big Blind of Ante 1).\n\nMy current joker setup is strong for Three of a Kind hands:\n- Green Joker gives +2 Mult (and will increase with each hand played)\n- Zany Joker gives +12 Mult when hand contains Three of a Kind\n- Splash makes all played cards count, not just those in the hand type\n- Merry Andy gives extra discards to help me find the cards I need\n\n\n- This combination should handle the Boss Blind effectively.","action":"\"round_select\""}
