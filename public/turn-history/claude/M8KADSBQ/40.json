{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $0\n- Next challenge: Boss Blind requiring 1600 chips\n- Boss effect: \"Cards drawn face down after each hand played\"\n\n**My Jokers (in order):**\n1. Green Joker: +7 Mult (scales with hands/discards)\n2. Merry Andy: +3 discards, -1 hand size\n3. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n4. Splash: Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mystic Summit: +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 2 (25 chips, 3 mult) - Most played (4 times)\n- Straight: Level 2 (60 chips, 7 mult) - Just upgraded (2 times played)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - Played 3 times\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Neptune (Planet): Level up Straight Flush - Cost: $3 (I can't afford this)\n- Arcana Pack (Booster): Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards - Cost: $4 (I can't afford this)\n- Tarot Merchant (Voucher): Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently - Cost: $10 (I can't afford this)\n- Reroll cost: $5 (I can't afford this either)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $0, so I cannot buy anything else. The only action I can take is to finish shopping and proceed to the blind select screen.\n\nWith my current setup:\n- Green Joker at +7 Mult\n- Mystic Summit at +15 Mult when 0 discards remaining\n\n\n- Zany Joker at +12 Mult if Three of a Kind\n- Splash making every card count\n- Merry Andy giving me 7 discards total\n\nMy strategy is to cycle through my 7 discards strategically, then play hands once I've exhausted them to activate the +22 Mult bonus from Green Joker and Mystic Summit combined. I need to reach 1600 chips against the Boss Blind, so I'll focus on playing high-value hands like Pairs and Straights to accumulate the necessary score.\n\nWith a Pair of Kings and two other cards, I'd get around 1125 chips—not quite enough in a single hand. But a Straight with five cards could yield approximately 2900 chips, which would comfortably exceed my threshold.\n\nThe blind's face-down cards make scoring trickier, though the Splash Joker ensures every card contributes. Since I'm out of funds, I'll move forward with round_select.","action":"\"round_select\""}
