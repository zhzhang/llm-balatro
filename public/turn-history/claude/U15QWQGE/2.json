{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $10\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Just beat the Small Blind (300 chips) with a Full House (324 chips)\n\n**Shop Offers:**\n1. The Hanged Man (Tarot) - Destroys up to 2 selected cards - $3\n2. Popcorn (Joker) - +20 Mult, -4 Mult per round played - Common - $5\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards - $4\n2. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately - $4\n\n**Voucher:**\n1. Overstock - +1 card slot available in shop - $10\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $5\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 450 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, $5 reward, debuffs all Heart cards\n\nLet me analyze my options:\n\n1. **Popcorn Joker ($5)**: Starts at +20 Mult but loses -4 Mult per round. This is good for the short term but degrades quickly. After 5 rounds, it's at 0 Mult.\n\n2. **The Hanged Man ($3)**: Can destroy up to 2 cards. This could be useful for deck manipulation, but early game it's not critical.\n\n3. **Buffoon Pack ($4)**: Get to choose from 2 jokers. This is random but could give me a good joker to start building around.\n\n4. **Celestial Pack ($4)**: Get to choose from 3 planets and use immediately. This levels up a hand type, which is valuable for scaling.\n   \nThe voucher would lock in a permanent shop upgrade for the entire run, which compounds in value. A reroll might surface better options, but it's expensive. To beat the Big Blind at 450 chips, I need roughly 40% more than what my Full House generated. The Boss Blind's Heart debuff is a future concern but manageable if I diversify my hand types.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack appeals to me because it offers choice between two jokers rather than committing to a single card, and leaves me with $6 afterward. Popcorn's +20 Mult multiplier is tempting—it would transform my 81-chip base into something closer to 1,944 chips with the right multiplier scaling, which would comfortably clear both upcoming blinds. The Buffoon Pack seems like the smart play—it gives me a choice between two jokers rather than committing to Popcorn blindly, and I'd still have $6 left over. But actually, I can afford both: Popcorn for $5 plus Buffoon Pack for $4 equals $9, leaving me with just $1. That combination is stronger—I get the guaranteed +20 Mult from Popcorn immediately while also securing another joker option from the pack. I wouldn't need Popcorn. But Popcorn guarantees +20 Mult, which is a solid foundation. The safer approach is securing that multiplier boost first, then using the remaining $5 to grab another joker from the Buffoon Pack.\n\nI'll buy Popcorn.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
