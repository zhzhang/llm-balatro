{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n2: 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n3: 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4: 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n5: 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6: 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card (first hand only)\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n5. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Blind: Big Blind\n- Chips Needed: 7,500\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- I have a pair of 7s (7 of Clubs and 7 of Diamonds)\n- No Three of a Kind\n- No Straight\n- No Flush\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n1. Stuntman limits me to playing only 3 cards maximum\n2. Sixth Sense triggers if I play a single 6 as my first hand - this would destroy the 6 of Spades and create a Spectral card\n3. I need 7,500 chips total\n\n**Option 1: Play the Pair of 7s**\nIf I play both 7s plus one more card:\n- Base chips for Pair: 10\n- Chips from 7 of Clubs: 7\n- Chips from 7 of Diamonds: 7\n\n\n- Chips from third card (e.g., 10 of Hearts): 10\n- Stuntman: +250\n- Total chips: 10 + 7 + 7 + 10 + 250 = 284\n\nMultiplier:\n- Base mult for Pair: 2\n- Onyx Agate adds +7 for the Club 7\n- Total mult: 9\n\nTotal score: 284 × 9 = 2,556 chips. This falls short of what I need.\n\n**Option 2: Use Sixth Sense on the 6**\nPlaying just the 6 of Spades alone would trigger the Spectral card creation, which could open up new scoring possibilities with the Tarot effects from Superposition.\n\nHowever, my consumables are at capacity (2/2), so I'd need to discard or sell something first to make room for the Spectral card.\n\n**Option 3: Discard strategically**\nI could discard cards to hunt for Three of a Kind—which would unlock Zany Joker's +12 Mult boost—or accumulate more Clubs to maximize Onyx Agate's value. With 4 Aces and 2 more 7s still in the deck, there's potential to build toward a stronger hand.\n\nMy best move is to keep both 7s and discard the 9 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 10 of Hearts, and 2 of Hearts. This opens up 4 draw slots while preserving my chances at Three of a Kind and maintaining the Clubs synergy.\n\nI have 4 hands and 4 discards left to reach 7,500 chips. A Three of a Kind with Clubs would leverage the Zany Joker's +12 Mult and Onyx Agate's scaling (+7 Mult per Club), plus Stuntman's flat +250 chips. Even with modest cards, this combination could generate significant value—the base 70 chips for Three of a Kind plus the multiplier effects should push me closer to my target.\n\nSince I only have one Club 7 available, I need to search for additional Club cards or other 7s through strategic discards.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,6]"}
