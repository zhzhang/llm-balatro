{"reasoning":"I need to choose between two Spectral cards from the booster pack:\n\n1. **Aura** - Add Foil, Holographic, or Polychrome effect to 1 selected card in hand\n   - Foil: +50 chips\n   - Holographic: +10 Mult\n   - Polychrome: X1.5 Mult\n\n2. **Wraith** - Creates a random Rare Joker, sets money to $0\n\nLet me analyze:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have $37\n- I'm at Ante 3/8, about to face the Boss Blind\n- Current jokers:\n  - Popcorn: +4 Mult (will be 0 next round, basically useless)\n  - Onyx Agate: +7 Mult per Club scored\n  - Superposition (Foil): +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n  - Sixth Sense: If first hand is single 6, destroy and create Spectral\n- I have 1/5 joker slots available\n- I have The Devil consumable (enhance to Gold Card)\n\n**Aura Analysis:**\n- Would give me a Foil (+50 chips), Holographic (+10 Mult), or Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) edition on a card\n- Polychrome is the best edition, giving X1.5 Mult which is multiplicative\n- This could be very powerful if applied to the right card\n- I keep my $37\n\n**Wraith Analysis:**\n- Creates a random Rare Joker\n- Sets my money to $0\n- Rare jokers can be very powerful\n- But I'd lose all my money ($37)\n- I have 1 joker slot available, so I can take this\n\nThe key question is: Is a random Rare joker worth $37?\n\nLooking at my current setup:\n\n\n- Popcorn becomes worthless next round, so I need stronger scoring to handle the Boss Blind\n- A random Rare joker could provide the multiplicative power I'm missing\n- But spending $37 locks me out of further purchases and leaves me vulnerable if the Rare is underwhelming\n\nWith Aura, I'd apply Polychrome to a high-value card for a permanent X1.5 boost while preserving my purchasing power for future rounds.\n\nLooking at my hand, the Ace stands out as the best target—it's high-value and appears in straights frequently, so the multiplicative gain compounds across multiple hands. I'm also considering whether a Rare joker like Blueprint or Brainstorm could offer better scaling potential, but the guaranteed boost from Polychrome feels more reliable given my current position. played hand) - Midas Mask turns all face cards to Gold when scored, while Luchador sells for $5 and destroys a random joker at double price.

Since I'm facing a Boss Blind, have $37 for flexibility, and Aura plus Polychrome guarantees X1.5 mult on a card, Aura seems like the safer choice over gambling everything on Wraith.\n\nI'll go with Aura and apply Polychrome to my Ace of Diamonds since it has the highest chip value at 11 and works well in multiple hand combinations.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,7]"}
