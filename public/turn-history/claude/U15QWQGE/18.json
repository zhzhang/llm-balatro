{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (Blind Select phase)\n- Money: $4\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +12 Mult (will decrease by 4 each round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind**: \n   - Chips needed: 800\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Tag for skipping: Investment Tag (gain $25 after defeating Boss Blind)\n\n2. **Big Blind**:\n   - Chips needed: 1200\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Tag for skipping: Foil Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n\n3. **Boss Blind**:\n   - Chips needed: 1600\n   - Boss effect: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n   - Reward: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe question is whether to skip the Small Blind to get the Investment Tag or play it.\n\nInvestment Tag gives $25 after defeating the Boss Blind. This is a significant amount of money that could help me buy better jokers and upgrades in future shops.\n\nIf I skip the Small Blind:\n- I get the Investment Tag\n- I remain at $4\n- I go directly to the Big Blind decision\n- After beating the Boss Blind, I'd get $25 + $5 (Boss reward) = $30\n\nIf I play the Small Blind:\n- I need to beat 800 chips\n- I get $3 reward\n- I'd have $7 total\n- After beating all three blinds, I'd have $7 + $4 (Big) + $5 (Boss) = $16\n\nLooking at my hand performance:\n- Straight: 3,321 chips\n\n\n- Two Pair: 1,566 chips\n- High Card: 336 chips\n- Full House: 324 chips\n\nMy current jokers should handle the Small Blind easily—even a Two Pair scored 1,566 chips last round, well above the 800 needed. The real consideration is whether skipping it for the Investment Tag's $25 payout is worth the risk of facing the Big and Boss Blinds without that warmup round. The financial advantage of the tag is substantial, but I need to ensure my hand strength can still clear 1200 and 1600 chips.\n\nLooking at my previous performance, a Straight generated 3,321 chips against the Boss, and my Two Pair consistently hits 1,566. Even with the Diamond debuff limiting that suit's contribution, my Clubs with Onyx Agate should carry the scoring. The gap between what I've demonstrated and what these blinds require feels manageable enough to justify the $25 investment over the $3 small blind payout.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
