{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (just completed Ante 1 Boss Blind)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $8\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +12 Mult (decreases by 4 each round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Devil: Can enhance 1 card into Gold Card ($3 when held at end of round)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Mail-In Rebate: Earn $5 for each discarded Ace - Cost: $4\n  2. Gift Card: Add $1 of sell value to every Joker and Consumable - Cost: $6\n- Boosters:\n  1. Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - Cost: $4\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Reroll Surplus: Rerolls cost $2 less - Cost: $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 6 (just upgraded!)\n- Straight: Level 1\n- Full House: Level 1\n- Two Pair: Level 1\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Straight: 3,321 chips (Boss Blind)\n- Two Pair: 1,566 chips\n- Full House: 324 chips\n- High Card: 336 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $8 remaining after buying the first Celestial Pack and upgrading Flush to Level 2.\n\nOptions:\n1. Buy the second Celestial Pack for $4 - This would leave me with $4, and I could potentially upgrade another hand type like Straight, Two Pair, or Full House.\n\n\n2. Mail-In Rebate could generate $5 per Ace discarded, though I only have 2 Aces left in my deck, making this a limited income source. 3. Gift Card for $6 would leave me with $2 and generate $3 per round from my current Jokers and Consumable, which is a slow but steady income stream.\n\nThe Celestial Pack stands out as the strongest play—upgrading another hand type like Straight or Full House would directly boost my scoring potential, similar to how leveling Flush improved my chip output. Rerolling the shop for $5 is possible but might waste resources, while saving my $8 gives me flexibility for future rounds. The Mail-In Rebate feels too limited with only 2 Aces remaining to make it worthwhile.\n\nI'm leaning toward the second Celestial Pack at $4, which leaves me with $4 for the next shop and positions me better for Ante 2's tougher requirements. I should also monitor Popcorn's declining effectiveness—it'll drop to +8 Mult after this round, so I may need to shift my strategy soon.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
