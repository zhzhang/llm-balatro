{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1, in BUFFOON_PACK phase\n- Money: $1\n- Current Joker: Popcorn (+20 Mult, -4 Mult per round played)\n- Need to choose 1 of 2 joker cards from the booster pack\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. To Do List - Earn $4 if poker hand is a Four of a Kind, poker hand changes at end of round (Common)\n2. Onyx Agate - Played cards with Club suit give +7 Mult when scored (Uncommon)\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 450 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, debuffs all Heart cards\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith Popcorn, my Full House (81 chips × 24 mult = 1,944 chips) is already way more than enough for both blinds.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**To Do List:**\n- Requires playing Four of a Kind to earn $4\n- The hand type changes at end of round\n- This is conditional income, which could be nice but:\n  - I need to specifically play Four of a Kind\n  - Looking at my last hand (three 9s and two 7s), I had a Full House\n  - From the deck composition shown in Turn 2, I had only 1 nine remaining in deck (out of 4 total, with 3 in my hand)\n  - Making Four of a Kind is harder than Full House\n  - The bonus is only $4 and only if I play that specific hand type\n  - The hand type changes each round, so inconsistent\n\n**Onyx Agate:**\n- Played cards with Club suit give +7 Mult when scored\n- This is always active when I play Club cards\n- Looking at my last hand: I had 9 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs available\n\n\n- With 10 Clubs still in the deck, I'll have consistent access to Club cards throughout the run\n- Each Club card adds +7 Mult reliably, so playing three Clubs means +21 Mult on top of Popcorn's +20\n- This synergy compounds my scoring power without requiring specific hand types\n- Onyx Agate outperforms To Do List since it triggers naturally with Club cards rather than demanding Four of a Kind hands, making it far more dependable for consistent scaling\n- The Boss Blind specifically weakens Hearts, leaving my Club strategy unaffected\n- Onyx Agate's rarity and multiplicative stacking with Popcorn make it the superior choice\n\nI'm going with Onyx Agate.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
