{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $34\n\n**Jokers (5/5 - FULL):**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n5. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n\n**Consumables (2/2 - FULL):**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card\n2. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- The World (Tarot): Converts up to 3 cards to Spades - $3\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Jumbo Standard Pack: $6\n- Planet Merchant Voucher: $10\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI'm on Ante 4/8, so I'm halfway through the game. Looking at my recent performance:\n- Three of a Kind is working well (6,342 chips and 2,295 chips)\n- High Card with Clubs is also solid (2,520 chips)\n- Flush worked well (5,617 chips)\n\nMy current build focuses on:\n1. Playing Clubs for Onyx Agate's +7 Mult per Club\n2. Three of a Kind for Zany Joker's +12 Mult\n3. Stuntman for +250 chips on every hand\n\nNext blind will be the Big Blind, and after that will be the Boss Blind for Ante 4.\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\n\nThe World would convert cards to Spades, which conflicts with my Club strategy, so that's not aligned with my current approach. Standard Pack offers decent value at $4 for potential enhanced cards or more Clubs. Jumbo Standard Pack gives better odds but costs $6. Planet Merchant at $10 doesn't fit my current gameplan since I'm not leveraging planets. A Reroll for $5 could refresh these options, though my current offerings aren't terrible.\n\nFor consumables, The Devil grants $3 held value and can upgrade a card to Gold, while Mars levels up Four of a Kind—a hand I'm not prioritizing right now. Looking at the bigger picture, Ante 4's Big Blind will demand 7,500-10,000 chips minimum, with the Boss Blind requiring even more. My joker slots are maxed out, and Sixth Sense feels narrow since it only triggers when a single 6 is my opening hand. Superposition provides solid chip generation and Tarot access when I hit Ace+Straight combinations. I'm weighing whether to use Mars on Four of a Kind before progressing, apply The Devil to enhance a key card, grab a booster pack to strengthen my deck, or simply advance to the next round. Consider buying a booster pack to strengthen the deck, though with $34 in hand there's enough cushion to skip this round. Selling Mars would free up space and provide a dollar, but the real question is whether to use The Devil on a Club card for passive income—getting $3 at end of round plus the chip bonuses could be worthwhile. For now, proceeding to the next round and preserving funds seems like the safer play, especially with the Big Blind approaching.","action":"\"round_select\""}
