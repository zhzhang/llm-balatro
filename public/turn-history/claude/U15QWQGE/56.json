{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Current Blind: Small (5000 chips needed)\n- Money: $28\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n3. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have 4 clubs: King of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs\nI have 2 spades: 10 of Spades, 4 of Spades\n\nI was trying to get a 5th club for a flush, but I drew spades instead. Let me check what hands I can make:\n\n**Option 1: Two Pair (10s and clubs?)**\nWait, I only have one pair of 10s (10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs). I don't have another pair.\n\n**Option 2: Pair of 10s**\n- 10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs\n- Base: 10 chips, 2 mult (Level 1)\n- Stuntman: +250 chips\n- Cards in pair: 10 Spades (+10) + 10 Clubs (+10) = 20 chips\n\n\n- Total chips: 10 + 250 + 20 = 280 chips\n- Multiplier: 2 (base) + 7 (from 10 of Clubs via Onyx Agate) = 9 mult\n- Total: 280 × 9 = 2,520 chips\n\nStill short of the 5000 needed. With 2 discards remaining and 9 clubs left in the deck, I could try drawing for a flush. Alternatively, I could play a high card hand with all the face cards and clubs to maximize Onyx Agate's multiplier bonus.\n\nIf I play the four clubs as a high card, the base is 5 chips plus 250 from Stuntman and 50 from Superposition, giving 315 chips total. The multiplier would be 1 base plus 28 from the four clubs (4 × 7), reaching 29x. That's 315 × 29 = 9,135 chips—well above the threshold. But I need to verify how high card scoring actually works, since only the highest card's base chips count. of the highest hand made by the cards played.\" In a high card hand, all cards participate, so each club triggers Onyx Agate. However, only the highest card's chip value counts—the King of Clubs adds +10 to the base 5 chips plus the joker bonuses for 315 total chips. With all 4 clubs scoring, that's 28 multiplier from Onyx Agate, bringing the total to 29 mult and 9,135 chips. I should consider playing all 5 cards to see if that improves the outcome further.\n\nIf I add the 10 of Spades or 4 of Spades, I risk creating a Pair instead of a High Card, which changes the hand evaluation. Sticking with just the 4 clubs guarantees the High Card hand and the 9,135 chip result. Alternatively, I could discard again hoping to draw a 5th club for a flush—with 9 clubs remaining in 41 cards, the probability is decent. Let me evaluate whether that's worth pursuing.\n\nI still have 2 discards and 4 hands remaining. Even if I discard now and miss the club, I'd have 1 discard left with 4 hands to play. Since the High Card with 4 clubs already exceeds 5000 chips, playing it now is the safer choice and preserves my remaining discards and hands for future rounds. I'll go with positions 3, 4, 5, 6.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6]"}
