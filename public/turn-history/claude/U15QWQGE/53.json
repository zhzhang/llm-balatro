{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state and decide on the best action.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $28\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind**: 5000 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Skip tag: D6 Tag (Rerolls in next shop start at $0)\n2. **Big Blind**: 7500 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip tag: Orbital Tag (Upgrade poker hand by 3 levels)\n3. **Boss Blind**: 10000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss Description: Must play 5 cards\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size (so I have 6 cards instead of 8)\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card\n2. Mars - Levels up Four of a Kind\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult)\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1 (60 chips, 7 mult)\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Flush - 5,617 chips (Ante 3 Boss)\n- Three of a Kind - 2,295 chips\n- Pair - 1,156 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent hands, I was able to achieve 5,617 chips with a Flush and 2,295 chips with Three of a Kind. \n\nThe Small Blind seems manageable at 5000 chips given my recent performance, though the D6 Tag reward is modest. The Big Blind's Orbital Tag stands out—upgrading any hand by 3 levels would significantly boost my scoring potential, especially Four of a Kind which is currently at Level 1. The Boss Blind's 5-card constraint aligns with my Stuntman setup but limits my flexibility. I need to weigh whether I can reliably hit 7500 chips to unlock that powerful hand upgrade. The Small Blind is winnable with my current deck, and skipping the Big Blind nets me the Orbital Tag—a massive power spike that lets me level up any hand by three tiers. Combined, these moves position me perfectly to take down the Boss.","action":"\"play_round\""}
