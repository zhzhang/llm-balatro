{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\nCurrent hand:\n1: 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n2: 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n3: 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n4: Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5: Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6: 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n7: 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n8: 2 of Diamonds (debuffed - scores no chips)\n\nI need 1600 chips total.\nRemaining hands: 4\nRemaining discards: 3\n\nJokers:\n- Popcorn: +12 Mult\n- Onyx Agate: Played cards with Club suit give +7 Mult when scored\n\nLet me look at possible hands:\n\n1. Three of a Kind (three 2s: 2H, 2C, 2D)\n   - Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n   - Card chips: 2H (+2) + 2C (+2) + 2D (0, debuffed) = 4\n   - Total chips: 54\n   - Base mult: 5\n   - Popcorn: +12\n   - Onyx Agate: 2C is a club, so +7\n   - Total mult: 5 + 12 + 7 = 24\n   - Total score: 54 × 24 = 1,296 chips\n\n2. Flush (four clubs: Ace, Jack, 6, 2)\n   - Base chips: 50 (Level 2)\n   - Card chips: 11 + 10 + 6 + 2 = 29\n   - Total chips: 79\n   - Base mult: 6\n   - Popcorn: +12\n   - Onyx Agate: Each club card gives +7 mult when scored\n   - So that's 4 clubs × 7 = +28 mult\n   - Total mult: 6 + 12 + 28 = 46\n   - Total score: 79 × 46 = 3,634 chips\n\nThe flush significantly outperforms the three of a kind. I should play the four clubs from positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 to maximize my score.\n\nLet me verify the card composition: Ace, Jack, 6, and 2 of Clubs give me 79 chips (50 base plus 11 + 10 + 6 + 2 from each card) and 46 multiplier (6 base, 12 from Popcorn, and 28 from Onyx Agate triggering on all four cards).\n\nThat multiplies to 3,634 chips—well above the 1,600 threshold, so this is definitely the play.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7]"}
