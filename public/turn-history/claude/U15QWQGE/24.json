Popcorn: +12 Mult (will become +8 after this round)\\n2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\\n\\nLet me analyze possible hands:\\n- I have three 2s (2H, 2C, 2D), but the 2D is debuffed. So I could potentially play a pair of 2s (2H and 2C).\\n- I don't have a straight\\n- I don't have a flush (only 3 hearts max, 2 clubs)\\n- I could play the pair of 2s (2H and 2C)\\n\\nWait, let me reconsider. The debuffed diamonds can still form hand types, they just don't contribute chips or abilities.\\n\\nSo I have:\\n- Three 2s total (2H, 2C, 2D)\\n- That's a three of a kind!\\n\\nThree of a Kind is Level 2: Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5\\n\\nLet me calculate if I play the three 2s:\\nBase chips: 50\\nCards that contribute: 2H (+2), 2C (+2), 2D is debuffed so +0\\nTotal chips: 50 + 2 + 2 = 54 chips\\n\\n\\nBase mult: 5, Popcorn adds +12, and the 2C triggers Onyx Agate for +7, giving me 24 total mult. That scores 54 \\u00d7 24 = 1,296 chips. I'm still short of 1600, but with four hands remaining I can build toward the goal. Let me consider whether discarding might yield better cards instead.\\n\\nLooking at my remaining deck\\u201444 cards with only one more 2 available\\u2014I'm weighing whether to play this three of a kind or try for something stronger. The King of Diamonds is dead weight, and while the 2 of Diamonds is debuffed, it still counts toward the hand type. I could discard some cards to draw fresh ones, particularly focusing on the non-diamond cards I'm holding: Jack of Spades, Ace of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, and 2 of Hearts.\\n\\nI notice I have a pair of 2s (2H, 2C) that would score only 294 chips\\u2014far below what the three of a kind produces. Since I have 4 hands remaining and limited draws, playing the three 2s now seems like my strongest option rather than gambling on better hands through discards.\\n\\nBut I should reconsider the discard strategy. The King of Diamonds and 2 of Diamonds are both debuffed, making them seem like prime candidates to remove. However, the 2D is crucial to my three of a kind, so discarding it would drop me to just a pair. Even though the 2D doesn't contribute chips due to the debuff, it still counts toward the hand type itself. I need to weigh whether keeping this three of a kind is better than hoping to draw something stronger. card the King of Diamonds and 4 of Hearts to try for better cards. The three of a kind gives me about 1,296 chips, which means I'd need 304 more across my remaining 3 hands\\u2014that's achievable if I can draw something stronger. Discarding the debuffed King and low-value 4 of Hearts while keeping my three of a kind seems like the better play than committing to this hand now. would leave me with just the three of a kind (2H, 2C, 2D). That's exactly 5 cards to discard, so I'll go with that strategy.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 5 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 23]\\nAnte: 2/8, Round: 4\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Popcorn.
