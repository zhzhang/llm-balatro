{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6 (in shop phase)\n- Money: $41\n- I just won the Boss blind of Ante 3 with a flush\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into a Gold Card\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Oops! All 6s - Doubles all listed probabilities - $4\n2. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size - $7\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n2. Jumbo Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Planet Merchant - Planet cards appear 2X more in shop - $10\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm entering Ante 4, which means the chip requirements will be significantly higher. Let me think about my current strategy:\n\n1. My main combo is Onyx Agate with Clubs, which worked well in the last round\n2. Superposition gives +50 chips and creates Tarot cards with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense can create Spectral cards if I play a single 6 on the first hand\n\nLooking at the shop options:\n\n**Oops! All 6s** - This doubles probabilities, but I don't have any probability-based effects currently. This might be useful if I get Lucky Cards or other probability-based jokers later, but not immediately useful.\n\n\nStuntman offers a substantial chip boost but cuts my hand size significantly—trading flexibility for raw scoring power. The Standard Pack could help me find more Clubs to strengthen my Onyx Agate synergy, while the Jumbo Arcana Pack provides card manipulation options. Planet Merchant would accelerate my ability to level up hands through repeated planet card access, though it's expensive at $10.\n\nAt Ante 4, I need to weigh immediate chip gains against long-term scaling. Stuntman's +250 chips is tempting for meeting higher thresholds, but Jumbo Arcana Pack's potential for card enhancements might give me more flexibility. Rerolling could surface better jokers or planet cards entirely. I'm leaning toward either Stuntman for the direct chip injection or Jumbo Arcana Pack for the strategic modifications, depending on what other options appear.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
