{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (Big Blind)\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Money: $1\n- Chips Needed: 450\n- Current Chips: 336 (from the previous hand I played)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**Progress:**\nI need 450 chips total and already have 336 chips. I need just 114 more chips to win this blind.\n\n**Owned Jokers:**\n1. Popcorn: +20 Mult -4 Mult per round played. This is Round 2, so it should be +16 Mult (20 - 4 = 16)\n2. Onyx Agate: Played cards with Club suit give +7 Mult when scored\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n4. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n5. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n7. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLet me look for pairs or better:\n- Two 7s (7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs)\n- Two 4s (4 of Hearts, 4 of Diamonds)\n- Two Jacks (Jack of Spades, Jack of Diamonds)\n\nI have THREE pairs! This means I can play:\n- Two Pair (best option with the highest cards)\n- Or just a Pair\n\nLet me calculate Two Pair with 7s and Jacks:\n- Jack of Spades (+10)\n\n\n- Jack of Diamonds (+10)\n- 7 of Hearts (+7)\n- 7 of Clubs (+7)\n\nTwo Pair gives 20 base chips and 2x mult. The card values total 34 chips, so with the Popcorn Joker's 16 mult and Onyx Agate's bonus on the 7 of Clubs, I should reach the 114 chips needed. mult: 2\n- Jack of Spades: +10\n- Jack of Diamonds: +10\n- 7 of Clubs: +7\n- Total chips: 10 + 10 + 10 + 7 = 37\n- Popcorn mult: +16\n- Onyx Agate (7 of Clubs): +7\n- Total mult: 2 + 16 + 7 = 25\n- Score: 37 × 25 = 925 chips\n\nEven a pair is more than enough! But Two Pair is objectively better and I should play it to be safe.\n\nLet me play: Jack of Spades (1), Jack of Diamonds (7), 7 of Hearts (3), 7 of Clubs (5)\n\nTwo Pair calculation:\n- Base chips: 20\n- Jack of Spades: +10\n- Jack of Diamonds: +10\n- 7 of Hearts: +7\n- 7 of Clubs: +7\n- Total chips: 20 + 10 + 10 + 7 + 7 = 54\n- Base mult: 2\n- Popcorn: +16\n- Onyx Agate (1 Club): +7\n- Total mult: 2 + 16 + 7 = 25\n- Final score: 54 × 25 = 1,350\n\nCombined with the previous hand, I'll have 336 + 1,350 = 1,686 chips, well above the 450 threshold. The command is: play 1 7 3 5 two pair 1350","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,7,3,5]"}
