{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (just beat Big Blind, now in shop)\n- Money: $41\n- Next up: Boss Blind (which will be significantly harder)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Popcorn - +4 Mult (degrading, will be 0 next round)\n2. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n3. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n4. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card (just bought)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhance card to Gold Card ($3 per round when held)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Justice (Tarot) - $3 - Enhance to Glass Card (X2 Mult, 1 in 4 chance to destroy)\n2. Spectral Pack - $4\n3. Standard Pack - $4\n4. Overstock Voucher - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nKey considerations:\n1. I'm about to face a Boss Blind which will have special challenging effects\n2. Popcorn will be at 0 Mult next round, making it useless - I should consider selling it\n3. I have $41 to spend and 1 joker slot available (4/5 used)\n4. I have 1 consumable slot available (1/2 used)\n\nStrategic Options:\n\n1. **Spectral Pack ($4)** - Spectral cards are very powerful and can provide game-changing effects:\n   - Ankh (copy joker)\n   - Soul (create legendary joker)\n   - Wraith (create random rare joker)\n   - Familiar (destroy 1 card, enhance 3 to random suit)\n   - Incantation (destroy 1 card, enhance 4 to random rank)\n   - Talisman (add gold seal to 1 card)\n   - Aura (add foil/holo/polychrome to 1 card)\n   - Sigil (convert all cards to one suit)\n   - Ouija (convert all cards to one rank)\n   - Ectoplasm (+4 hands each round but can't earn money)\n   - Immolate (destroys 5 cards, get $20)\n   - Trance (creates a Planet card)\n   - Medium (creates a Spectral card)\n\nThe Spectral Pack offers incredible upside potential - cards like Ankh or Soul could fundamentally shift my run's trajectory. Even utility options like Sigil or Ouija could enable powerful hand combinations. Given my budget and the difficulty spike ahead, this seems like a high-value investment. improve my deck.\n\nWith the Boss Blind approaching, I need to prioritize strength. My Three of a Kind is already Level 3, Onyx Agate provides solid Mult on Clubs, and Superposition consistently adds chips. Since I have $41 available and open consumable slots, the Spectral Pack at $4 is worth the investment—Black Hole alone would level up all poker hands, and Soul could grant a legendary joker.\n\nAfter securing that, I could liquidate Popcorn for $2 since it won't be useful next round, or look for Justice if space permits. Rerolling might reveal better options too. I'll go ahead and purchase the Spectral Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
