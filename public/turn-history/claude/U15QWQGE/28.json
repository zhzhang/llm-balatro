{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase after buying a Celestial Pack. I need to choose one of three planet cards:\n\n1. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult, +15 chips) - Currently Level 1 (10 chips, 2 mult), never played\n2. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult, +20 chips) - Currently Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult), never played\n3. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult, +30 chips) - Currently Level 1 (60 chips, 7 mult), never played\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- Two Pair: Played 2 times (most recent was 966 chips)\n- High Card: Played 4 times \n- Straight: Played 1 time (3,321 chips - very strong!)\n- Full House: Played 1 time\n- Pair: Never played\n- Three of a Kind: Never played (despite being Level 2)\n- Four of a Kind: Never played\n\nMy current jokers:\n1. Popcorn: +8 Mult (degrading)\n2. Onyx Agate: +7 Mult for Club cards\n3. Superposition: Creates Tarot when Ace + Straight, +50 chips\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- I have Superposition which synergizes with Straights, but Straight isn't one of the options here\n- Two Pair has been my most consistent hand type\n- Pair is a component of Two Pair - if I level up Pair, it also improves Two Pair since Two Pair \"contains\" a Pair\n- Three of a Kind is already Level 2 but I haven't played it - Venus would push it to Level 3\n- Four of a Kind is harder to hit but gives big payoffs\n\nLooking at the game progression:\n\n\n- I'm in Ante 3/8, so chip requirements are increasing\n- Popcorn is degrading and will need replacement\n- I need to build toward consistent scoring strategies\n\nConsidering the options: Mercury would strengthen Pair, which supports my Two Pair strategy that's already working. Venus would advance Three of a Kind to Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult), making it more viable despite never playing it yet. Mars offers the biggest multiplier boost but Four of a Kind is the hardest to trigger and I haven't used it at all.\n\nSince I've successfully played Two Pair twice and Pairs are reliable to hit, upgrading Mercury seems like the safest path forward. However, I'm second-guessing myself—my last boss round needed 1600 chips but Two Pair only generated 966, so I might need something with higher power potential like Mars for future rounds.\n\nLooking at Three of a Kind more carefully: at Level 3 it would give 70 base chips and 7 mult, and with my current jokers—Popcorn adding 8 mult, Onyx Agate adding 7 mult for clubs, plus 50 chips from Superposition—a Three of a Kind hand with clubs would multiply to roughly (120 + card values) × 22. That's substantially stronger than what Pair upgrades would provide. Meanwhile, upgrading Pair to Level 2 only gets me 25 chips and 3 mult as the base, which feels underwhelming compared to what Three of a Kind could deliver.\n\nFour of a Kind at Level 2 is worth considering though—it starts at 90 chips with 10 mult, and with the same joker bonuses that becomes (140 + card values) × 25, which actually outpaces the Three of a Kind scaling.\n\nHowever, Four of a Kind is significantly harder to assemble than Three of a Kind. Since I've already invested in leveling Three of a Kind to Level 2 and haven't utilized it yet, upgrading it to Level 3 with Venus would finally put that prior investment to work. Three of a Kind strikes the right balance between consistency and power.\n\nI'm going with Venus at position 2.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
