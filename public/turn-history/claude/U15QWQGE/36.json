{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (just completed the Big Blind)\n- Money: $41\n- I'm in the SHOP phase\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers: Popcorn (+4 Mult now, was +8 but loses 4 per round), Onyx Agate (+7 Mult per Club scored), Superposition (Foil, +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight)\n- Consumables: The Devil (enhance to Gold Card)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 3)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 1)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Sixth Sense (Uncommon Joker) - Free! (from Uncommon Tag) - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n2. Justice (Tarot) - $3 - Enhance card to Glass Card (X2 Mult, 1 in 4 chance to destroy)\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Spectral Pack - $4\n2. Standard Pack - $4\n\n**Voucher:**\n1. Overstock - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just beat the Big Blind and am now at the shop. I need to prepare for the Boss Blind which will be much harder.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. **Popcorn is degrading** - It started at +8 Mult and is now at +4 Mult. It loses 4 Mult per round played. It will be at 0 Mult next round, making it essentially useless going forward. I should consider selling it.\n\n2. **Free Uncommon Joker** - I should take the Sixth Sense joker for free. Even if it's situational (requires playing a single 6 as the first hand), it's free and creates Spectral cards which are powerful.\n\n\n3. The Devil could turn a card into Gold, generating $3 per round passively. Justice offers X2 Mult on Glass Cards but carries destruction risk. Spectral Packs are valuable since Spectral cards provide unique powerful effects. I need to balance my remaining joker slots and consumable space while building toward the Boss Blind challenge ahead.\n\nWith $41 available, I should prioritize the free Sixth Sense joker first, then evaluate whether the Spectral Pack's potential for game-changing cards like Ankh or Soul justifies the $4 cost. I could also consider rerolling to see if better options emerge, though the Spectral Pack's upside is compelling given how dramatically those cards can shift momentum.\n\nLooking at my current jokers, Popcorn is fading fast while Superposition remains strong—this makes getting a reliable new joker even more important. The Spectral Pack could provide exactly that kind of breakthrough I need to push through the remaining bosses.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
