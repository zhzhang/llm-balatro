{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the tarot pack choices and decide which card to select from the Jumbo Arcana Pack.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Ante 4/8, in shop (tarot pack selection)\n- Money: $28\n- Jokers:\n  1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n  2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n  3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n  4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n\n- Consumables: The Devil (enhance 1 card to Gold Card)\n- Max consumables: 2 (I have 1/2)\n\nTarot options:\n1. The Fool - Creates Venus (level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips) - Three of a Kind is already Level 3\n2. Death - Convert left card into right card\n3. The High Priestess - Creates up to 2 random Planet cards\n4. The Hanged Man - Destroys up to 2 selected cards\n5. The Magician - Enhances 2 cards to Lucky Cards (1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult, 1 in 15 chance to win $20)\n\nCurrent hand:\n1. 4 of Spades\n2. Ace of Hearts\n3. 9 of Hearts\n4. 6 of Clubs\n5. 3 of Clubs\n6. 10 of Diamonds\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. **The Fool** - Would give me Venus to level up Three of a Kind again. My Three of a Kind is already Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult), and leveling it further would make it even stronger. This is useful since I've been playing Three of a Kind successfully.\n\n2. **Death** - Allows me to convert one card into another. \n\nDeath could let me duplicate cards for stronger pairs or three of a kinds, or shift cards to Clubs to maximize my Onyx Agate synergy. The High Priestess generates up to 2 Planet cards for hand scaling, which is valuable for progression. The Hanged Man thins my deck by destroying cards, though this doesn't feel urgent right now. The Magician makes 2 Lucky Cards with probabilistic bonuses—potentially strong but unreliable.\n\nGiven my focus on Clubs for Onyx Agate scaling, my Stuntman chip boost, and my leveled hands, The High Priestess stands out for the flexibility it provides. The Fool would push Three of a Kind even higher, which is tempting. The Magician's inconsistency makes it less appealing despite my two Clubs in hand.\n\nThe High Priestess edges ahead because it grants up to 2 Planet cards for leveling any hand I need as Ante 4 approaches with steeper chip requirements. I have room for one more consumable, so I'd gain at least one Planet card. Though The Fool's guaranteed Venus upgrade to Level 4 Three of a Kind is strong, the flexibility of choosing which hand to level feels more valuable heading into tougher rounds. consumable room for it. The Fool offers a guaranteed boost to a hand I've already proven effective with, while The High Priestess provides adaptability across different hands. I'll choose The High Priestess for the strategic flexibility it offers.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
