{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $30\n\n**Current Blind Options:**\n1. Small Blind: 2000 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Skip reward: Uncommon Tag (free Uncommon Joker in shop)\n2. Big Blind: 3000 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip reward: Handy Tag ($1 per played hand this run = $8)\n3. Boss Blind: 4000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss effect: All Spade cards are debuffed\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Popcorn: +8 Mult (degrading, -4 per round)\n2. Onyx Agate: +7 Mult for Club cards\n3. Superposition (Foil): Creates Tarot when Ace + Straight, +50 chips\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Devil: Enhances 1 card to Gold Card\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - Never played but just upgraded!\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) - Never played\n- Straight: Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult) - Played once for 3,321 chips\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - Played twice\n- Full House: Level 1 (40 chips, 4 mult) - Played once\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nShould I play or skip the Small Blind?\n\nIf I skip:\n- I get an Uncommon Tag which gives me a free Uncommon Joker in the next shop\n- I lose the $3 reward for beating the blind\n\n\n- I move directly to the Big Blind decision\n\nIf I play:\n- I need to score 2000 chips\n- I earn $3 plus interest\n- I can test my upgraded Three of a Kind\n\nLet me estimate the score potential. Three of a Kind with Clubs would give me 70 base chips plus 7 mult, and with three Club cards I'd add roughly 30 chips from the cards themselves. Superposition adds 50 chips if I hit the right conditions. With Popcorn and Onyx Agate both active, I'm looking at significant multiplier stacking—the Onyx Agate alone gives +7 mult for Club cards, and Popcorn adds +8 mult. This could easily exceed 2000 chips.\n\nThe Uncommon Tag is tempting since it grants a free Uncommon Joker, and Popcorn is degrading so it'll weaken over time. But I have $30 available, which means I could purchase a joker anyway if needed. I should weigh whether the guaranteed free joker is worth skipping the immediate chip gain and money.\n\nThe Boss Blind debuffs Spades, preventing them from contributing chips or triggering effects, though they still count toward hand composition. Since my Onyx Agate synergizes with Clubs rather than Spades, this actually works in my favor.\n\nSkipping the Small Blind for the Uncommon Tag seems like the right call. Popcorn will degrade to +4 Mult next round and eventually become useless, so I need a replacement soon. An Uncommon Joker would normally cost $6-7, making this tag effectively save me money. With $30 in hand, I'm not relying on the Small Blind's $3 reward, and the Big Blind's 3000 chips is manageable with my current setup.\n\nThe Handy Tag from skipping Big Blind only yields $8, which isn't particularly strong. However, I should weigh whether playing Small Blind instead might be better—it gives me $3, lets me test my Three of a Kind build, and keeps my economy moving while still leaving room to shop afterward. The net difference between skipping and playing is only about $4-5 in value.\n\nBut the free Uncommon Joker tips the scales. I get to pick from available options in the shop, it preserves my cash for other needs, and Popcorn is becoming a liability that needs addressing soon. I'll skip the Small Blind.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
