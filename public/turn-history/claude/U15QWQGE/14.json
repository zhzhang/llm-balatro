{"reasoning":"I need to analyze the current situation and choose the best planet card from the booster pack.\n\nCurrent State:\n- I'm in a Celestial Pack (Planet Pack) where I must choose 1 of 3 planet cards\n- The options are:\n  1. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult and +15 chips)\n  2. Jupiter - Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips)\n  3. Pluto - Level up High Card (+1 Mult and +10 chips)\n\nLet me look at my hand history:\n- Straight - 3,321 chips (most recent, Ante 1 Boss)\n- Two Pair - 1,566 chips\n- High Card - 336 chips\n- Full House - 324 chips\n\nCurrent Hand Levels:\n- Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 10, Base Mult 2\n- Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4\n- High Card: Level 1, Base Chips 5, Base Mult 1\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. **Mercury (Pair)**: Would upgrade Pair from 10 chips/2 mult to 25 chips/3 mult\n   - Pair is a common hand type and versatile\n   - I haven't played it yet this run, but it's easy to make\n   - With my Popcorn joker at +12 mult, a pair would give decent scoring\n\n2. **Jupiter (Flush)**: Would upgrade Flush from 35 chips/4 mult to 50 chips/6 mult\n   - Flush is harder to make (need 5 cards of same suit)\n   - I haven't played it yet this run\n   - With Onyx Agate, Club flushes would be very strong\n   - Flush is a higher-value hand than Pair\n\n3. **Pluto (High Card)**: Would upgrade High Card from 5 chips/1 mult to 15 chips/2 mult\n   - High Card has only appeared once for 336 chips and serves as a backup option\n   - It's not a core part of my strategy\n   - This upgrade offers the least value\n\nMy jokers provide important context: Popcorn gives +12 Mult but declines each round, while Onyx Agate rewards Club cards with +7 Mult. As I move into Ante 2 with higher chip requirements, I need sustainable scoring beyond Popcorn's declining value. Jupiter synergizes well with my Onyx Agate since Club-heavy flush hands would benefit significantly from that multiplier boost.\n\nComparing the hand upgrades: Mercury would make Pairs more reliable at 25 chips/3 mult, but Jupiter targets a higher-value hand type. The real advantage of Jupiter is the Onyx Agate synergy—a five-card Club flush would generate +35 mult just from that joker alone. With 13 clubs available, building toward Club flushes is feasible. Jupiter is the strongest choice because it upgrades a more valuable hand, creates powerful synergy with my existing joker, and gives me a clear path to consistent scoring.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
