{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (in shop before Boss Blind)\n- Money: $34\n- Next: Boss Blind of Ante 3\n\n**Current Jokers (3/5 slots):**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n\n**Current Consumables (1/2 slots):**\n1. The Devil - Enhance card to Gold Card ($3 per round when held)\n\n**Shop Offerings After Reroll:**\n1. Earth (Planet) - $3 - Level up Full House (+2 Mult and +25 chips)\n2. Egg (Joker) - $4 - Gains $3 of sell value at end of round (Common)\n3. Standard Pack - $4\n4. Overstock Voucher - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n- Next Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- I have a Polychrome Ace of Diamonds (X1.5 Mult) from the previous Aura spectral card\n- My strongest hand type is Three of a Kind (Level 3, 70 chips, 7 mult)\n- I have 2 empty joker slots (3/5 used)\n- I'm about to face a Boss Blind which will have special challenging effects\n\n**Analysis of Shop Options:**\n\n1. **Earth (Planet Card) - $3**\n   - Levels up Full House from Level 1 (40 chips, 4 mult) to Level 2 (65 chips, 6 mult)\n   - I've only played Full House once (in previous games)\n   - Full House isn't my primary hand anyway—Three of a Kind is what I'm building around, so this doesn't align with my current strategy\n\n2. **Egg (Joker) - $4**\n   - Purely economic value with no immediate combat benefit\n   - Gains $3 per round but won't help me survive the Boss Blind\n\n3. **Standard Pack - $4**\n   - Adds a card to my deck but doesn't strengthen existing hands\n\n4. **Overstock Vou cher - $10**\n   - Permanently expands my shop by one slot\n   - Expensive at $10 and would leave me with only $24 remaining\n\nI need jokers that directly boost my scoring against the Boss Blind. With two empty slots, I'm looking for multiplicative effects or consistent chip generation. My current jokers—Onyx Agate for Club multiplier, Superposition for chips and Tarot access, and Polychrome Ace for X1.5 multiplier—give me a foundation, but this shop roll doesn't offer anything that strengthens that. The Egg is purely economic, Earth doesn't help my main hands, and the pack is too slow. I should reroll again for $6 to find something with actual scaling potential. money to spare. If the next shop doesn't offer anything better, I can still afford to proceed to the Boss Blind with $28 remaining.\n\nLooking at my hand performance, Three of a Kind has been consistently strong—my last play scored 2,295 chips compared to 1,156 with a Pair. The Polychrome Ace and Onyx Agate are contributing well. While I could diversify into Straight or Full House, my current strategy is working effectively, so I should focus on finding jokers that complement what's already succeeding rather than pivoting my approach.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
