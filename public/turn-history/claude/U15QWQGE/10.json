{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 just completed\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $4\n- Next blind: Boss Blind (requires 600 chips, debuffs all Heart cards)\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +16 Mult (will be +12 next round due to -4 per round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Devil: Enhances 1 card into Gold Card (Gold cards give $3 when held at end of round)\n- Money: $4\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Crafty Joker: +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush - Cost: $4\n- Boosters:\n  1. Mega Celestial Pack: Choose 2 of up to 5 Planet cards - Cost: $8 (can't afford)\n  2. Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - Cost: $4\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Overstock: +1 card slot in shop - Cost: $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll Cost: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have The Devil consumable that I just bought. The next blind is a Boss Blind that debuffs Heart cards. I need to decide what to do in this shop.\n\nOptions:\n1. Use The Devil on a card to make it Gold (gives $3 at end of round)\n2. Buy Crafty Joker for $4 (all my money)\n3. Buy Arcana Pack for $4 (all my money)\n4. Just proceed to round_select\n\nLet me think about using The Devil:\n- Gold cards give $3 when held at end of round\n\n\n- This provides economic value, but I can't use The Devil right now since I'm in the shop without cards in hand to target. I'd need to wait until I'm in an actual round to apply it to a card I'm holding.\n\nGiven my constraints, I should consider whether Crafty Joker or the Arcana Pack would be more valuable. The Crafty Joker adds chip value for Flush hands, which could help with the upcoming Boss Blind, but I haven't built toward Flush hands yet.\n\nFor the Boss Blind itself, I'm estimating my current setup can handle the 600-chip requirement. With Popcorn Joker providing +12 multiplier and Onyx Agate scaling with my Club cards, a Two Pair with Clubs should generate enough chips to pass.\n\nCrafty Joker's +80 chip bonus only applies to Flushes, which I haven't been building toward. The Arcana Pack is tempting for potential Tarot effects, but I already have The Devil for economic generation. I'll skip both upgrades and move forward into the next round.\n\nDuring the Boss Blind, I can activate The Devil on a card to convert it to Gold, netting me $3 at round's end. Combined with interest and remaining hands, I should accumulate $7-10 total, giving me better economic flexibility than spending my $4 now on uncertain card effects.","action":"\"round_select\""}
