{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Current Blind: Small (5000 chips needed)\n- Money: $28\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n2. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n3. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI currently have 4 clubs in hand: King of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs.\n\nIf I can get one more club, I can play a Flush (5 clubs):\n- Base Flush (Level 2): 50 chips, 6 mult\n- Stuntman: +250 chips\n- Superposition: +50 chips\n- Total base chips: 50 + 250 + 50 = 350 chips\n- Plus the 5 club cards' values: King (10) + Queen (10) + 10 (10) + 2 (2) + one more club (varies)\n- Let's say conservatively another 2 for minimum: 350 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 384 chips\n\nFor multiplier:\n\n\n- Base Flush mult: 6\n- 5 clubs scored with Onyx Agate: 5 × 7 = 35 mult\n- Total mult: 6 + 35 = 41 mult\n\nThis gives me 384 × 41 = 15,744 chips, which easily clears the 5000 blind. With 9 clubs left in the 43-card deck, I have reasonable odds of hitting the fifth club. I'll discard the two hearts to maximize my chances.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2]"}
