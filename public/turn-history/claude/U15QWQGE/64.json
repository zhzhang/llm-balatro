{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2: Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n3: Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4: 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n5: Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n6: 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Need 7,500 chips total\n- 4 hands remaining, 1 discard remaining\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have TWO PAIR: a pair of Queens (Queen of Clubs and Queen of Diamonds) AND a pair of Jacks (Jack of Spades and Jack of Clubs)\n- I have 3 Clubs (Queen of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 7 of Clubs)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card (first hand only)\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size (can only play 3 cards max)\n5. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n\n**Key Constraint:** Stuntman limits me to playing only 3 cards at a time.\n\n**Possible Plays:**\n\n**Option 1: Play Two Pair (but I can only play 3 cards)**\nWith Stuntman, I can only play 3 cards. If I play both Queens and one Jack, that would be:\n- 2 Queens + 1 Jack = This would only count as a PAIR (the Queens), not Two Pair\n- The Jack wouldn't participate in the pair, so it wouldn't add chips\n\n\n- Playing Queen of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, and Jack of Clubs gives me 10 base chips for the pair, plus 10 from each Queen, plus 250 from Stuntman. The Onyx Agate adds 7 Mult for the Queen of Clubs since it's a Club, bringing my multiplier to 2 base plus that bonus.\n\nWait, I need to check if the Jack of Clubs triggers Onyx Agate. The rules state that cards not participating in the hand don't activate their own effects or trigger other effects, so the Jack doesn't count even though it's a Club. My multiplier is just 2 + 7 = 9, giving me 280 × 9 = 2,520 chips total.\n\nFor the Jack pair option, I'd play Jack of Spades, Jack of Clubs, and 7 of Clubs. The base pair chips are 10, each Jack contributes 10, and the 7 doesn't participate. Stuntman adds another 250 chips to the score.\n\nWith the pair, both Jacks participate, so Onyx Agate triggers for the Club Jack. That gives me a multiplier of 2 + 7 = 9 again, resulting in the same 2,520 chips.\n\nFor the third option, I could play three Clubs as a High Card—Queen, Jack, and 7 of Clubs. Only the Queen participates as the highest card, contributing 10 chips. The Jack and 7 don't participate, so they don't add chips. Stuntman provides 250 additional chips, though the base High Card value is just 5.\n\nWith only the Queen scoring, Onyx Agate gives +7 for that single Club, making my multiplier 1 + 7 = 8. This yields 265 × 8 = 2,120 chips—noticeably weaker than the pair options.\n\nI'm aiming for roughly 2,500 chips per hand across four hands to exceed 7,500. The pair plays consistently deliver around 2,520, which would work. I notice I could theoretically form a Two Pair with all my cards, but Stuntman's three-card limit prevents that. My strongest plays appear to be the pair combinations.\n\nPlaying Queen of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, and Jack of Clubs should net me the 2,520 chips I calculated. However, I still have one discard remaining. Since there are additional Queens, Jacks, and 7s in the deck, discarding strategically might let me draw into a Three of a Kind instead. Three of a Kind at Level 3 scores 70 base chips plus 30 from the three cards themselves.\n\nWith Stuntman adding 250 and a multiplier of 40 (from the base 7, Zany Joker's +12, and Onyx Agate's +21 if all three are Clubs), I'd reach 14,000 chips—an instant win. The problem is the odds: only about 11% chance of hitting the third card I need from the remaining deck.\n\nI could also pursue a third 7 instead, since there are two more in play. For my discard strategy, I need to keep the Queen of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, and 7 of Clubs to maximize my chances. Discarding the Jack of Spades, Queen of Diamonds, and 4 of Diamonds leaves me positioned to draw three fresh cards that could complete either the Queen or Jack pair into a three-of-a-kind. Diamonds.\n\nThis leaves me with three opportunities to complete a set. But reconsidering the strategy, playing now with a pair seems safer than discarding—I'd get 2,520 chips from the pair, and across four hands that should be enough to hit 7,500. I'll play Queen of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, and Jack of Clubs, using the pair for scoring while the Jack sits unused.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,5]"}
