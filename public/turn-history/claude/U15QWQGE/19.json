{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $4\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +12 Mult (decreases by 4 each round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Devil: Can enhance 1 card into Gold Card\n- Tags:\n  1. Investment Tag: Gain $25 after defeating Boss Blind\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- Current Blind: Big Blind\n  - Chips needed: 1200\n  - Reward: $4\n  - Tag for skipping: Foil Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n- Upcoming Blind: Boss\n  - Chips needed: 1600\n  - Boss effect: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n  - Reward: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need to decide whether to play the Big Blind or skip it for the Foil Tag.\n\n**Foil Tag benefits:**\n- Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil\n- Foil edition gives x1.5 Mult when the joker scores\n- This could save me money on a joker purchase and give it a permanent multiplier boost\n\n**If I skip:**\n- I keep my $4\n- I get the Foil Tag\n- I go straight to Boss Blind (1600 chips needed)\n- After Boss: $4 + $5 (Boss reward) + $25 (Investment Tag) = $34\n- Plus a free Foil joker from the shop\n\n**If I play:**\n- I need to beat 1200 chips\n- I get $4 reward\n- Then I face Boss Blind (1600 chips)\n- After Boss: $4 + $4 (Big reward) + $5 (Boss reward) + $25 (Investment Tag) = $38\n\n\n- No Foil Tag benefit\n\nMy past hands show I can comfortably exceed 1200 chips—my Two Pair alone scored 1,566. For the Boss Blind, the Diamond debuff is manageable since my Onyx Agate focuses on Clubs, which won't be affected.\n\nWeighing my options: skipping the Big Blind nets me around $34 plus a free Foil joker (roughly $8-10 value), but I'd face the Boss without a practice round. Playing it gives me $38 total and a chance to warm up before the harder challenge.\n\nThe Foil Tag's permanent x1.5 Mult boost combined with the free joker makes it worth $10-15 overall—more than the $4 I'd sacrifice. Since my past runs show I can consistently hit 1,566+ chips on Two Pair and well over 3,000 on Straights, I'm confident I can meet the 1600 threshold even without the extra round to test my hand combinations.\n\nBut I need to clarify how Popcorn works. It loses 4 Mult per \"round played\"—does that mean only when I actively play a round, or whenever a round passes? If skipping doesn't count as playing, then Popcorn stays at +12 Mult for the Boss instead of dropping to +8. That's a significant difference in my scoring potential.\n\nAssuming skipping preserves the Mult, I'd have enough power to handle the 1600-chip Boss threshold. The Foil Tag's long-term value—getting a free Foil joker—seems more valuable than the immediate $4 payout, so I'll skip the Big Blind.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
