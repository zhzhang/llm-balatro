{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6 (in shop phase)\n- Money: $34\n- Just bought Stuntman joker\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into a Gold Card\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Oops! All 6s - Doubles all listed probabilities - $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n2. Jumbo Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Planet Merchant - Planet cards appear 2X more in shop - $10\n\nReroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm entering Ante 4, which will have much higher chip requirements. I now have:\n- Stuntman providing +250 chips but -2 hand size (so I'll have 6 cards instead of 8)\n- Onyx Agate for +7 mult per Club\n- Superposition for +50 chips\n- Sixth Sense for potential Spectral card generation\n\nWith $34 remaining, I have several options:\n\n1. **Oops! All 6s** ($4) - Not immediately useful since I don't have probability-based effects\n2. **Standard Pack** ($4) - Could help me find more Clubs or other useful cards\n3. **Jumbo Arcana Pack** ($6) - Could give me Tarot cards for enhancements or modifications\n\n\n4. **Planet Merchant** ($10) - Would help me level up hands through planet cards\n5. **Reroll** ($5) - Could find better jokers or planet cards\n6. **Round Select** - Save money and move on\n\nI need to consider what matters most: my hand composition and what I can reliably trigger, whether I'm better off scaling further or pushing for immediate power, and what chip thresholds Ante 4 will demand. My Flush is Level 2 with decent stats, and Three of a Kind is Level 3, so I have some foundation to build on.\n\nSince Stuntman already provides substantial chip scaling, I'm looking for ways to multiply that value. The Jumbo Arcana Pack stands out because tarot effects like The Hanged Man or The Devil can fundamentally reshape my deck—adding Gold cards or destruction effects that synergize with my Clubs focus. Standard Pack is cheaper but more limited, while Planet Merchant requires too much investment right now. I'll go with the Jumbo Arcana Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
