{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (just completed Big Blind, now in shop before Boss Blind)\n- Money: $37\n- Next up: Boss Blind (Ante 3)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Popcorn - +4 Mult (will be 0 next round, essentially worthless)\n2. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n3. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n4. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n- Max Jokers: 5 (1 slot available)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhance card to Gold Card ($3 per round when held)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (1 slot available)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Justice (Tarot) - $3 - Enhance to Glass Card (X2 Mult, 1 in 4 chance to destroy)\n2. Standard Pack - $4\n3. Overstock Voucher - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n- Current Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Recent Actions:**\n- I just got a Polychrome Ace of Diamonds from the Aura spectral card (X1.5 Mult)\n- I bought Sixth Sense for free earlier\n- I bought a Spectral Pack for $4\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need to prepare for the Boss Blind. Let me think about what I should do:\n\n1. **Sell Popcorn** - It's at +4 Mult now and will be 0 next round, making it useless. I can get $2 for it and free up a joker slot.\n\n2. **Buy Justice** - For $3, I can enhance a card to Glass Card (X2 Mult, 1 in 4 chance to destroy). \n\nThis could be powerful if applied to a high-value card. I should consider which card would benefit most from the X2 Mult multiplier, especially since I have the Polychrome Ace of Diamonds that could synergize well.\n\n3. **Reroll Shop** - For $5, I might find better jokers or other useful items.\n\n4. **Buy Standard Pack** - For $4, I can add a playing card to my deck, but this doesn't seem as valuable right now.\n\n5. **Buy Overstock** - For $10, I get +1 card slot in shop. This is good for long-term value but might not help immediately with the Boss Blind.\n\nGiven that I'm about to face a Boss Blind and Popcorn is worthless next round, I should prioritize selling it and using those funds strategically. Justice could enhance a key card for the upcoming challenge, making it worth the $3 investment.\n\nSelling Popcorn for $2 frees up a joker slot and gives me more flexibility. With that extra space, I could hunt for a stronger joker through a shop reroll, or invest in Justice to boost my Ace's multiplier. My current jokers—Polychrome Ace, Sixth Sense, Superposition, and Onyx Agate—all have solid synergies, but finding something that scales better against the Boss Blind might be worth the $5 reroll cost.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
