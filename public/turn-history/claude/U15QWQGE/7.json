{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (Big Blind)\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Money: $1\n- Chips Needed: 450\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**Owned Jokers:**\n1. Popcorn: +20 Mult, -4 Mult per round played (this is Round 2, so it's now +16 Mult)\n2. Onyx Agate: Played cards with Club suit give +7 Mult when scored\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n6. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n7. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n8. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- I have 2 Clubs (9, 8)\n- I have 3 Hearts (K, Q, 7)\n- I have 2 Spades (J, 6)\n- I have 1 Diamond (A)\n\nLet me look for the best hand to play:\n\n1. **Straight?** I need 5 consecutive ranks. Let me check:\n   - Ace (can be high or low)\n   - King, Queen, Jack... need a 10. I don't have a 10.\n   - Or: 9, 8, 7, 6... need a 5. I don't have a 5.\n   - No straight possible.\n\n2. **Flush?** I'd need 5 cards of the same suit. \n\nI can't form a flush since my highest suit count is 3 Hearts. No pairs exist either, so I'm limited to High Card.\n\nFor High Card, I should play the 5 highest-value cards: Ace of Diamonds (+11), King of Hearts (+10), Queen of Hearts (+10), Jack of Spades (+10), and 9 of Clubs (+9). The 9 of Clubs is particularly valuable since it triggers the Onyx Agate's +7 Mult bonus.\n\nThis gives me 50 chips from card values plus 5 base chips for High Card. With Popcorn Mult at 16 (down from 20 after Round 2) and the Onyx Agate bonus, my total multiplier reaches 24, yielding 55 × 24 = 1,320 chips—well above the 450 needed. I should verify if adjusting my card selection to include more Clubs could improve this further.\n\nPlaying the Ace, King, Queen, 9 of Clubs, and 8 of Clubs instead gives me 48 chips from cards plus 5 base, totaling 53. With the same Popcorn multiplier of 16 and now two Clubs triggering Onyx Agate for +14 mult, my total multiplier becomes 31. This scores 53 × 31 = 1,643 chips—even stronger. Since I can already exceed the required score with just a High Card hand, there's no need to strategically discard and rebuild; I should play immediately and secure the win.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [8,3,4,6,7]"}
