{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Phase: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $34\n- Must decide whether to play Big Blind or skip for Orbital Tag\n\n**Big Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 7,500\n- Reward: $4\n- No special restriction\n\n**Skip Option:**\n- Orbital Tag: Upgrade [poker hand] by 3 levels\n- Would advance directly to Boss Blind\n\n**Boss Blind (upcoming):**\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Boss Description: Must play 5 cards\n- Reward: $5\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size (so I can only play 3 cards normally)\n5. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind\n\n**Key Issue with Boss Blind:**\nThe Boss Blind requires playing 5 cards, but Stuntman reduces my hand size by 2, meaning I can normally only play 3 cards maximum. This is a MAJOR problem - I literally cannot satisfy the Boss Blind's requirement with my current build!\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Three of a Kind - 6,342 chips (against 5,000 requirement)\n- High Card - 2,520 chips (against 5,000 requirement)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me think about what happens if I play the Big Blind:\n- I need 7,500 chips\n- My last Three of a Kind earned 6,342 chips against a 5,000 threshold\n- With Zany Joker now added, I'd get +12 more Mult on Three of a Kind\n\n\n- That should easily push me over 7,500\n\nBut then I'd face the Boss Blind which requires playing 5 cards, and I can only play 3 cards due to Stuntman. This is impossible to beat!\n\nWhat if I skip the Big Blind?\n- I get Orbital Tag (upgrade a poker hand by 3 levels)\n- I could use it on Three of a Kind (already level 3, would go to level 6)\n- Or I could use it on another hand type\n- But I'd still face the Boss Blind immediately with the same 5-card requirement problem\n\n**The Core Problem:**\nStuntman gives me +250 chips which is valuable, but the -2 hand size penalty creates an insurmountable obstacle for the Boss Blind. Either path forward—playing Big Blind or skipping it—leads to the same impossible situation where I can't meet the 5-card requirement.\n\nI need to either sell Stuntman before facing the Boss, find a way to expand my hand size, or accept that I'll need to deal with this incompatibility eventually. Since I'm already halfway through at Ante 4/8 with $34, and the Boss is unavoidable regardless of my next move, I should play the Big Blind now while I still have a viable strategy.\n\nIf I skip instead, I'd get the Orbital Tag to upgrade Three of a Kind significantly, but I'd immediately hit the Boss Blind selection screen with no option to skip—meaning I'd still have to play with the same Stuntman problem. Playing now lets me earn the $4 reward and reach the shop where I can remove Stuntman before the Boss becomes mandatory.\n\nLet me calculate what Three of a Kind actually scores. With my three Aces and the Stuntman card, I'm looking at around 370 base chips from the hand and Stuntman, plus roughly 83 chips from the individual Aces themselves, totaling about 453 chips before multipliers. The multiplier comes from the base hand value plus Zany Joker's boost, which should get me close to the 7,500 threshold.\n\nActually, let me recalculate the multiplier more carefully. I have the base 7 from Three of a Kind, Zany Joker adds 12, and Onyx Agate adds 7 for the Club suit, giving me 26 total multiplier. That means 453 × 26 = 11,778 chips—well above what I need.\n\nSince I can comfortably beat the Big Blind, I should play it. The $4 plus interest is valuable, and afterward I can shop to sell Stuntman before facing the Boss. Skipping this round won't solve my real problem anyway: the Boss needs 5 cards but I can only play 3, so I need to find a way to increase my hand size regardless.","action":"\"play_round\""}
