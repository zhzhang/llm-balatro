{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $4\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +12 Mult (decreases by 4 each round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Devil: Can enhance 1 card into Gold Card ($3 when held at end of round)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Mail-In Rebate: Earn $5 for each discarded Ace - Cost: $4\n  2. Gift Card: Add $1 of sell value to every Joker and Consumable - Cost: $6\n- Boosters: None (already bought)\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Reroll Surplus: Rerolls cost $2 less - Cost: $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels (after upgrades):**\n- Flush: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 6\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 50, Base Mult 5\n- Other hands at Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $4 left. My options are:\n1. Buy Mail-In Rebate for $4 (would leave me with $0)\n2. Save money and go to round select\n3. Reroll shop for $5 (but I only have $4, so this is not possible)\n\nMail-In Rebate costs $4 and gives me $5 per discarded Ace. The issue is that I don't know how many Aces are currently in my deck. Looking at the description, it says \"rank changes every round\" - so it's specifically targeting Aces this round, but will change to a different rank next round.\n\n\nThe real question is whether discarding Aces makes sense strategically. Since I've already invested heavily in Celestial Packs and I'm facing tougher chip requirements in Ante 2, I need to consider if sacrificing high-value cards is worth the immediate cash return. Mail-In Rebate only applies this round before the rank shifts, so it's a one-time opportunity rather than a sustainable income source.\n\nComparing my options: Gift Card is out of reach at $6, so it's between Mail-In Rebate and banking the $4 for future flexibility. Given my current setup with strong jokers and leveled poker hands, I'm better off preserving capital for upcoming shops where I might find more impactful upgrades or need to reroll for better options.","action":"\"round_select\""}
