{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (in shop before Boss Blind)\n- Money: $28\n- Next: Boss Blind of Ante 3\n\n**Current Jokers (3/5 slots):**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n\n**Current Consumables (1/2 slots):**\n1. The Devil - Enhance card to Gold Card ($3 per round when held)\n\n**Shop Offerings After Second Reroll:**\n1. Misprint (Joker) - $4 - \"+.\" (description seems incomplete, but typically gives random +Mult)\n2. Supernova (Joker) - $5 - Adds the number of times poker hand has been played this run to Mult\n3. Standard Pack - $4\n4. Overstock Voucher - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n- Next Reroll Cost: $7\n\n**Analysis of New Shop Options:**\n\n1. **Misprint - $4**\n   - Typically gives random +0 to +23 Mult each hand\n   - Inconsistent but can be powerful\n   - At Common rarity, it's a decent value for $4\n\n2. **Supernova - $5**\n   - Adds the number of times a poker hand has been played to Mult\n   - Looking at my hand levels:\n     - High Card: 4 times played = +4 Mult\n     - Two Pair: 2 times played = +2 Mult\n     - Pair: 1 time played = +1 Mult\n     - Three of a Kind: 1 time played = +1 Mult\n     - Straight: 1 time played = +1 Mult\n     - Full House: 1 time played = +1 Mult\n   - This is weak now but scales over time as I play more hands\n   - For a Boss Blind fight immediately ahead, this isn't great\n\n3. **Standard Pack - $4**\n   - Adds cards to deck, not immediately useful\n\n4. **Overstock - $10**\n   - Would leave me with only $18, which is risky before a Boss Blind\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n- I need jokers that will help me beat the Boss Blind\n- I have 2 empty slots to fill\n\nSupernova won't provide immediate value since it only accumulates mult based on hand plays—right now that's just +10 total across all hands. Misprint offers more immediate potential with its random mult boost, though it's unpredictable. The Standard Pack doesn't help me prepare for the upcoming challenge. Overstock would drain too much cash before facing the Boss Blind, leaving me vulnerable if I need to pivot strategy. I have decent jokers already—my Polychrome Ace, Onyx Agate, and Superposition should generate solid scores. My Three of a Kind hand hit 2,295 chips recently, which puts me in range for the Boss Blind's typical 2,000-3,000 chip requirement. I've already spent $11 on rerolls, so I need to decide if filling my remaining joker slots is worth the cost or if I should just proceed with what I have.\n\nMisprint offers immediate value with an average of +11-12 Mult for $4, while Supernova's current +1-4 Mult is underwhelming despite its long-term scaling potential. The choice between them is clear—Misprint gives me better immediate returns. But honestly, I'm better off skipping both and pushing forward to the Boss Blind. My current setup should be sufficient, and preserving my remaining chips makes more sense than investing further.","action":"\"round_select\""}
