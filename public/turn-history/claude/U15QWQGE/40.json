{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (in shop before Boss Blind)\n- Money: $39\n- Next: Boss Blind of Ante 3\n\n**Current Jokers (3/5 slots):**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n\n**Current Consumables (1/2 slots):**\n1. The Devil - Enhance card to Gold Card ($3 per round when held)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Justice (Tarot) - $3 - Enhance to Glass Card (X2 Mult, 1 in 4 chance to destroy)\n2. Standard Pack - $4\n3. Overstock Voucher - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Recent Changes:**\n- Just sold Popcorn for $2 (was +4 Mult, would be 0 next round)\n- Have a Polychrome Ace of Diamonds (X1.5 Mult) from Aura spectral card\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n1. I'm about to face a Boss Blind which will have special challenging effects\n2. I have 2 open joker slots (3/5 used)\n3. I have $39 to spend\n4. My strongest hand is Three of a Kind (Level 3, 70 chips, 7 mult)\n5. I have a Polychrome Ace that gives X1.5 Mult when played\n\n**Options:**\n\n1. **Buy Justice ($3)** - Enhance a card to Glass Card (X2 Mult, 1 in 4 chance to destroy)\n   - The X2 Mult multiplies with my existing multipliers, especially the Polychrome Ace\n   - The destruction risk is manageable if I apply it strategically to a high-value card\n   - Works well with my current multiplicative scaling approach\n\n2. **Buy Standard Pack ($4)** - Add a playing card to deck\n   - Provides deck flexibility but doesn't immediately strengthen my hand for the Boss Blind\n\n3. **Buy Overstock ($10)** - +1 card slot in shop\n   - Valuable for future rounds but uses significant capital now\n   - Would leave me with $29 remaining for other purchases\n\n4. **Reroll Shop ($5)** - Hunt for better jokers\n   - I have 2 empty joker slots to fill\n   - A reroll could surface more powerful options to tackle the Boss Blind\n   - Spending $5 leaves me $34 to work with afterward\n   - The current shop lacks jokers entirely, making this a reasonable gamble\n\n5. **Round Select** - Proceed to Boss Blind\n   - I could advance now, but with $39 available, I should maximize my preparation\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nRerolling the shop makes the most sense. I have two joker slots open and enough capital to spend $5 on a reroll while maintaining $34 for subsequent purchases. Since the shop currently shows no jokers—only Justice, Standard Pack, and Overstock—a reroll gives me a better chance at finding jokers that can meaningfully boost my damage output for the Boss Blind.\n\nEven if the reroll disappoints, I can fall back on Justice or other items. But with two empty slots and jokers providing permanent bonuses, it's worth checking what else is available before committing to what's here.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
