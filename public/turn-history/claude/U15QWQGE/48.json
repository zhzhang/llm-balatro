{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Boss Blind: All Spade cards are debuffed\n- Chips needed: 4,000\n- Current chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (debuffed - scores no chips and all abilities disabled)\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n4. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n\nI have 5 clubs! This is a FLUSH! Let me calculate:\n\n**Flush with 5 clubs (Ace, 10, 9, 4, 3):**\n\nBase chips from Flush (Level 2): 50\nCards scored:\n- Ace of Clubs: +11\n- 10 of Clubs: +10\n- 9 of Clubs: +9\n- 4 of Clubs: +4\n- 3 of Clubs: +3\nTotal base chips: 50 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 3 = 87\n\nSuperposition (Foil): +50 chips\nTotal chips before mult: 87 + 50 = 137\n\nBase mult from Flush (Level 2): 6\nOnyx Agate: +7 mult per club scored = +7 × 5 = +35 mult\n\n\nTotal mult: 6 + 35 = 41\n\nFinal score: 137 × 41 = 5,617 chips—well above the 4,000 needed. Playing the five clubs as a flush will secure the win. The scoring order confirms the Boss Blind won't affect clubs, and the Jokers will activate properly during the hand. No held-in-hand abilities apply. Superposition with Foil edition contributes an additional 50 chips as an independent Joker effect, with no other base Joker effects active. This gives a total chip count of 137 (50 base + 11 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 3 + 50 from Superposition) multiplied by 41 mult (6 base + 35 from Onyx Agate), resulting in 5,617 chips—enough to clear the blind in a single hand. The scoring sequence places the Ace, 10, 9, 4, and 3 of Clubs in positions 3 through 7.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,7]"}
