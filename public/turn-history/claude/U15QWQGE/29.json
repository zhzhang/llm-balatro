{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4 (SHOP phase)\n- Money: $30\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers (3/5):\n  1. Popcorn: +8 Mult (degrading, -4 per round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: +7 Mult for Club cards\n  3. Superposition (Foil): Creates Tarot when Ace + Straight, +50 chips\n- Consumables (1/2):\n  1. The Devil: Enhances 1 card to Gold Card\n  \n**Shop Options:**\n1. Jupiter (Planet) - $3: Level up Flush to Level 3 (+2 Mult, +15 chips)\n2. Standard Pack - $4: Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards\n3. Overstock Voucher - $10: +1 card slot in shop\n4. Reroll - $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - Just leveled, never played\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) - Never played\n- Straight: Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult) - Played once for 3,321 chips\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - Played twice\n- Full House: Level 1 (40 chips, 4 mult) - Played once\n- High Card: Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult) - Played 4 times\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nI just used Venus to level up Three of a Kind to Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult). This is now a strong hand type that I should try to utilize.\n\nWith my current jokers:\n\n\n- Popcorn: +8 Mult\n- Onyx Agate: +7 Mult for Club cards\n- Superposition: +50 chips\n\nA Three of a Kind with clubs would give approximately:\n- Base: 70 chips, 7 mult\n- Cards: +10 chips per card (3 cards = 30 chips if they're face cards or high value)\n- Superposition: +50 chips\n- Total chips: ~150 chips\n- Popcorn: +8 mult\n- Onyx Agate: +7 mult per club (3 clubs = +21 mult)\n- Total mult: ~36 mult\n\n, resulting in 150 × 36 = 5,400 chips\n\nThat's quite strong! Round 4 of Ante 3 is coming up—likely a Boss blind requiring 2,000-2,500 chips. Popcorn will continue degrading, so I need to consider my options carefully. Jupiter for $3 would level Flush to 3, but I'm uncertain about playing it regularly. A Standard Pack for $4 might provide better cards for my deck, though I should evaluate what I actually need before committing.\n\nRerolling for $5 could surface better jokers or planets, but I have $30 saved and Three of a Kind is now Level 3 with solid scoring potential. The Devil gives me flexibility to enhance a card to Gold if needed. I think proceeding to round select makes the most sense—I don't see any essential purchases here, and I'd rather preserve my money for higher-value joker upgrades in future shops.\n\nJupiter at $3 is tempting for Flush flexibility, but I haven't leaned into that hand type at all, so it doesn't feel like a priority right now. Moving forward to test how Three of a Kind performs seems like the better play.","action":"\"round_select\""}
