{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Blind: Small (5000 chips needed)\n- Money: $28\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n2. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n3. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n6. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card\n2. Mars - Levels up Four of a Kind\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Two 10s (Hearts and Clubs) - could make a pair\n- King of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, 10 of Clubs - three clubs\n- 8 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds - two diamonds\n\nPossible hands:\n1. **Pair of 10s** (10 Hearts + 10 Clubs)\n   - Base: 10 chips, 2 mult (Level 1)\n   - Stuntman: +250 chips = 260 chips\n   - Cards in pair: 10 Hearts (+10) + 10 Clubs (+10) = 20 chips\n   - Total chips: 260 + 20 = 280 chips\n   - Since the 10 of Clubs scores, Onyx Agate triggers for +7 mult, bringing total multiplier to 9\n   - Final score: 280 × 9 = 2,520 chips\n\n2. **High Card** with multiple clubs\n   - Base: 5 chips, 1 mult (Level 1)\n   - Stuntman: +250 chips = 255 chips\n   - Playing all 3 clubs means only the King counts as the highest card\n   - King of Clubs: +10 chips\n   - Total: 255 + 10 = 265 chips, 1 mult = 265 chips\n\nBut reconsidering a pair of 10s—both would be scored in the hand. The 10 of Hearts contributes +10 chips without any multiplier bonus, while the 10 of Clubs adds +10 chips and triggers Onyx Agate's +7 mult. The pair itself generates the base chips before Stuntman's bonus applies.\n\nCalculating the full score: base pair chips of 10, plus Stuntman's +250, plus both 10s' chip values totaling +20, gives 280 chips. For multiplier, the pair provides 2 base mult, and Onyx Agate from the club adds 7, resulting in 9 total mult. This yields 280 × 9 = 2,520 chips—still well below the 5,000 target. I should discard and redraw, keeping the three clubs for their Onyx Agate synergy while dropping the Hearts 10, 8 of Diamonds, and 3 of Diamonds.\n\nNow reconsidering: if I could assemble a Three of a Kind using clubs, the base hand would score 70 chips with 7 mult at Level 3. Adding Stuntman's +250 and the three cards' chip values gives roughly 350 chips. With three clubs triggering Onyx Agate, I'd gain 21 mult on top of the base 7, reaching 28 total mult—a much stronger position for hitting the 5,000 threshold.\n\nA Flush with clubs would be even more powerful. The base hand contributes 50 chips and 6 mult, but Stuntman and Superposition together add 300 chips, plus the five cards themselves contribute around 50 more. That's 400 chips total. Five clubs would grant 35 mult from Onyx Agate, pushing the multiplier to 41. The result: 400 × 41 = 16,400 chips—far exceeding what I need. Since I already have three clubs in hand, I should focus on discarding the others and drawing toward either of these club-heavy combinations.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,5,6]"}
