{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (just completed Boss Blind from Ante 1)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $12\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +12 Mult (decreases by 4 each round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Devil: Can enhance 1 card into Gold Card ($3 when held at end of round)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Mail-In Rebate: Earn $5 for each discarded Ace (rank changes every round) - Cost: $4\n  2. Gift Card: Add $1 of sell value to every Joker and Consumable card at end of round - Cost: $6\n- Boosters:\n  1. Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - Cost: $4\n  2. Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - Cost: $4\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Reroll Surplus: Rerolls cost $2 less - Cost: $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm now in Ante 2, which means the blinds will be harder. Looking at my hand history:\n- I've been playing Straight, Two Pair, Full House primarily\n- My Straight just scored 3,321 chips in the Boss Blind\n- Popcorn is now at +12 Mult and will continue to decrease\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Popcorn is diminishing - it will be at +8 Mult after the next round, +4 after that, and then 0. This is a limited resource.\n2. I haven't used The Devil yet to create a Gold Card\n\n\n3. With $12 available, I need to evaluate what provides the most value.\n\nMail-In Rebate doesn't align with my strategy since I'm relying on Aces for hand composition. Gift Card would generate $3 per round across my current items, but that's a slow payoff. The Celestial Packs could improve my scoring through Planet cards, while Reroll Surplus at $10 is expensive but would reduce future reroll costs to $3 each.\n\nAs I move into Ante 2 with tougher chip targets, my Popcorn joker's effectiveness is fading. I need either stronger jokers, upgraded hand types, or a solid money-generating system. Leveling up Straights through Celestial Packs seems promising since I just played that hand successfully.\n\nWith $12 available, I'm weighing whether to grab both Celestial Packs ($8 total) to boost multiple hands I'm using, or explore other combinations. Investing in hand upgrades directly strengthens my scoring, especially since leveling Straight would boost both its chip and multiplier values. I'm leaning toward purchasing both packs to maximize my hand type improvements going forward. The Devil requires me to be in an active round with cards to use it, so I can't activate it during the shop phase. I'll hold off on that for now and focus on the immediate value of buying both packs—leveling up versatile hands like Straight twice, or spreading upgrades across different hand types. This leaves me with $4 for future shop opportunities.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
