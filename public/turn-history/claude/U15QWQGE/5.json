{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $1\n- Owned Jokers: Popcorn (+20 Mult, -4 Mult per round), Onyx Agate (Club cards +7 Mult when scored)\n- No consumables\n- Just finished buying the Buffoon Pack and selected Onyx Agate\n\n**Shop Offers:**\n1. The Hanged Man (Tarot) - $3 - Destroys up to 2 selected cards\n2. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately\n3. Overstock Voucher - $10 - +1 card slot available in shop\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 450 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, $5 reward, debuffs all Heart cards\n\n**My Current Scoring Power:**\nWith Popcorn (+20 Mult) and Onyx Agate (+7 Mult per Club card scored), let me calculate a typical hand:\n\nIf I play a Full House with 3 Clubs and 2 other cards:\n- Base chips: 40\n- Card chips: Let's say ~41 (from the cards themselves)\n- Total chips: 81\n- Base mult: 4\n- Popcorn mult: +20\n- Onyx Agate mult: +21 (3 Clubs × 7)\n- Total mult: 4 + 20 + 21 = 45\n- Score: 81 × 45 = 3,645 chips\n\nThat's MASSIVELY more than I need for either the Big Blind (450) or Boss Blind (600).\n\n**What can I afford with $1?**\n\n\nNothing available costs less than $3, so I can't purchase anything right now. Since I'm already far exceeding the chip requirements for both blinds, I should move forward to the round select screen, beat the Big Blind to earn $4 plus interest, and then return to shopping with more funds.\n\nThe correct action is: round_select","action":"\"round_select\""}
