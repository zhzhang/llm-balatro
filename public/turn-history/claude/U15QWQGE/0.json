{"reasoning":"I need to analyze this blind select phase and decide whether to play the small blind or skip it for the Foil Tag.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Ante 1/8, Round 0 (very beginning of the game)\n- I have $4\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Small blind requires 300 chips, rewards $3\n- If I skip, I get a Foil Tag (makes next base edition shop joker free and Foil)\n- Big blind requires 450 chips, rewards $4\n- Boss blind requires 600 chips, rewards $5, debuffs all Heart cards\n\nAt the start of the game, I should consider:\n1. Can I beat the small blind with no jokers? Probably yes, with standard poker hands\n2. Is the Foil Tag worth skipping $3 and not getting shop access?\n3. What's my strategy for this run?\n\nThe Foil Tag gives a free joker with Foil edition (+4 chips). This could be valuable, but:\n- I'd miss out on $3 reward\n- I'd miss the chance to shop after the small blind\n- I'd go straight to the big blind which is harder (450 vs 300)\n\nOn the other hand, playing the small blind:\n- I get $3 reward\n- I can shop after (with $4 + $3 + interest = ~$7-8)\n- I can buy jokers/consumables to help with future blinds\n- The small blind is easy to beat\n\nIn early game, it's generally better to play blinds rather than skip for tags, because:\n1. You need the money to build up your economy\n2. You need shop access to get jokers and items\n3. Tags are more valuable later when you have a stronger build\n\nThe small blind with 300 chips is very beatable with basic hands. Even just playing pairs or two pairs should easily get there.\n\nDecision: I should play the small blind to get the reward money and shop access.","action":"\"play_round\""}
