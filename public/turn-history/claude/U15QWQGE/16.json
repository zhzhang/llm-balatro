{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state and the three planet card options:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3 (still in shop phase after Ante 1)\n- Money: $4\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +12 Mult (will decrease by 4 each round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\n- Consumable: The Devil (can enhance 1 card into Gold Card)\n\n**Planet Pack Options:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card (+1 Mult and +10 chips): Would upgrade from 5 chips/1 mult to 15 chips/2 mult\n2. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult and +20 chips): Would upgrade from 30 chips/3 mult to 50 chips/5 mult\n3. Jupiter - Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips): Would upgrade from 50 chips/6 mult (Level 2) to 65 chips/8 mult (Level 3)\n\n**Hand Performance History:**\n- Straight: 3,321 chips (Boss Blind)\n- Two Pair: 1,566 chips\n- High Card: 336 chips\n- Full House: 324 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Pluto (High Card)**: High Card is a fallback hand that I've only played once. Upgrading it from 5/1 to 15/2 is a significant relative improvement, but High Card isn't part of my core strategy. This is the weakest option.\n\n2. **Venus (Three of a Kind)**: Three of a Kind is a solid hand that I haven't played yet. Upgrading from 30/3 to 50/5 is a substantial boost. Three of a Kind is easier to form than a Flush and more consistent than relying on Straight patterns. \n\nThree of a Kind could round out my hand selection nicely and give me another reliable option when Straights don't appear.\n\n3. **Jupiter (Flush Level 3)**: Upgrading Flush to Level 3 would give it 65 chips/8 mult. With my Onyx Agate joker providing +7 Mult per Club card, a Club flush would scale exceptionally well. But this means concentrating my strategy around one hand type rather than building flexibility.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nMy Popcorn joker is fading fast—it's at +12 now and will drop to +8 next round, then +4, then gone. I need to develop hands that don't rely on it for late-game performance.\n\n**Comparing Options:**\n\nJupiter (Flush to Level 3) synergizes powerfully with Onyx Agate, especially for Club-heavy flushes. A 5-card Club flush would score around 6,325 chips when accounting for base chips, card contributions, and the combined multiplier from Onyx Agate and Popcorn. The downside is that Flush requires all five cards to match suits, making it unreliable to trigger consistently.\n\nVenus (Three of a Kind) offers more consistency since it's easier to assemble than Flush. It would provide solid base chips with three matching cards, giving me a dependable fallback when better hands don't materialize.\n\nLooking at my recent plays, I've landed Straight, Two Pair, and Full House successfully, but haven't yet capitalized on the Flush upgrade I just made. Since I've already invested in Flush and it pairs well with my current Onyx Agate setup, committing to Jupiter and pushing Flush to Level 3 seems like the stronger play—the payoff would be substantial if I can assemble Club flushes.\n\nBut Venus offers a more dependable path forward. Three of a Kind is easier to trigger than Flush and would give me another solid hand to lean on when the cards don't align for my primary strategies. Given that I've already proven I can win with diverse hand types, adding this extra layer of consistency might be smarter than betting everything on one upgraded hand.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
