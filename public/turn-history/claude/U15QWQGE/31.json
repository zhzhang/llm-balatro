{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $30\n- Tags: Uncommon Tag (free Uncommon Joker in shop)\n\n**Current Blind Options:**\n1. Big Blind: 3000 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip reward: Handy Tag ($1 per played hand this run = $8)\n2. Boss Blind: 4000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss effect: All Spade cards are debuffed\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Popcorn: +8 Mult (degrading, -4 per round)\n2. Onyx Agate: +7 Mult for Club cards\n3. Superposition (Foil): Creates Tarot when Ace + Straight, +50 chips\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - Never played but just upgraded\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n- Straight: Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult)\n- Full House: Level 1 (40 chips, 4 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nShould I play or skip the Big Blind?\n\nIf I skip:\n- I get a Handy Tag worth $8 (from past played hands)\n- I lose the $4 reward for beating the blind\n- I go straight to the Boss Blind\n\nIf I play:\n- I need to score 3000 chips\n- I earn $4 + interest\n- I get to test my setup before the Boss\n\n**Score Estimation:**\n\nLet me estimate Three of a Kind with Clubs:\n- Base: 70 chips, 7 mult\n\n\n- Three club cards contribute 30 chips, and Onyx Agate multiplies that by +21 mult (7 per card × 3 cards). Combined with Popcorn's +8 mult, my total multiplier reaches 36. That gives me roughly 3,600 chips—enough to comfortably beat the 3000 chip threshold.\n\nThe Boss Blind's Spade debuff actually works in my favor since I'm leaning into Clubs anyway. I have $30 available and an Uncommon Tag waiting after this round, so resources aren't constrained. Popcorn will degrade to +4 mult next round, and playing the Big Blind nets me $4 versus $8 from skipping—a minor difference that doesn't justify avoiding practice with my current setup.\n\nI'm going to play this. Testing my Three of a Kind strategy now gives me confidence before facing the Boss, and I can comfortably hit 3000 chips with what I have. The warm-up is worth more than the $4 difference.","action":"\"play_round\""}
