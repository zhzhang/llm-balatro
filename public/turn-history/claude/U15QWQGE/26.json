{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state and context:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4\n- Money: $34\n- In SHOP phase\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +8 Mult (decreased from +12, has -4 per round played)\n  2. Onyx Agate: +7 Mult for Club cards\n- Max Jokers: 5 (can add 3 more)\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Devil (enhances 1 card to Gold Card)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (can add 1 more)\n\n**Shop:**\n- Cards:\n  1. Superposition (Common Joker, Foil edition) - FREE! (Foil Tag applied)\n     - Creates a Tarot card when playing Ace + Straight\n     - +50 chips\n  2. Jupiter (Planet) - $3\n     - Level up Flush to Level 3\n- Boosters:\n  1. Celestial Pack - $4 (choose 1 of 3 Planet cards)\n  2. Standard Pack - $4 (choose 1 of 3 Playing cards)\n- Vouchers:\n  1. Overstock - $10 (+1 card slot in shop)\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush: Level 2 (Base Chips 50, Base Mult 6) - played 0 times but leveled\n- Most other hands at Level 1\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my previous plays:\n- I've been relying on Flush (Level 2), Two Pair, and High Card\n- Popcorn is degrading (-4 mult per round), now at +8\n- Onyx Agate gives +7 mult for Clubs\n\n\n- The free Superposition with Foil bonus is a strong pickup since it generates Tarot cards when I play Ace + Straight combinations, giving me deck manipulation tools. Jupiter at $3 would push Flush to Level 3, though I haven't actually played it yet despite it being Level 2, so the value depends on whether I'll use it more going forward.\n\nThe Celestial Pack offers more flexibility by letting me choose which hand type to level, making it potentially better than committing to Jupiter alone. I have The Devil consumable available to convert a card to Gold for extra money generation if needed. With $34 available and needing to preserve resources for later antes as chip requirements climb, I should prioritize the free Superposition joker and evaluate whether the additional hand leveling is worth the investment right now.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
