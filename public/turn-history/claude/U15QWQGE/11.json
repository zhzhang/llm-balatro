{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT (I need to decide whether to play this Boss Blind)\n- Money: $4\n- Boss Blind: Requires 600 chips, all Heart cards are debuffed\n- Reward for winning: $5\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers:\n  1. Popcorn: +16 Mult (will become +12 Mult after this round due to -4 per round played)\n  2. Onyx Agate: Club cards give +7 Mult when scored\n- Consumables:\n  1. The Devil: Can enhance 1 card into Gold Card (Gold cards give $3 when held at end of round)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis is a Boss Blind that debuffs all Heart cards. Since Heart cards will be debuffed, they won't contribute their chip values or trigger any effects when played. However, according to the rules, debuffed cards WILL still participate in forming hand types.\n\nLet me estimate if I can beat this blind:\n\nLooking at my previous hands:\n- I've been playing Two Pair, Full House, and High Card\n- My last Two Pair scored 1,566 chips, which is way more than the 600 needed\n- My Full House scored 324 chips (this was in Round 1 when Popcorn had +20 Mult)\n\nWith my current setup:\n- Popcorn will give +16 Mult (but after playing a hand in Round 3, it will be +12 Mult)\n- Wait, I need to check this more carefully. The description says \"+16 Mult -4 Mult per round played\"\n- Looking at the history, Round 2 was just completed, and Popcorn shows +16 Mult\n- This means in Round 3 (the upcoming Boss round), Popcorn will be at +12 Mult\n\n\n- If I play a Two Pair without Hearts, I'd get base 20 chips plus card values. With face cards and a Club, that's roughly 54 chips before multipliers. With Popcorn at +12 Mult and Onyx Agate boosting Clubs, I should easily exceed 600 chips.\n\nSince Boss Blinds can't be skipped per the rules, I have no choice but to play. The only viable action is play_round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
