{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- In the SHOP phase\n- Money: $5\n- Just bought Popcorn joker (+20 Mult, -4 Mult per round played)\n\n**Shop Offers:**\n1. The Hanged Man (Tarot) - $3 - Destroys up to 2 selected cards\n2. Buffoon Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n3. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards (use immediately)\n4. Overstock Voucher - $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 450 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, debuffs all Heart cards\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- 1 Joker: Popcorn (+20 Mult, -4 Mult per round)\n- Full House scored 324 chips last time\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith Popcorn (+20 Mult), let me recalculate what my Full House would score:\n- Base chips: 40\n- Card chips from the hand I played: 9+9+9+7+7 = 41\n- Total chips: 81\n- Base mult: 4\n- Popcorn mult: +20\n- Total mult: 24\n- Score: 81 × 24 = 1,944 chips\n\nThat's WAY more than enough for the Big Blind (450) and even the Boss Blind (600)!\n\nWith $5, I can:\n1. Buy The Hanged Man for $3, leaving me with $2\n2. Buy Buffoon Pack for $4, leaving me with $1\n3. Buy Celestial Pack for $4, leaving me with $1\n4. Reroll for $5, leaving me with $0\n\n\n5. Save money and proceed to the next blind\n\nThe Hanged Man offers deck thinning but isn't urgent. Buffoon Pack gives me a choice between two jokers, which is solid value. Celestial Pack could level up Full House since it's my main hand, though the description cuts off. Since I'm already scoring well above what I need, I should consider whether an immediate upgrade justifies spending my remaining cash.\n\nRerolling costs everything and might not yield better options. Saving lets me earn more money from the next blind and shop again with a larger budget. Popcorn's +20 Mult is strong, though it decays by 4 each round—meaning I have roughly 5 rounds before it becomes negligible. That's plenty of time to progress without needing upgrades right now.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack appeals to me since choosing between 2 jokers adds flexibility and scaling for just $4. The Celestial Pack would strengthen Full House or diversify my hand types against the Boss's Heart debuff. But if I beat the Big Blind first, I'll earn $4 plus $1 interest on my $5, giving me $10 to spend—enough for both packs or better options.\n\nBuying Buffoon Pack now leaves me with only $5 after the Big Blind, whereas waiting gets me $10. Since I'm already equipped to handle the Big Blind and Boss with Popcorn, the extra joker's scaling potential might outweigh the financial advantage of saving. Though leveling Full House through Celestial Pack would also boost my chip and mult output significantly.\n\nThe key difference is that jokers provide continuous effects across the entire run, while hand upgrades are one-time boosts. Plus, having two joker options to choose from increases my odds of finding something synergistic. I'll go with Buffoon Pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
