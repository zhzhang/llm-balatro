{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Just completed Small Blind (earned $38 total)\n- In SHOP phase\n\n**Current Money:** $38\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n(Max Jokers: 5, so I have room for 1 more)\n\n**Current Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into Gold Card\n2. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips\n(Max Consumables: 2, so inventory is full)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains Three of a Kind - $4\n- The World (Tarot): Converts up to 3 cards to Spades - $3\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Jumbo Standard Pack: $6\n- Planet Merchant Voucher: $10\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent hand performance:\n- Just played Three of a Kind twice (6,342 chips and 2,295 chips previously)\n- Three of a Kind is already at Level 3\n- I have Mars to level up Four of a Kind\n\nThe Zany Joker would be excellent for my build since:\n1. I've been playing Three of a Kind successfully\n2. It adds +12 Mult which synergizes well with my current setup\n3. It costs only $4 and I have $38\n4. I have room for one more joker\n\nHowever, let me think about other options:\n\n\nThe World could help convert cards to Spades, but I'm building around Clubs for Onyx Agate's multiplier. Standard packs would add cards, though I'm not in desperate need. The Planet Merchant voucher is too expensive at $10 without a planet-focused strategy backing it.\n\nMy core approach centers on leveraging Clubs for Onyx Agate's boost, playing Three of a Kind when it comes up, and using Stuntman for chip generation. Adding Zany Joker would amplify the Three of a Kind strategy significantly—with it active, I'd get the base hand value plus the additional +12 Mult whenever that hand appears.\n\nSince I've already played Three of a Kind twice and it's performing well, investing $4 in Zany Joker to strengthen an established strategy makes more sense than pivoting to level up Four of a Kind with Mars. I'll buy Zany Joker.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
