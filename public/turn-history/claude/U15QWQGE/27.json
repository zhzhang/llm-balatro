{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 4 (Shop phase)\n- Money: $34\n- Just picked up Superposition (Foil) for free\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Jokers (3/5):\n  1. Popcorn: +8 Mult (degrading, -4 per round)\n  2. Onyx Agate: +7 Mult for Club cards\n  3. Superposition (Foil): Creates Tarot when Ace + Straight, +50 chips\n- Consumables (1/2):\n  1. The Devil: Enhances 1 card to Gold Card\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Jupiter (Planet) - $3: Level up Flush to Level 3 (+2 Mult, +15 chips)\n2. Celestial Pack - $4: Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards\n3. Standard Pack - $4: Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards\n4. Overstock Voucher - $10: +1 card slot in shop\n5. Reroll - $5\n\n**Hand Level Analysis:**\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult) - Never played yet!\n- Straight: Level 1 (30 chips, 4 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) - Played 2 times\n- High Card: Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult) - Played 4 times\n- Three of a Kind: Level 2 (50 chips, 5 mult) - Never played\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\n- Mostly High Card, Two Pair, and one big Straight\n- Recent Boss: Two Pair (966 chips) and several High Cards\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n\nSuperposition opens up a new strategy around Straights with Aces, which could generate valuable Tarot cards. The hand leveling data shows Flush and Three of a Kind are untapped despite being Level 2, while Straight has only been played once but generated strong results. Jupiter is an efficient upgrade at $3 to push Flush to Level 3, though I need to actually start playing it to benefit.\n\nCelestial Pack offers more immediate synergy—leveling Straight directly supports my Superposition strategy and aligns with hands I'm already playing. With $34 and escalating chip demands in Ante 3, I should prioritize upgrades that leverage existing momentum rather than speculative ones. Popcorn's diminishing returns mean I'll need to phase it out soon, making efficient spending critical right now.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
