{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Boss Blind: All Spade cards are debuffed\n- Chips needed: 4,000\n- Current chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (debuffed)\n2. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n4. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have 4 clubs (Ace, 9, 4, 3), which is great for Onyx Agate. I also have high cards like Queen, King, and Ace.\n\nLet me check for possible hands:\n\n1. **Straight potential**: I have Ace, King, Queen, 8, 7. For a straight, I'd need consecutive cards. Possible straights:\n   - A-2-3-4-5: I have A, 3, 4 but missing 2 and 5\n   - 10-J-Q-K-A: I have Q, K, A but missing 10 and J\n   - Other straights with 7, 8: I'd need 5-6-7-8-9 or 6-7-8-9-10, etc.\n\n2. **Flush potential**: I have 4 clubs. \n\nDrawing another club would complete a flush. My best immediate option is playing the Ace of Clubs as a high card, which gives me 16 base chips plus 50 from Superposition for 66 total, multiplied by 8 from Onyx Agate (one club scored).\n\nThat yields only 528 chips—far short of the 1,000 per hand I need to reach 4,000 total. I should discard the 7 of Spades since it's debuffed and use my remaining discards to hunt for a stronger combination. With five clubs still in the deck and four hands left to play, pursuing a flush seems like my best path forward.\n\nIf I can assemble five clubs, I'd score around 5,330 chips—a flush at Level 2 gives 50 base chips, roughly 30 from the clubs themselves, plus 50 from Superposition, multiplied by 41 (6 base mult plus 35 from Onyx Agate). A straight triggering Superposition to generate a Tarot card is another promising option. My immediate priority is discarding the debuffed card and drawing toward either of these hands.\n\nI'm working with limited resources—only 2 discards remaining across 4 hands left to play. The 7 of Spades is an obvious discard. Beyond that, I could remove the Queen and 8 of Hearts to push harder for the flush, though I need to calculate whether three discards gives me reasonable odds of hitting another club before my hands run out.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1]"}
