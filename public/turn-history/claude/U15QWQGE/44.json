{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Boss Blind: All Spade cards are debuffed\n- Chips needed: 4,000\n- Current chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 4\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Spades (debuffed)\n2. 4 of Spades (debuffed)\n3. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n5. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n6. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n7. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n8. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe spades are debuffed, so they won't contribute chips or trigger effects, BUT they can still form hand types.\n\nLooking at possible hands:\n- Pair of 9s (9♠ + 9♣): The 9♠ is debuffed so won't add chips, but the 9♣ will. Base pair is 10 chips + 2 mult.\n- Pair of 4s (4♠ + 4♣): Same issue - 4♠ debuffed but can form the pair.\n- Three hearts flush (Jack, 5, 2): Would be a flush but need 5 cards of same suit\n- Three clubs (9, 4, 3): Need 5 for a flush\n\nSince I need 4,000 chips and have only 4 hands to work with, I need to think strategically. My best hand is Three of a Kind (Level 3: 70 chips, 7 mult) which scored 2,295 chips last time.\n\n\nI don't have three of a kind available right now—just two pairs. Two pair only scores 20 chips with 2 mult, which won't get me close to 4,000. Since the spades are useless except for forming hand types, I should discard them and hunt for better cards. The clubs are valuable because Onyx Agate multiplies them by 7, so keeping those makes sense.\n\nLooking at my scoring potential: a pair of 9s with the club would give me (10 + 9 + 50) × (2 + 7) = 621 chips, while a pair of 4s would only reach 576 chips. Both fall far short of my target. I need to find a way to build something much stronger.\n\nMy best path forward is pursuing three of a kind at this level, which means I should prioritize keeping my clubs (9♣, 4♣, 3♣) to work with Onyx Agate's multiplier boost. The spades are actively hurting my score, so I'll discard those along with some hearts to cycle toward better cards. I'm ditching the 9♠, 4♠, and Jack to make room.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
