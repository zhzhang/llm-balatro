{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Current Blind: Small (5000 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 2520 (need 2480 more)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Money: $28\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips, +50 chips from foil edition)\n6. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - single 6 creates Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have three Aces (Spades, Clubs, Diamonds). This is a Three of a Kind!\n\nLet me calculate the score for playing Three of a Kind with the three Aces:\n\n**Three of a Kind (Level 3):**\n- Base: 70 chips, 7 mult\n- Stuntman: +250 chips\n- Superposition: +50 chips (foil edition bonus)\n- Total base chips: 70 + 250 + 50 = 370 chips\n\n**Cards in the hand:**\n- Ace of Spades: +11 chips\n- Ace of Clubs: +11 chips\n- Ace of Diamonds (foil): +11 chips + 50 chips (from foil edition) = +61 chips\n\n\n- Combined card value: 83 chips\n\n**Multiplier calculation:**\n- Base mult from Three of a Kind: 7\n- Ace of Clubs triggers Onyx Agate: +7 mult\n- Total multiplier: 14\n\n**Final score:** 453 chips × 14 = 6,342 chips, bringing my total to 8,862 chips—well above the 5,000 threshold. I'll play positions 1 and 4. + 61 = 453 chips with a 14x multiplier (7 base plus 7 from Onyx Agate). That gives 453 × 14 = 6,342 chips. Combined with the existing 2,520, I reach 8,862 total—well above the 5,000 threshold. Playing the three Aces in positions 1, 4, and 5 is the move.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,5]"}
