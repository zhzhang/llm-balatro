{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6 (in SHOP phase)\n- Money: $28\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 4)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 2)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Onyx Agate - +7 Mult per Club scored\n2. Superposition (Foil) - +50 chips + creates Tarot with Ace+Straight\n3. Sixth Sense - If first hand is single 6, destroy it and create Spectral card\n4. Stuntman - +250 Chips, -2 hand size\n\n**Consumables:**\n1. The Devil - Enhances 1 card into a Gold Card\n2. Mars - Levels up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n\n**Shop:**\n- Cards: Oops! All 6s ($4)\n- Boosters: Standard Pack ($4)\n- Vouchers: Planet Merchant ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Three of a Kind: Level 3 (70 chips, 7 mult) - strongest leveled hand\n- Flush: Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1 (60 chips, 7 mult)\n- All others Level 1\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI'm about to enter Ante 4, which will have significantly higher chip requirements. Looking at my recent performance:\n- Flush: 5,617 chips (Ante 3 Boss)\n- Pair: 1,156 chips\n- Three of a Kind: 2,295 chips\n\nMy current setup:\n- Stuntman provides +250 chips\n- Onyx Agate provides +7 mult per Club scored\n- Superposition provides +50 chips\n\n\n- I have a Mars planet card that levels up Four of a Kind\n\n**Options:**\n\nI could use Mars to boost Four of a Kind from Level 1 to Level 2, increasing it from 60 chips/7 mult to 90 chips/10 mult. The Devil could enhance a card to Gold for economy, but that doesn't directly improve scoring. Alternatively, I could purchase Oops! All 6s to work with Sixth Sense, or invest in Planet Merchant for better hand leveling going forward.\n\nI'm at full consumable capacity, so using Mars would free up space while strengthening a hand type I haven't yet leveraged effectively.\n\nThe Devil could generate economy through a Gold Card, but that's less impactful than improving my scoring directly. Since Ante 4 demands stronger performance, I should prioritize the Standard Pack to build Clubs synergy with Onyx Agate—that's been my most reliable scaling engine. Using Mars first makes sense to open up a consumable slot, then I can reassess whether additional boosters are worth the investment. On second thought, I should just move forward to the next round. My Stuntman and Onyx Agate combination is solid, and I have two consumables I can deploy strategically as needed.\n\nThe shop doesn't offer much value anyway—Oops! All 6s doesn't fit my build, the Standard Pack is nice but not essential, and Planet Merchant is too expensive when I already have a planet. Better to save my $28 and collect interest, keeping The Devil and Mars as tactical options for the upcoming round.","action":"\"round_select\""}
