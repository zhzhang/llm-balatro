{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $14\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Just beat the Big Blind (450 chips needed)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Photograph Joker - $5 - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored (Common)\n2. Saturn Planet - $3 - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips\n3. Buffoon Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n4. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately\n5. Director's Cut Voucher - $10 - Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante, $10 per roll\n6. Reroll shop - $5\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Played 2 Flushes (308 and 336 chips)\n- Played 1 Pair (44 chips)\n- Total: 688 chips against 450 needed\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm in Ante 1/8, just beat the Big Blind. Next up will be the Boss Blind of Ante 1. \n\nLooking at my play history, I've been playing Flushes very successfully (2 out of 3 hands). This suggests:\n1. I should consider leveling up Flush with a planet card\n2. I should look for jokers that synergize with Flush\n\nCurrent options:\n1. **Photograph Joker ($5)** - This gives X2 Mult on the first face card scored. This is multiplicative mult, which is powerful. If I play a flush with a face card, this would double the multiplier once. However, it only works once per hand.\n\n2. **Saturn Planet ($3)** - Levels up Straight. I haven't played any straights yet, so this doesn't synergize with my current strategy.\n\n\n3. **Buffoon Pack ($4)** - A joker pack could provide strong value, though there's some uncertainty in what I'll get. **Celestial Pack ($4)** - Choosing a planet card directly is appealing, especially if I can snag Neptune to boost Flushes. **Director's Cut ($10)** - Too expensive right now and beyond my budget.\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n\nWith $14, I could combine purchases like Photograph ($5) + Saturn ($3) + Buffoon Pack ($4) for $12 total, leaving $2 unspent. The key question is whether the Buffoon Pack's joker potential outweighs the guaranteed planet boost from Celestial.\n\nSince Flushes have been my reliable strategy, getting Neptune through Celestial Pack would directly strengthen that approach. The Buffoon Pack offers more upside but with less certainty. Photograph alone feels underwhelming—just X2 mult on a single card per hand doesn't move the needle much.\n\nI'm leaning toward Celestial Pack first to secure a planet that synergizes with my current gameplan, then reassess what else I can afford with the remaining budget.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
