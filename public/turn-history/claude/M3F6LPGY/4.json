{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (450 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 308 (need 142 more)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $8\n- No jokers, no consumables\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 4 of Spades - +4 chips\n2. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips\n3. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n4. 6 of Hearts - +6 chips\n5. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips\n6. Ace of Diamonds - +11 chips\n7. King of Diamonds - +10 chips\n8. 8 of Diamonds - +8 chips\n\n**Possible hands I can make:**\n\n1. **Pair of 6s** (positions 4, 5): 6 of Hearts + 6 of Clubs\n   - Base chips: 10\n   - Cards in hand: 6 + 6 = 12 chips\n   - Total chips: 10 + 12 = 22 chips\n   - Base mult: 2\n   - Total: 22 chips × 2 mult = 44 chips\n\n2. **Flush (Hearts)** (positions 2, 3, 4): Queen, 7, 6 of Hearts (only 3 cards)\n   - Need 5 cards for a flush, so this doesn't work\n\n3. **Flush (Diamonds)** (positions 6, 7, 8): Ace, King, 8 of Diamonds (only 3 cards)\n   - Need 5 cards for a flush, so this doesn't work\n\n4. **High Card** with Ace: 5 base chips + 11 = 16 chips × 1 mult = 16 chips\n   - Two pair isn't possible since I only have one pair available. I need roughly 47 chips per hand across my remaining 3 hands to hit the 450 chip blind. The pair of 6s gets me to 44 chips, which is close. I should consider whether discarding might yield better cards—there are still 2 more 6s in the deck, plus additional Queens and Aces available. safe. I should play the pair of 6s now to lock in 44 chips, leaving me needing roughly 49 per hand over the final 2 hands—a realistic target with pairs or better hands.\n\nAlternatively, I could discard the non-heart cards and chase a heart flush. With 3 hearts currently and 9 remaining in the deck, discarding 5 cards gives me a decent shot at drawing 2 more hearts for a flush.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5]"}
