{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 0\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $8 (doubled from the Economy Tag we just got)\n- No jokers, no consumables, no tags, no vouchers\n\n**Current Decision:**\nBig Blind:\n- Chips Needed: 450\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Foil Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n\nBoss Blind (upcoming):\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Boss Description: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nShould we skip the Big Blind for the Foil Tag?\n\nIf we skip:\n- We get Foil Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n- We keep our $8\n- We don't get the $4 reward\n- We move directly to Boss Blind\n- We miss the shop after Big Blind\n\nIf we play:\n- We need to beat 450 chips\n- We get $4 reward → $12 total\n- We get to shop after beating it\n- Then we can prepare for Boss Blind\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n1. **Can we beat 450 chips with no jokers?**\n   - A simple pair gives: 10 base chips + 2×10 (two cards) = 30 chips × 2 mult = 60 chips\n   - A two pair gives: 20 base chips + 4×10 (four cards) = 60 chips × 2 mult = 120 chips\n   - A three of a kind gives: 30 base chips + 3×10 = 60 chips × 3 mult = 180 chips\n   - A full house gives: 40 base chips + 5×10 = 90 chips × 4 mult = 360 chips\n   - A flush yields 35 base chips + 5×10 = 85 chips × 4 mult = 340 chips, while four of a kind reaches 60 base chips + 4×10 = 100 chips × 7 mult = 700 chips. Playing multiple hands should get us past 450 chips.\n\n2. **Value of Foil Tag:**\n   - Foil edition adds +50 chips when scored, and a free Foil joker from the next shop could be strong, but we'd skip the shop opportunity after Big Blind.\n\n3. **Boss Blind Hearts Debuff:**\n   - All Hearts are debuffed, making roughly a quarter of our deck unusable for the boss. We need jokers before facing it.\n\n4. **Money Analysis:**\n   - Skipping gives us $8, then $8 + $5 = $13 with one shop visit. Playing Big Blind nets $8 + $4 = $12, then after beating the Boss we'd have $12 + $5 = $17 (minus purchases) with two shop opportunities.\n\nThe core tension is that Hearts are debuffed at the Boss, so we really need jokers in hand before that fight. Skipping Big Blind means losing a shop chance and facing the Boss with a quarter of our deck unusable and no jokers to compensate.\n\nPlaying Big Blind lets us shop with $12 to grab 1-2 jokers that'll significantly improve our odds against the Boss. Even though we miss the Foil Tag, having the extra shop opportunity and more money to prepare feels like the stronger play. I should play the Big Blind.","action":"\"play_round\""}
