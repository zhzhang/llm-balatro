{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $1\n- I have two Jokers:\n  1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n  2. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Saturn - $3 - Level up Straight (can't afford)\n2. Director's Cut Voucher - $10 - Reroll Boss Blind (can't afford)\n3. Reroll shop - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**My Strategy:**\n- I've been playing Flushes successfully\n- Flush is Level 2 with Base Chips 50 and Base Mult 6\n- I have Zany Joker for Three of a Kind (+12 Mult)\n- I have Photograph for face cards (X2 Mult on first face card)\n\n**What Can I Do?**\nWith only $1, I cannot:\n- Buy Saturn ($3)\n- Buy Director's Cut ($10)\n- Reroll shop ($5)\n\nMy only real options are:\n1. Sell a joker to get more money\n2. Proceed to the round (round_select)\n\n**Should I Sell a Joker?**\n\nLet me think about this. I have two jokers that don't synergize well together:\n- Zany Joker wants me to play Three of a Kind\n- Photograph wants me to play hands with face cards (works well with Flush)\n\nIf I sell Zany Joker, I get $2, giving me $3 total. This would let me buy Saturn, which levels up Straight. But I haven't been playing Straights - I've been playing Flushes. Saturn doesn't help my Flush strategy.\n\nIf I sell Photograph, I get $2, giving me $3 total. \n\nSelling either one only gets me to $3, which still doesn't unlock better options. Selling both jokers would give me $5 to reroll the shop, but that's a risky trade—I'd be giving up my scoring tools just for a chance at better jokers. The Boss Blind is coming next, and I need to evaluate whether my current Flush setup with these jokers is strong enough to handle it, or if I should take the risk of rerolling.\n\nA Flush with face cards using Photograph would score around 1,200 chips (100 base chips × 12 mult from the doubled face card), while Three of a Kind with Zany only reaches about 900 chips. Photograph's synergy with high-value cards makes it the better choice for my current hand composition.\n\nSelling Zany wouldn't actually help since it's not actively hurting my strategy—it just sits unused when I'm focused on Flushes. Even if I sold it for $2 to reach $3 total, the only affordable option would be Saturn to level Straights, which doesn't align with what I'm playing. Without a meaningful purchase available, keeping the joker makes more sense than selling it for nothing.\n\nI'll move forward to the Boss Blind.","action":"\"round_select\""}
