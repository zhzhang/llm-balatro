Can't mix Hearts and Diamonds.\n\n3. **Two Pair: Aces and Kings**\n   - Cards\n\n: Ace of Hearts (1), Ace of Diamonds (5), King of Hearts (2), King of Clubs (4)\n   - Base: 20 chips, 2 mult (Two Pair Level 1)\n   - Played cards: 11 + 11 + 10 + 10 = 42 chips\n   - Total chips: 20 + 42 = 62 chips\n   - Photograph triggers on first face card (King of Hearts): X2 mult\n   - Total mult: 2 * 2 = 4 mult\n   - **Total: 62 * 4 = 248 chips**\n\n4. **Two Pair: Aces and 4s**\n   - Cards: Ace of Hearts (1), Ace of Diamonds (5), 4 of Hearts (3), 4 of Diamonds (\n\n8)\n   - Base: 20 chips, 2 mult (Two Pair Level 1)\n   - Played cards: 11 + 11 + 4 + 4 = 30 chips\n   - Total chips: 20 + 30 = 50 chips\n   - Photograph doesn't trigger (no face cards)\n   - Total mult: 2\n   - **Total: 50 * 2 = 100 chips**\n\n5. **Two Pair: Kings and 4s**\n   - Cards: King of Hearts (2), King of Clubs (4), 4 of Hearts (3), 4 of Diamonds (8)\n   - Base: 20 chips, 2 mult (Two Pair Level 1)\n   - Played cards: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28 chips\n   - Total chips: 20 + 28 = 48 chips\n   - Photograph triggers on first King: X2 mult\n   - Total mult: 2 * 2 = 4 mult\n   - **Total: 48 * 4 = 192 chips**\n\nThe 4-card Diamond Flush yields 728 chips, my strongest option. Adding my current 30 chips gives 758 total—still 42 short of the 800 target. With 3 hands and 3 discards remaining, I should explore whether another discard could produce a stronger hand. The deck has 10 Hearts, 7 Diamonds, 9 Clubs, and some Spades left to work with.\n\nA 5-card Heart flush could be more promising. If I land an Ace, King, and three mid-value cards, I'd get around 107 chips with an 8x multiplier from the Flush, and the Photograph would double that to 16x when the King appears—totaling roughly 1,712 chips, which would comfortably exceed 800. The challenge is whether I can actually assemble that hand with my remaining actions.\n\nLet me verify the Diamond option: with Ace, 6, 5, and 4 of Diamonds, I'm looking at 26 chips from the cards themselves plus the 65 base, giving 91 chips at 8x multiplier for 728 chips. Adding my current 30 brings me to 758—still 42 short. From here I could either lock in that Diamond flush now and hunt for the remaining chips across my last two hands, or discard strategically to chase the stronger Heart combination.\n\nPlaying it safe with the Diamond flush seems smarter. Even a modest pair with a face card and Photograph would easily cover the 42-chip gap, and I've already got the flush locked in. The risk of trying to build something better with limited discards isn't worth it.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8]"}
