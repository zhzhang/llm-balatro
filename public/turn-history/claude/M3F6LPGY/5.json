{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (450 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 352 (need 98 more)\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $8\n- No jokers, no consumables\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 4 of Spades - +4 chips\n2. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips\n3. 7 of Hearts - +7 chips\n4. Ace of Diamonds - +11 chips\n5. King of Diamonds - +10 chips\n6. Queen of Diamonds - +10 chips\n7. 10 of Diamonds - +10 chips\n8. 8 of Diamonds - +8 chips\n\n**Analysis of possible hands:**\n\n1. **Pair of Queens** (positions 2, 6): Queen of Hearts + Queen of Diamonds\n   - Base chips: 10\n   - Cards in hand: 10 + 10 = 20 chips\n   - Total chips: 10 + 20 = 30 chips\n   - Base mult: 2\n   - Total: 30 chips × 2 mult = 60 chips\n\n2. **Flush (Diamonds)** (positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8): Ace, King, Queen, 10, 8 of Diamonds (5 cards!)\n   - Base chips for Flush: 35\n   - Cards in the flush: Ace (11) + King (10) + Queen (10) + 10 (10) + 8 (8) = 49 chips\n   - Total chips: 35 + 49 = 84 chips\n   - Base mult for Flush: 4\n   - Total: 84 chips × 4 mult = 336 chips\n   \nThe diamond flush yields 336 chips, which exceeds the 98-chip deficit needed to clear the blind. Playing positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 will bring my total to 688 chips, comfortably surpassing the 450-chip requirement.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
