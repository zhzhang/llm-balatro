{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully.\n\n## Current State:\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $0\n- Jokers: Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind), Photograph (X2 Mult for first face card)\n- Consumables: None\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 2/5)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 0/2)\n\n## Blind Options:\n1. **Small Blind**: 800 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Skip tag: Negative Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Negative)\n   \n2. **Big Blind**: 1200 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip tag: Voucher Tag (adds one Voucher to the next shop)\n   \n3. **Boss Blind**: 1600 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss Description: Cards played previously this Ante are debuffed\n\n## My Capabilities:\n- Flush is Level 3: Base Chips 65, Base Mult 8\n- I've been successfully playing Flushes and scored 1,044 chips on the last boss\n- My Photograph joker gives X2 mult for the first face card scored\n- Zany Joker gives +12 mult for Three of a Kind (not aligned with my flush strategy)\n\n## Analysis:\n\n### Small Blind (800 chips):\n- This is very achievable. In Ante 1, I scored 1,044 chips on a boss blind with Level 2 Flush\n- Now I have Level 3 Flush (65 chips, 8 mult base) which is even stronger\n- I should easily be able to beat 800 chips\n\n**Skip Option - Negative Tag:**\n- Negative edition jokers don't count toward the joker limit (they give +1 joker slot)\n\n\n- A free Negative joker would be valuable, but I'm currently broke and can't access the shop anyway\n- The tag only applies if a base edition joker appears in the shop\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n\nThe boss blind's effect—debuffing cards played in earlier rounds—poses a real problem for my flush strategy since any cards I use now won't be available at full strength later. Still, with a full 52-card deck, I should have enough fresh cards to work with when facing the boss.\n\nMy immediate priority is generating capital. The Small Blind is winnable with my Level 3 Flush and will net me $3 plus additional earnings from leftover hands. This gives me the resources I need to actually shop and pursue the Negative tag if it appears. While the tag is tempting, I can't benefit from it without money, so securing funds first makes more strategic sense than gambling on a future shop opportunity.","action":"\"play_round\""}
