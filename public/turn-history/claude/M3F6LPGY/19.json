{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $4\n- Jokers: Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind), Photograph (X2 Mult for first face card)\n- No consumables\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 2/5)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 0/2)\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Midas Mask (Joker) - All played face cards become Gold cards when scored. Also earns $3 if held in hand at end of round - $7 (I can't afford this)\n2. Vampire (Joker) - X0.1 Mult per scoring Enhanced card, removes enhancement. Currently X1 Mult. Polychrome edition (+1.5 Mult) - $12 (I can't afford this)\n3. Mega Standard Pack (Booster) - Choose 2 of up to 5 playing cards - $8 (I can't afford this)\n4. Arcana Pack (Booster) - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4 (I CAN afford this!)\n5. Clearance Sale (Voucher) - All cards and packs 25% off - $10 (I can't afford this)\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $6 (I can't afford another reroll)\n\n**Analysis of Recent Performance:**\n- I've been successfully playing Flushes, especially with face cards for the Photograph joker\n- My Flush hand is Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult base)\n- Last played hands were all flushes (1,044 chips, 336 chips, 308 chips)\n- The Photograph joker has been very effective when I have face cards in my flush\n\n\n- The Zany Joker remains unused since it needs Three of a Kind to activate\n\nThe Arcana Pack is my only viable purchase at $4. Tarot cards can enhance playing cards with various properties like Gold, Mult, or Wild, or modify existing jokers. Given the difficulty spike ahead, securing a boost now could be valuable.\n\nI could skip this shop and save for later, but investing in the Arcana Pack makes sense at this stage of Ante 2. I'll buy it.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
