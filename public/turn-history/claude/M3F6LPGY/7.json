{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (choosing from a Celestial Pack)\n- Current Money: $10\n- No jokers, no consumables yet\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Neptune - Levels up Straight Flush (+4 Mult and +40 chips)\n2. Jupiter - Levels up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips)\n3. Uranus - Levels up Two Pair (+1 Mult and +20 chips)\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Played 2 Flushes (308 and 336 chips) - this was my winning strategy\n- Played 1 Pair (44 chips)\n- Total: 688 chips against 450 needed\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- I've played Flush 2 times successfully (Times Played: 2)\n- Current Flush stats: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4\n- I haven't played Straight Flush (Times Played: 0)\n- I've played Pair once but not Two Pair\n\nThe obvious choice here is **Jupiter** because:\n1. I've successfully played Flush twice already\n2. It directly strengthens my proven winning strategy\n3. After using Jupiter, Flush would go to Level 2 with Base Chips 50 (35+15) and Base Mult 6 (4+2)\n\nNeptune levels up Straight Flush, which I haven't played yet. While Straight Flush is a powerful hand, it's much harder to make than a regular Flush (need 5 sequential cards of the same suit vs just 5 cards of the same suit).\n\nUranus levels up Two Pair, which I haven't played yet either. The upgrade is minimal (+1 Mult and +20 chips) compared to Jupiter.\n\n\nI'm going with Jupiter at position 2. Since Flush has been my most consistent scoring method, upgrading it makes the most sense. The boost takes it from Base Chips 35 and Base Mult 4 to Base Chips 50 and Base Mult 6, which should give me a solid advantage heading into the Boss Blind.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
