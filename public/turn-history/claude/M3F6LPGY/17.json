Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\\n6. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips) - FACE CARD\\n7. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\\n\\n**Jokers:**\\n1. Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\\n2. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\\n\\n**Goal:** 600 chips needed\\n**Remaining:** 4 plays, 3 discards\\n\\n**Possible Hands:**\\n1. **Pair of 6s** (6 of Spades + 6 of Diamonds)\\n   - Base: 10 chips, 2 mult\\n   - Cards contributing: 10 + 6 + 6 = 22 chips\\n   - Queen is a face card but won't be part of the pair, so Photograph triggers\\n   - Wait, no. Photograph says \\\"First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\\\"\\n   - If I play the pair of 6s with the Queen, the Queen won't score (won't add chips) because it's not part of the pair\\n   - But will Photograph still trigger? Let me re-read: \\\"First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\\\"\\n   - \\\"When scored\\\" suggests the face card needs to actually contribute to scoring\\n   - Since only cards that are part of the highest hand type contribute chips, the Queen wouldn't score\\n   - So Photograph likely wouldn't trigger\\n\\n2. **Diamond Flush** (4 Diamonds)\\n   - I have: Ace, Queen, 6, 4 of Diamonds\\n   - Need 5 cards for a flush, only have 4 diamonds\\n   - Can't make this\\n\\n3. **Club Flush** (3 Clubs)\\n   - I have: 8, 3, 2 of Clubs\\n   - Only 3 clubs, need 5\\n   - Can't make this\\n\\n4. **High Card with Queen**\\n   - If I play just the Queen: 5 + 10 = 15 chips, mult = 1\\n   - Photograph triggers: 15 chips \\u00d7 2 = 30 chips\\n   - Very weak\\n\\nI need to figure out my best strategy here. The pair of 6s seems promising if I can add more value, but I'm limited by what cards actually score in the hand.\\n\\nLooking at what's left in the deck\\u20149 diamonds, 12 spades, 10 clubs, and 10 hearts\\u2014I should focus on either building toward three of a kind to activate the Zany Joker, or getting more diamonds for a flush. The low cards like the 6s aren't strong enough on their own, so I'd want to keep the Queen and Ace as anchors while discarding weaker cards.\\n\\nLet me reconsider the pair of 6s combined with the Queen by playing positions 1, 6, and 7 together.\\n\\nThe pair of 6s forms the only scoring hand here, giving me 22 chips total with a 2x multiplier. The Queen doesn't contribute to the hand itself, so it wouldn't score\\u2014which means Photograph's bonus wouldn't trigger since the effect requires the face card to actually score as part of the hand.\\n\\nI need to find a better strategy. Keeping the Queen makes sense for future Photograph triggers, and the Ace has decent value. I'll discard most of the low cards to try drawing into something stronger like three of a kind or a flush. Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 seem like the best candidates to replace. That leaves me with Queen, Ace, and 4 of Diamonds in hand. With 4 plays and 3 discards remaining, I need to figure out how to reach 600 chips. The pair of 6s with Queen gives me at most 88 chips if Photograph triggers, which falls far short. I should discard the weak cards and rebuild around Queen and Ace instead.\\nCommand: discard 1 2 3 4 7\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 16]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

If I discard strategically and draw 2 more cards, I could potentially complete a diamond flush or find another scoring combination.\\n\\nWith 36 cards remaining in the deck, drawing another diamond gives me roughly a 22% chance per card. I'm weighing whether to pursue the flush with my Queen or pivot toward three of a kind. The diamond flush scenario with the Queen would give me a strong multiplier, so that seems like the most promising path forward.\\n\\nIf I discard two cards now, I'd have a 40% chance of drawing at least one diamond from the remaining deck. That's decent odds for trying to complete the flush, though not guaranteed. The risk is real, but the payoff\\u2014hitting around 960 chips with the Photograph multiplier\\u2014would comfortably exceed my 600-chip target.\\n\\nI could also play it safer by keeping some flexibility. With four hands left after this one, I could attempt the flush now, and if it doesn't work out, I'd still have one more discard to try again. If that fails too, I'd fall back on playing the strongest hand I can construct multiple times. The key is deciding which cards to discard\\u2014I'm leaning toward removing the 8 of Spades and 9 of Clubs to maximize my chances of drawing diamonds while preserving other options.\\nCommand: discard 1 2\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 17]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.

Playing the pair now would give me 120 chips, leaving me needing 480 more from just 3 remaining plays\\u2014that's a tough target. If I use my last discard strategically, I could potentially draw another diamond to complete a flush, which would multiply my score significantly more than a simple pair.\\n\\nA diamond flush with the Queen would score around 936 chips after the Photograph multiplier triggers, easily clearing my 600-chip goal. With 8 diamonds remaining in the deck, I have roughly a 24% chance of hitting it with my discard. The risk is that if I miss, I've wasted my only discard and may have discarded something valuable, leaving me in a worse position for my final plays.\\n\\nPlaying without the discard means relying on the pair of Queens across my remaining plays. I need to recalculate what that actually yields\\u2014the base pair gives 30 chips, but the Photograph multiplier only applies to the first face card scored, not both Queens, so my mult calculation was off.\\n\\nWith the pair of Queens scoring 120 chips per play and only 4 plays available, I'd reach 480 chips total\\u2014still 120 short of my goal. I have to attempt the diamond flush, which means discarding strategically. The 4 of Spades or one of the clubs makes sense to discard, but I should preserve the Queen of Clubs since it anchors my backup scoring plan.\\n\\nThe 4 of Spades is the weakest card here\\u2014it doesn't support any flush draw and has minimal value. I'll remove it and hope for a diamond to complete the flush.\\nCommand: discard 1\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Zany Joker.
