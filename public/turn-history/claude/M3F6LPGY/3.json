{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (450 chips needed)\n- Current Money: $8\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades - +10 chips\n2. Queen of Spades - +10 chips\n3. 10 of Spades - +10 chips\n4. 9 of Spades - +9 chips\n5. 3 of Spades - +3 chips\n6. 6 of Hearts - +6 chips\n7. Ace of Diamonds - +11 chips\n8. 8 of Diamonds - +8 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have 5 spades in my hand! That's a flush!\n- King of Spades (position 1)\n- Queen of Spades (position 2)\n- 10 of Spades (position 3)\n- 9 of Spades (position 4)\n- 3 of Spades (position 5)\n\nLet me calculate the flush:\n- Base chips for Flush: 35\n- Cards in the flush: King (10) + Queen (10) + 10 (10) + 9 (9) + 3 (3) = 42 chips\n- Total chips: 35 + 42 = 77 chips\n- Base mult for Flush: 4\n- Total: 77 chips × 4 mult = 308 chips\n\nThat's a good chunk! But I need 450 total, so I need 142 more chips across my remaining 3 hands.\n\nActually, let me check if I have a straight:\n- King, Queen, 10, 9... I'd need a Jack to complete this straight.\n\n\n- The remaining cards don't form a straight either.\n\nSo my best hand right now is the flush with 5 spades, which scores 308 chips. Playing it now would leave me needing about 47 chips per hand on average from my remaining 3 hands—achievable with pairs. Discarding further risks wasting my 3 remaining discards without guaranteeing better cards, so the flush seems like a solid play to lock in. I'm weighing whether to hold out for a straight or straight flush—I'd need a Jack to complete either, and there are only 4 Jacks left in the deck. The odds aren't favorable enough to justify discarding cards I already have.\n\nThe flush is strong enough. I'll lock in the 308 chips now and focus on maximizing the remaining 142 chips across my last three hands.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
