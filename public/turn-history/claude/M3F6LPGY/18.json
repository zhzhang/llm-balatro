{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $9\n- Jokers: Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind), Photograph (X2 Mult for first face card)\n- No consumables\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 2/5)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 0/2)\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Mars (Planet) - Level up Four of a Kind +3 Mult and +30 chips - $3\n2. To Do List (Joker) - Earn $4 if poker hand is a Straight Flush - $4\n3. Mega Standard Pack (Booster) - Choose 2 of up to 5 playing cards - $8\n4. Arcana Pack (Booster) - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n5. Clearance Sale (Voucher) - All cards and packs 25% off - $10\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $5\n\n**Analysis of Recent Performance:**\n- I've been successfully playing Flushes, especially Diamond Flushes with the Photograph joker\n- My Flush hand is Level 2 (50 chips, 6 mult base)\n- Last played hands were all flushes (1,044 chips, 336 chips, 308 chips)\n- The Photograph joker has been very effective when I have face cards in my flush\n- The Zany Joker hasn't been used yet (requires Three of a Kind)\n\n**What Should I Buy?**\n\n1. **Mars (Planet Card)** - $3\n   - Levels up Four of a Kind\n   - I haven't played any Four of a Kind hands yet\n   - Zany Joker works with Three of a Kind, not Four of a Kind\n   - Doesn't fit my current approach\n\n2. **To Do List (Joker)** - $4\n   - Requires Straight Flush plays to generate value\n   - I'm focused on regular Flushes right now, not Straight Flushes\n   - Skip for now\n\n3. **Mega Standard Pack** - $8\n   - Could strengthen my deck by adding cards that support flush-building\n   - Potentially useful for improving hand consistency\n   - Worth considering\n\n4. **Arcana Pack (Tarot Cards)** - $4\n   - Tarot cards might enhance my existing cards or jokers\n   - Could provide a boost to my current strategy\n\n5. **Clearance Sale (Voucher)** - $10\n   - I only have $9 available\n   - Can't afford this option\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n- Ante 2 means higher chip requirements ahead\n- My flush approach has been effective so far\n- I should prioritize either strengthening my flush capability with better suited cards, building toward Three of a Kind for the Zany Joker, or finding jokers that work better with my playstyle\n\n**Best**\n\nLooking at my options, I should spend $5 to reroll the shop since none of the current jokers really complement what I'm doing. A reroll might surface a planet card to boost my flush further, or better jokers that synergize with my strategy. That leaves me with $4 afterward, which gives me flexibility for future purchases while I'm still early in the run.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
