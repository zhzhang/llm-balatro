{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $0\n- Jokers: Zany Joker (+12 Mult for Three of a Kind), Photograph (X2 Mult for first face card)\n- Consumables: None (I just used Jupiter)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 2/5)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (I have 0/2)\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Midas Mask (Joker) - $7 (can't afford)\n2. Vampire (Joker) - $12 (can't afford)\n3. Mega Standard Pack (Booster) - $8 (can't afford)\n4. Clearance Sale (Voucher) - $10 (can't afford)\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $6 (can't afford)\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Flush is now Level 3: Base Chips 65, Base Mult 8 (upgraded from Level 2 using Jupiter)\n- All other hands are Level 1\n\n**What can I do?**\nWith $0, I have very limited options:\n1. Sell a joker for $2 (Zany Joker or Photograph)\n2. Move to round_select to progress to the next blind\n\n**Analysis:**\n- I can't buy anything in the shop with $0\n- I can't reroll with $0\n- Selling a joker would give me $2, but that's still not enough to buy anything useful in this shop\n  - The cheapest item is Midas Mask at $7\n  - Even with $2, I'd need $5 more\n- The Zany Joker hasn't been useful yet since I've been playing Flushes, not Three of a Kind\n- The Photograph has been helpful when playing face cards in my flushes\n\n\n- Since I'm stuck with no funds and selling wouldn't help me purchase anything, I need to move forward to the next blind to generate more money and continue building my deck.","action":"\"round_select\""}
