{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 1/8, Round: 1\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (450 chips needed)\n- Current Money: $8\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades - +10 chips\n2. 10 of Spades - +10 chips\n3. 9 of Spades - +9 chips\n4. 3 of Spades - +3 chips\n5. King of Hearts - +10 chips\n6. Ace of Clubs - +11 chips\n7. 3 of Clubs - +3 chips\n8. 5 of Diamonds - +5 chips\n\n**Possible hands I can make:**\n1. **Pair of Kings** (positions 1, 5): King of Spades + King of Hearts\n   - Base chips: 10\n   - Cards in hand: 10 + 10 = 20 chips\n   - Base mult: 2\n   - Total: 30 chips × 2 mult = 60 chips\n\n2. **Pair of 3s** (positions 4, 7): 3 of Spades + 3 of Clubs\n   - Base chips: 10\n   - Cards in hand: 3 + 3 = 6 chips\n   - Base mult: 2\n   - Total: 16 chips × 2 mult = 32 chips\n\n3. **Flush (Spades)** (positions 1, 2, 3, 4): King, 10, 9, 3 of Spades (4 cards)\n   - Need 5 cards for a flush, so this doesn't work\n\n\n4. **High Card** with the Ace yields only 16 chips.\n\nThe pair of Kings gives me 60 chips, but I need 450 total. With 4 hands remaining and 4 discards available, I should strategically discard weaker cards to build toward stronger combinations across multiple plays.\n\nLooking at what's left in the deck: most suits have 9-12 cards remaining, and by rank, I'm missing key duplicates—only 2 Kings left (both in my hand), 2 threes left (both in my hand), and 3 each of Aces, 10s, 9s, and 5s. Since I already hold the Kings and threes, my best path forward is targeting those remaining Aces, 10s, and 9s to form pairs or better hands across my remaining plays.\n\nI need to average roughly 112 chips per hand to hit 450 total. Discarding the 5 of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs, and possibly one 3 gives me a shot at drawing into stronger combinations. A flush in spades could yield around 340 chips with multipliers, while a straight might net 320 chips—both solid targets for the hands ahead.\n\nSince I already have 4 Spades, pursuing a fifth one makes sense. I'll remove the King of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, and 5 of Diamonds, keeping my four Spades and drawing four fresh cards in hopes of completing the flush.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8]"}
