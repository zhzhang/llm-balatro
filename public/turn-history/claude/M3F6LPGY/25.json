{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small (need 800 chips)\n- Current Chips: 30 (from the failed High Card play that only scored 30 chips)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $0\n\n**Jokers:**\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Three of a Kind\n- Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n2: King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3: Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n4: Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5: 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n6: King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7: Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8: 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at what hands I can make:\n\n1. **Two Pair: Aces and Kings**\n   - Cards: Ace of Hearts (1), Ace of Clubs (3), King of Hearts (2), King of Diamonds (6)\n   - Base: 20 chips, 2 mult (Two Pair Level 1)\n   - Played cards contributing: 11 + 11 + 10 + 10 = 42 chips\n   - Total chips: 20 + 42 = 62 chips\n   - Photograph triggers on first face card (King of Hearts): X2 mult\n   - Total mult: 2 * 2 = 4 mult\n   - Total: 62 * 4 = 248 chips\n\n2. **Pair of Aces:**\n   - Cards: Ace of Hearts (1), Ace of Clubs (3)\n   - Base: 10 chips, 2 mult (Pair Level 1)\n   - Played cards: 11 + 11 = 22 chips\n   - Total chips: 10 + 22 = 32 chips\n   - Photograph doesn't trigger (no face cards)\n   - Total mult: 2\n   - Total: 32 * 2 = 64 chips\n\n3. **Pair of Kings:**\n   - Cards: King of Hearts (2), King of Diamonds (6)\n   - Base: 10 chips, 2 mult (Pair Level 1)\n   - Played cards: 10 + 10 = 20 chips\n   - Total chips: 10 + 20 = 30 chips\n   - Photograph triggers on King of Hearts: X2 mult\n   - Total mult: 2 * 2 = 4 mult\n   - Total: 30 * 4 = 120 chips\n\n4. **Three Clubs:**\n   - Cards: Ace of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, 8 of Clubs\n   - Only 3 cards, can't form a flush without 5\n\n5. **Three Diamonds:**\n   - Cards: King of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds\n   - Only 3 cards, insufficient for a flush\n\n6. **Two Hearts:**\n   - Cards: Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts\n   - Only 2 cards, can't complete a flush\n\nThe strongest option available is the Two Pair (Aces and Kings), yielding approximately 248 chips. Combined with my current 30 chips, that's 278 total—still 522 chips short of 800. I have 3 remaining hands and 4 discards to work with. I need to focus on building toward higher-value hands or triggering better multipliers with my remaining plays.\n\nLooking at what's left in the deck: Hearts dominate with 11 cards, while Spades, Clubs, and Diamonds each have around 9-10. Since flush hands have been consistently profitable (Level 3 Flush generates 65 base chips with 8x multiplier), pursuing a flush seems like the strongest path forward. I should discard my current hand and aim to draw into Hearts, which has the highest remaining count. If I drop the three Diamonds, I'd keep my two Hearts and draw three new cards, giving me a solid chance at completing a flush. ades: 9 cards remaining (22.5% of deck)\n- Diamonds: 10 cards remaining (25% of deck)\n\nWith Hearts at nearly 28% of the remaining deck, keeping my two Hearts and discarding five cards gives me the best shot at completing a flush. I'll hold positions 1 and 2, removing the Clubs and Diamonds to maximize my draw chances for additional Hearts.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6,7]"}
