{"reasoning":"Let me analyze this game state:\n\n1. We're at Ante 1/8, Round 0, in the Blind Select phase\n2. We have $4\n3. No jokers, no consumables, no tags, no vouchers\n\nCurrent decision: Should we play or skip the Small Blind?\n\nSmall Blind:\n- Needs 300 chips\n- Reward: $3\n- Tag for skipping: Economy Tag (doubles money, max $40)\n\nIf we skip:\n- We get Economy Tag which doubles our $4 to $8\n- We don't get the $3 reward\n- We move to the Big Blind decision\n\nBig Blind:\n- Needs 450 chips\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Foil Tag (next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Foil)\n\nBoss Blind:\n- Needs 600 chips\n- All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\nLet me think strategically:\n\nIf we skip the Small Blind:\n- We get Economy Tag → $4 becomes $8\n- We can then decide on Big Blind\n- If we play Big Blind with $8, we could earn $4 → $12 total\n- Then we'd have to play Boss Blind with $12\n\nIf we play the Small Blind:\n- We get $3 reward → $7 total\n- We can shop after\n- Then decide on Big Blind\n\nThe Economy Tag is quite good early game since it doubles our money. $4 → $8 is a $4 gain, which is better than the $3 reward from playing the Small Blind.\n\nHowever, we need to consider:\n- Can we beat the Small Blind with no jokers? Probably yes, 300 chips is quite low\n- After beating it, we get to shop and potentially buy jokers that will help us through the rest of the ante\n- If we skip, we miss the shop opportunity until after Big Blind\n\n\n- Playing Small Blind gives us $7 to shop with immediately, while skipping delays shopping but nets us $8 after Big Blind\n- Early joker acquisition is critical, but the extra money from Economy Tag could let us buy better jokers later\n- The tradeoff is between getting jokers sooner with less money versus getting them later with more capital\n- Since Ante 1 blinds are manageable without jokers—300, 450, and 600 chips are all beatable with a basic deck—skipping Small Blind to secure the Economy Tag seems stronger overall\n- The extra $4 (50% more money) lets us buy better items at the next shop, and doubling our money through the tag outweighs missing one early shopping opportunity\n- Early jokers matter, but we have enough hands and discards to hit the chip requirements without them\n- Skipping leaves us with $1 more overall and still gives us two shops to find key cards\n\nLet me trace through the money more carefully. Playing Small nets $3, but skipping with the Economy Tag doubles our starting cash to $8. Across both scenarios, we end up with roughly the same total after the Boss blind, but skipping gives us slightly more flexibility and purchasing power when it matters most.\n\nSince Ante 1 is straightforward, I'll skip the Small Blind and secure the Economy Tag for the extra cash advantage.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
