{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 10\n- Current Blind: Big (7500 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 5886\n- Remaining chips needed: 7500 - 5886 = 1614\n- Remaining hands: 1\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +48 Chips (24 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Current Hand (10 cards):**\n1. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n2. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n3. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n5. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n7. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n8. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n9. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n10. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Available Hands:**\n- Three Kings: positions 3, 5, 9 (Three of a Kind)\n- Pair of Kings: positions 3, 5 (or 3, 9 or 5, 9)\n- Pair of 7s: positions 4, 6\n- Pair of 2s: positions 2, 8\n- Two Pair (Kings and 7s): positions 3, 5, 4, 6 (or other combinations)\n\n\n- Two Pair (Kings and 2s): positions 3, 5, 2, 8 (or other combinations)\n- Full House (Kings and 7s): positions 3, 5, 9, 4, 6\n- Full House (Kings and 2s): positions 3, 5, 9, 2, 8\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 3 (90 base chips, 8 base mult) - played twice already this round\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 base chips, 5 base mult)\n\nI need 1614 chips with one hand remaining. Since Full House has been played twice, Card Sharp would give me a 3x multiplier boost if I play it again.\n\nPlaying the Full House with Kings and 7s would score: 182 chips × 24 multiplier (8 base × 3 from Card Sharp) = 4,368 chips. Combined with my current total, that reaches 10,254 chips—well above what I need. should play positions 3, 5, 9, 4, 6. Two Pair with the same cards would only score 810 chips since Card Sharp wouldn't activate, so the Full House is clearly the better choice here.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,5,9,4,6]"}
