{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (choosing from booster pack)\n- Current Money: $7\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n5. Astronomer - Makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs FREE\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult, +30 chips) - Currently Level 1\n2. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult, +20 chips) - Currently Level 4\n3. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult, +15 chips) - Currently Level 1\n4. Pluto - Level up High Card (+1 Mult, +10 chips) - Currently Level 1\n5. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult, +20 chips) - Currently Level 4\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 7 (190 chips, 16 mult) - My main hand, played 9 times\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult) - Played 0 times\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult) - Played 13 times\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1 (60 chips, 7 mult) - Played 1 time\n- Pair: Level 1 (10 chips, 2 mult) - Played 0 times\n\n\n- High Card: Level 1 (5 chips, 1 mult) - Played 0 times\n\nI've been heavily relying on Full House for the last 7 hands to trigger Card Sharp's X3 multiplier bonus. Since Full House isn't available in this pack, I need to evaluate which alternative would best support my current strategy. Mars could strengthen Four of a Kind as a backup hand, while Mercury and Pluto offer minimal gains for hands I rarely play.\n\nVenus is tempting because Full House contains three matching cards, but the scoring would still be based on Full House's base values, not the Three of a Kind component. Without Full House as an option, I should consider what other hands Troubadour's +2 hand size makes reliable to form, and whether any of these planets would meaningfully boost those alternatives.\n\nSince I must select something from this pack, Venus upgrading to Level 5 could provide a modest backup if circumstances prevent Full House, though it wouldn't directly enhance my primary strategy. The other options don't align with my current approach, so Venus seems like the least wasteful choice despite not being ideal. Since none of these directly strengthen my Full House play, I need to pick the best fallback option. Venus at Level 5 would give me a solid backup hand if Full House becomes unavailable for some reason.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
