{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $6\n- I have 4 jokers, max 5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (52 cards × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size (8 cards instead of 6), -1 hand each round\n\n**Blind Options:**\n\n1. **Small Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 2000\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Tag for skipping: Holographic Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Holographic - +10 Mult)\n\n2. **Big Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 3000\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Tag for skipping: Buffoon Tag (Gives a free Mega Buffoon Pack)\n\n3. **Boss Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 4000\n   - Boss Description: All face cards are drawn face down\n   - Reward: $5\n\n**My Recent Performance:**\n- Ante 2 Boss (1600 needed): 2,890 chips\n- Ante 2 Small: 3,060 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Small Blind requires 2000 chips. Based on my recent performance, I was scoring 2,890-3,060 chips on Ante 2 blinds. The Small Blind of Ante 3 is only 2000 chips, which I should be able to beat easily.\n\nHowever, let me consider the skip option:\n- Holographic Tag gives me a free joker that becomes Holographic (+10 Mult)\n\n\n- This is a permanent upgrade to a joker, so I'd miss out on $3 but gain a potentially valuable joker with +10 Mult edition\n\nThe Boss Blind is concerning: \"All face cards are drawn face down\" - This is a MAJOR problem for my strategy because Shoot the Moon requires Queens to be held in hand, but if face cards are drawn face down, I can't identify which cards are Queens. I also rely heavily on being able to form Two Pairs with face cards. Without knowing which cards are which, my scoring potential drops significantly.\n\nLet me calculate if I can still hit 2000 chips without relying on Shoot the Moon. A Two Pair Level 3 with four cards (like two 10s and two 9s) gives me 60 base chips plus 38 from the cards themselves, plus 104 from Blue Joker, totaling 202 chips at 4x mult for 808 chips - nowhere near enough. But if I can somehow hold 2 Queens despite the face-down mechanic, Shoot the Moon multiplies by 26, pushing my score to 6060 chips, which easily clears 2000. The challenge is figuring out whether I can actually identify and hold the Queens when they're drawn face down.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether to skip either blind. Skipping Small Blind costs me $3 but gives Holographic Tag, while skipping Big Blind costs $4 but grants Buffoon Tag for a free Mega Buffoon Pack. However, I should just play Small Blind since I can beat 2000 chips, secure the $3 reward, and save my skip options for later. The real threat is the Boss Blind coming up, so I need to preserve my ability to identify face cards and plan accordingly.\n\nThe face-down cards are going to be a major problem for my Shoot the Moon strategy since I won't know which ones are Jacks, Queens, or Kings. I'll play this round, collect the reward, and reassess whether to skip Big Blind or face it.","action":"\"play_round\""}
