{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11 (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 3,096\n- Remaining chips needed: 6,904\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Boss Effect: Decrease level of played poker hand\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n5. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n6. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n7. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n9. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +56 Chips (currently)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Available Hands in Current Hand:**\n- Two 5s (positions 2, 4) - Pair\n- Two 2s (positions 5, 10) - Pair\n- Four Diamonds (positions 7, 8, 9, 10) - Not enough for flush\n- No straights, no three of a kind, no full house\n\nThe best I can make is:\n- Two Pair: 5s and 2s\n\n**Analysis:**\nI just played a Full House and scored 3,096 chips. \n\nWith 6,904 chips still needed across 2 hands, I'm in a tight spot. The Full House I played is now at Level 5, and while the boss will downgrade it if I play it again, I don't have the cards to form another one anyway. My only viable options are a Pair or Two Pair, and since I've already played Full House this round, Card Sharp would give me a x3 multiplier if I could repeat it—but my current cards won't allow that.\n\nTwo Pair sits at Level 4 with 80 base chips and 5x multiplier, and crucially, I haven't played it yet this round, so Card Sharp won't trigger. Let me calculate what Two Pair would score with my available cards.\n\nPlaying Two Pair with positions 2, 4, 5, 10 gives me 80 base chips plus 14 from the cards themselves, and Blue Joker adds 56 for a total of 150 chips times the 5x multiplier—that's 750 points. After the boss effect downgrades it to Level 3, the second Two Pair would have roughly 55 base chips, the same 14 card chips, and Blue Joker contributing around 50, bringing it to about 119 chips. This time Card Sharp activates for 3x multiplier on the 4x base, giving me 12x total—roughly 1,428 points on the second play.\n\nCombined, that's 2,178 chips added to my current 3,096, totaling 5,274—still short of what I need. I should explore discarding to find better cards instead. The remaining deck has one King, one Ace, and various suits spread across the remaining cards. I could pursue a pair of Aces, trips, a straight, or a flush depending on what I draw.\n\nWith only two hands left and limited discards, I need to calculate whether any realistic draw could close the gap of 6,904 chips. Getting another Ace would give me a pair worth more, and drawing three of a kind would significantly boost my score. Let me work through the probabilities with 28 cards remaining in the deck.\n\nMy best strategy is to discard the weakest cards and keep the highest-value ones. I'll hold onto the Ace of Clubs, Jack of Hearts, and 10 of Spades, then discard the 5 of Spades, 5 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 6 of Diamonds, and 4 of Diamonds. This maximizes my chances of drawing cards that either form stronger combinations or have higher individual values.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,4,5,7,8]"}
