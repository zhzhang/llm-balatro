{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12 (about to face Boss Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $7\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full - just bought Astronomer)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n5. Astronomer - Makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs FREE\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Square Joker ($4) - Not useful for my strategy\n2. Jumbo Celestial Pack ($0) - NOW FREE thanks to Astronomer!\n3. Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)\n4. Seed Money voucher ($10)\n\n**Strategy:**\nPerfect! The plan is working exactly as intended. I just bought Astronomer for $8, and now the Jumbo Celestial Pack costs $0 (free). \n\nI should definitely buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack now since it's free and will let me level up Full House (or potentially another useful hand) before the Boss Blind.\n\nMy Full House is at Level 7 (190 base chips, 16 base mult), and leveling it up more will significantly help with the Boss Blind. Each level typically adds around +30 chips and +3 mult to the base values.\n\nThe correct action is to buy the booster pack at position 1 (Jumbo Celestial Pack).","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
