{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 - just completed Small Blind\n- Current Money: $8\n- No jokers, no consumables yet\n- Max Jokers: 5, Max Consumables: 2\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. **Obelisk Joker** - Rare, holo edition, costs $11 (I only have $8)\n   - Gains X0.2 Mult per consecutive hand played without playing most played poker hand\n   - Currently X1 Mult\n   - Secondary: +10 Mult\n   - This is expensive and I can't afford it\n\n2. **Pluto Planet Card** - costs $3\n   - Levels up High Card (+1 Mult and +10 chips)\n   - I haven't been playing high card, so this seems less useful\n\n3. **Buffoon Pack** - costs $4\n   - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n   - This could be a good investment to get my first joker\n\n4. **Celestial Pack** - costs $4\n   - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately\n   - Could level up Two Pair which I've been using a lot\n\n5. **Blank Voucher** - costs $10 (I only have $8)\n   - Does nothing?\n   - Not worth buying even if I could afford it\n\n6. **Reroll** - costs $5\n   - Would leave me with $3\n\n**Analysis:**\nI've been consistently playing Two Pair (3 times in the last round), so leveling that up would be beneficial. The Celestial Pack could give me a planet card to level up Two Pair or other hands.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack could give me my first joker, which would provide ongoing benefits throughout the run.\n\nWith $8, I can afford:\n- Pluto ($3) - not very useful since I'm not playing high card\n\n\n- Buffoon Pack ($4) - get a joker\n- Celestial Pack ($4) - level up a hand type\n- Reroll ($5) - see new options\n\nSince I'm still in early Ante 1, securing a joker now could provide compounding value across the entire run. Two Pair has been my primary hand, so leveling it would help immediately, but a joker offers more long-term scaling potential. I'll go with the Buffoon Pack for $4 to grab my first joker.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
