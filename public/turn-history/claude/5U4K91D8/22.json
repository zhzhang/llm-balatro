{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Position:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $0\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n- 0 consumables\n- Gold Queen of Clubs (from previous tarot card)\n\n**Blind Options:**\n\n1. **Small Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 800\n   - Reward: $3\n   - Tag for skipping: Voucher Tag (adds one voucher to next shop)\n\n2. **Big Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 1200\n   - Reward: $4\n   - Tag for skipping: Uncommon Tag (free Uncommon Joker in shop)\n\n3. **Boss Blind:**\n   - Chips Needed: 1600\n   - Boss Description: Play only 1 hand type this round\n   - Reward: $5\n\n**My Current Strategy:**\n- Two Pair is my main hand type (Level 3: 60 base chips, 4 base mult)\n- Blue Joker gives +104 chips\n- Shoot the Moon gives +13 Mult per Queen held\n- I have a Gold Queen that gives $3 when held at end of round\n\n**Analysis of Small Blind (800 chips):**\n\nLet me estimate if I can beat this:\n- Two Pair: 60 base chips + 4 base mult\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- If I hold a Gold Queen: +13 mult from Shoot the Moon\n- If I play a hand with two pairs (4 cards), those 4 cards will add their chip values\n\nExample hand: Two pairs (say 10-10-7-7)\n- Base chips: 60\n- Cards: 10+10+7+7 = 34 chips\n\n\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Total chips: 60 + 34 + 104 = 198 chips\n- Base mult: 4\n- Shoot the Moon (1 Gold Queen held): +13 mult\n- Total mult: 4 + 13 = 17 mult\n- Total score: 198 × 17 = 3,366 chips\n\nThis easily clears 800. Now I'm weighing whether to skip for the Voucher Tag—extra vouchers in future shops could unlock better jokers and upgrades, which might be more valuable than the $3 reward.\n\nBut I'm broke right now. Playing this hand nets me $3 from the Small Blind, plus $3 from the Gold Queen trigger, and potentially more from interest or hand bonuses—that's roughly $6 minimum. Skipping means staying at $0 going into the Big Blind, which feels risky. Since I can comfortably win this round, passing up the income seems like a poor trade-off.\n\nThe Big Blind offers an Uncommon Tag for a free Uncommon Joker in the shop, which is genuinely strong. But first I need to verify I can actually beat the Big Blind with my current deck before deciding whether skipping now makes sense.\n\nPlaying the Small Blind is the right move. I have the chips to win easily, I desperately need the cash injection, and securing $6 puts me in a much better position to evaluate whether skipping the Big Blind becomes viable. The Voucher Tag isn't worth the opportunity cost when I'm starting from zero dollars.","action":"\"play_round\""}
