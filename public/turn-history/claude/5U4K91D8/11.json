{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (need 450 chips)\n- Current Money: $0\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 4\n\n**My Inventory:**\n- Blue Joker: +88 chips (down from +104, because cards have been dealt from the deck)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n4. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n5. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n7. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n8. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a pair of Jacks (Jack of Spades and Jack of Hearts)\n- I have a pair of 3s (3 of Hearts and 3 of Diamonds)\n- So I can make a Two Pair!\n\n**Two Pair calculation:**\nTwo Pair Level 2: 40 base chips, 3 base mult\n\nIf I play: Jack of Spades, Jack of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 3 of Diamonds, and any fifth card (let's say Ace of Spades):\n- Base chips: 40\n- Card chips from the two pairs: 10 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 26\n- Note: The Ace of Spades won't add chips because it's not part of the two pair\n- Blue Joker: +88 chips\n- Total chips: 40 + 26 + 88 = 154\n- Mult: 3\n\n\n- Final score: 154 × 3 = 462 chips\n\nThis clears the 450 blind. I'll select the two pair with positions 3, 5, 6, and 8, plus the Ace to round out five cards.\n\nLooking at what I can form: I have a pair of Jacks and a pair of 3s available. While I hold four spades, that's not enough for a flush. Two pair is my strongest option here. The fifth card won't contribute to scoring, so I should just add my highest card—the Ace of Spades.\n\nCalculating the score: Two pair gives 40 base chips. The four cards in my hand (Jack of Spades, Jack of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 3 of Diamonds) contribute 26 chips total. With the Blue Joker adding 88 chips, I get 154 chips before multipliers. At 3x multiplier, that's 462 chips—better than my previous best of 450.\n\nI'll play the four cards at positions 3, 5, 6, and 8 to form this hand.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,5,6,8]"}
