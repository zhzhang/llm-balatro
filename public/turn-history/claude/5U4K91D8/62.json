{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state and context.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 9\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small (5000 chips needed)\n- Current Money: $2\n- Current Chips: 0/5000\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +86 Chips (based on remaining cards in deck)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand\n\n**Current Hand (10 cards):**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n4. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n5. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n6. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n7. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n8. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n9. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n10. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**Available Hand Types:**\n- Two Pair: Queens (positions 1, 6), Aces (positions 5, 8)\n- Two Pair: Queens (positions 1, 6), 6s (positions 3, 9)\n- Two Pair: Queens (positions 1, 6), 5s (positions 4, 10)\n- Two Pair: Aces (positions 5, 8), 6s (positions 3, 9)\n\n\n- Two Pair: Aces (positions 5, 8), 5s (positions 4, 10)\n- Two Pair: 6s (positions 3, 9), 5s (positions 4, 10)\n- Single pairs available with Queens, Aces, 6s, or 5s\n- Flush possibilities exist but incomplete: 4 Spades, 3 Hearts, 3 Diamonds\n\nTwo Pair is my strongest option here. With Level 4 Two Pair providing 80 base chips and 5 base multiplier, combined with my Jokers—especially Card Sharp for the X3 multiplier if I replay it—I can generate solid chip gains. The Space Joker also offers potential level upgrades on subsequent plays.\n\nFor the first Two Pair hand (Queens and Aces), I'm looking at 208 chips × 5 mult = 1,040 chips. Playing Two Pair again triggers Card Sharp's X3 multiplier, boosting the second play to 3,120 chips. Across both plays, that's 4,160 chips total, which sets up a strong foundation for the remaining rounds. I can play up to 5 cards, but adding a fifth card won't help unless it's part of the hand itself, so I'll stick with just the four cards needed for the pair.\n\nPlaying Queens and Aces from positions 1, 5, 6, 8 should give me roughly 1,040 chips when accounting for the base Two Pair value, the card values, and the Blue Joker bonus multiplied by the base multiplier. Then with Card Sharp triggered on the second hand, I'd get triple that amount.\n\nEven combining both plays, I'm still falling short of my target. I could try discarding to find better cards, but the current deck doesn't offer obvious upgrades—I already have solid pairs. I'll proceed with this Two Pair strategy and hope the Space Joker provides enough additional value to close the gap.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,5,6,8]"}
