{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 4\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Money: $0\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Blue Joker: +88 chips (44 cards in deck × 2)\n- Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n2. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n3. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n4. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI can see I have THREE KINGS (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds) - this is a Three of a Kind! That's positions 1, 5, 6.\n\nWait, let me check if I have any two pairs:\n- Kings: positions 1, 5, 6 (three of them)\n- 6s: positions 2, 8 (two of them)\n\nSo I have a Full House! Three Kings and Two 6s.\n\nLet me also check what else I can make:\n- Three of a Kind: Kings (positions 1, 5, 6)\n- Pair: 6s (positions 2, 8)\n- Full House: Kings + 6s (positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 8)\n\nWait, the previous actions mention I have a Gold Queen from using The Devil tarot card. Let me look at my current hand - I have a Queen of Diamonds at position 7. This might be the Gold Queen! If I hold it, I get +13 Mult from Shoot the Moon AND $3 at end of round.\n\n\nNow I need to compare my scoring options. If I play the Full House with the three Kings and two 6s, that's 40 base chips with 4x multiplier, plus 42 chips from the cards themselves and 88 from the Blue Joker, giving me 170 chips total before multiplier. But this leaves out the Queen entirely, so I'd miss the Shoot the Moon bonus.\n\nPlaying just the three Kings while holding the Queen is much stronger. The three of a kind gives me 30 base chips with 3x multiplier, plus another 30 from the cards and 88 from the Blue Joker for 148 chips. But the real power comes from keeping that Queen—it triggers Shoot the Moon for +13 multiplier, bringing my total multiplier to 16x. That's 148 × 16 = 2,368 chips, which easily clears my 800 chip target.\n\nWait, I should reconsider Two Pair instead. I have three Kings and two 6s, so I could play two of each for a Level 3 Two Pair with 60 base chips and 4x multiplier. Let me check if that's better with the Queen held.\n\nPlaying positions 1, 5, 2, 8 gives me two Kings and two 6s. The card chips total 32, plus the Blue Joker's 88 chips brings me to 180 chips. With the Queen held for Shoot the Moon, I get 13 extra multiplier on top of the base 4, reaching 17x total. That's 180 × 17 = 3,060 chips—significantly better than Three of a Kind. I'll go with this play.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,8]"}
