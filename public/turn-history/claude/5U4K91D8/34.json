{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $6\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 4)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (52 cards × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n- Jupiter (Planet) - $3 - Levels up Flush (not useful for my Two Pair strategy)\n- Bull (Uncommon Joker) - $6 - +2 chips per $1 (currently +12 chips)\n- Standard Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards\n- Director's Cut (Voucher) - $10 - Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Strategy:**\nI'm playing exclusively Two Pair (Level 3: 60 base chips, 4 base mult). Recent scores were 2,890-3,060 chips on Ante 2.\n\n**Options with $6:**\n1. Buy Jupiter for $3 - Not useful, levels up Flush not Two Pair\n2. Buy Bull for $6 - Would give me +12 chips, but this is much weaker than my Blue Joker's +104 chips\n3. Buy Standard Pack for $4 - Could add cards to deck, leaving $2\n4. Reroll shop for $6 - Could find better options, but leaves me with $0\n5. Just proceed to round select - Save the money\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune didn't trigger, so my joker lineup stays at four. Bull's +12 chip boost is negligible compared to Blue Joker's contribution. Jupiter doesn't synergize with my Two Pair focus. Rerolling would consume all my cash but might surface a Two Pair planet or stronger joker. Standard Pack is uncertain value. I should consider whether holding onto the $6 for future rounds offers better opportunities than any of these immediate purchases.\n\nAnte 3 looms with much steeper chip thresholds. My current hand—Two Pair Level 3 at 60 base chips with 4 mult, Blue Joker providing +104 chips, Shoot the Moon multiplying Queens, and Troubadour expanding my hand to 8 cards—needs to generate enough points. Playing a two pair with four cards (like two tens and two jacks) gives roughly 100 chips before bonuses, then Blue Joker pushes it to 204, though that bonus shrinks as the deck depletes. The base multiplier of 4 applies on top of this.\n\nIf I hold two Queens without playing them, each contributes +13 mult, bringing my total multiplier to 30. That yields around 6,120 chips per hand. Looking back at my recent scores—2,890 and 3,060 chips in Ante 2—I'm tracking well above what Ante 3 will demand (roughly 900 for small, 1,400 for big, 2,400 for boss). The real concern is exponential scaling in later antes, where my current setup may plateau.\n\nThe decision comes down to whether I should spend my remaining $6 now or preserve it. Rerolling could surface a Two Pair planet card to level it up, a stronger joker, or better consumables, but that leaves me with nothing. Alternatively, I earn $1 per unplayed hand plus interest at $1 per $5 held—so keeping the money might compound better. My scoring is solid for Ante 3, but I need to think strategically about what actually moves the needle: leveling Two Pair, acquiring mult-scaling jokers, or finding card enhancements. Since the Arcana Pack already cost me $4 without delivering useful options, I should be more deliberate with my remaining capital.\n\nI'll skip the reroll and move forward. The round itself will generate income through remaining hands and interest, giving me another shop opportunity after I clear the blind.","action":"\"round_select\""}
