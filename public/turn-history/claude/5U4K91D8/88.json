{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big Blind\n- Chips Needed: 16,500\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $8\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n3. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips, Gold Card enhancement - $3 if held at end of round)\n6. 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n9. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n10. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +86 Chips (currently - based on 43 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Showman - Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n\n**Possible Hands I can make:**\nLooking at my hand:\n- Two Pairs: Queens (Hearts & Clubs) and Jacks (Hearts & Diamonds) = Two Pair\n\n\n- Also: Queens and 8s (Spades & Diamonds) = Two Pair\n- Pair of Queens: 3, 5\n- Pair of Jacks: 4, 8\n- Pair of 8s: 2, 10\n\nI don't have a Full House available in my current hand, which is my strongest hand type. I can form two different Two Pair combinations, but no stronger poker hands. Let me evaluate playing Two Pair now versus discarding to find better options.\n\nPlaying Two Pair (Queens + Jacks) with the Blue Joker would score around 1,030 chips—far short of the 16,500 needed. Alternatively, I could discard cards hoping to draw into a Full House, which would be significantly more powerful at Level 6. The deck still has three tens, two Queens, and multiple Kings, Aces, and 2s available. Since I already have two Queens and two Jacks, drawing a third Queen or Jack would complete a Full House, which is a much stronger hand type than Two Pair. I should discard the cards that don't contribute to my pairs. The 10 of Spades, 5 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, and 9 of Diamonds are all singletons, so I'll get rid of those and keep my three pairs intact. Drawing four new cards gives me a solid chance at hitting a third card in one of my ranks to complete the Full House.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,6,7,9]"}
