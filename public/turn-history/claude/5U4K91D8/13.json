{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (choosing from a booster pack)\n- Current Money: $1\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n\n**Upcoming Challenge:**\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed\n- Boss effect: All Spade cards are debuffed\n\n**My Strategy:**\n- I've been successfully playing Two Pair (Level 2: 40 chips, 3 mult)\n- Last hand scored 462 chips with Two Pair\n- Need to reach 600 chips for the Boss Blind\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult, +30 chips)\n2. Jupiter - Level up Flush (+2 Mult, +15 chips)\n3. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind (+2 Mult, +20 chips)\n4. Mercury - Level up Pair (+1 Mult, +15 chips)\n5. Uranus - Level up Two Pair (+1 Mult, +20 chips) - **This is Level 2!**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe most obvious choice is **Uranus** (position 5) since:\n1. Two Pair is my main hand type (played 4 times)\n2. It's already at Level 2, and Uranus will level it up to Level 3\n3. This will give Two Pair +20 base chips and +1 mult\n\nLet me calculate what Two Pair Level 3 would give me:\n- Current Two Pair Level 2: 40 base chips, 3 base mult\n- After Uranus: 60 base chips, 4 base mult\n\nWith the same hand I played last time (two Jacks and two 3s):\n- Base chips: 60 (up from 40)\n- Card chips: 10 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 26\n\n\n- Blue Joker: +104 (assuming similar deck state)\n- Total chips: 60 + 26 + 104 = 190\n- Mult: 4 (up from 3)\n- Final score: 190 × 4 = 760 chips\n\nThis would comfortably beat the Boss Blind (600 chips needed). The other options—Mars, Jupiter, and Venus—all upgrade hand types I haven't played yet, making them unreliable choices compared to strengthening my proven Two Pair strategy.\n\nMercury could serve as a fallback, but Two Pair remains the stronger foundation. Uranus is the clear winner here since it amplifies my most consistent hand type and delivers the scoring I need to advance.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [5]"}
