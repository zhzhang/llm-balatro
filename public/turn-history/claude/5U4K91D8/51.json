{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 7\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Boss Blind: \"All face cards are drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Reward: $5\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (currently +2 per card in deck)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Allows duplicates in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\n**Boss Blind Analysis:**\nThe boss effect says \"All face cards are drawn face down.\" This is a major problem because:\n- Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) will be face down, meaning I won't be able to see them or use them properly\n- My Shoot the Moon joker relies on Queens being held in hand - but if they're face down, this joker becomes useless\n- Face cards are important for forming pairs in my Two Pair strategy\n\nHowever, the key thing is that the boss says face cards are \"drawn face down\" - this likely means they're debuffed/hidden but might still participate in forming hands. Let me think about what this means for my strategy.\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI've been successfully playing Two Pair throughout the game. My last few hands show:\n- Two Pair - 8,640 chips\n- Two Pair - 960 chips\n- Full House - 2,584 chips\n- Two Pair - 2,890 chips\n\nMy Two Pair is Level 4 with Base Chips 80 and Base Mult 5.\n\n**Available Commands:**\n- play_round - Play the current round\n- use_consumable - I have no consumables\n\n\n- sell_consumable - I have no consumables\n- rearrange_jokers - Could rearrange my jokers\n- sell_joker - Could sell a joker\n\nSince this is BLIND_SELECT and I'm facing a Boss Blind that can't be skipped, I need to play_round. Before I do, I should consider if rearranging my jokers helps—Blue Joker should trigger first for chip generation, then Shoot the Moon for mult on Queens, though the face-down effect will likely neutralize that joker's value this round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
