{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Boss Blind: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Current Chips: 18,176\n- Chips still needed: 22,000 - 18,176 = 3,824\n- Remaining hands: 1 (THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE LAST HAND!)\n- Remaining discards: 0 (no more discards available)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n3. 3 of Spades (+3 chips) with Mult Enhancement (+4 Mult)\n4. 9 of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n5. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n7. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n8. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n9. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n10. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - Currently +28 Chips (2 per card remaining in deck = 14 cards)\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice (already used this round - won't trigger again)\n5. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n\n**Available Hands:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Three 3s: positions 2, 3, 10 (3 of Spades, 3 of Spades with Mult, 3 of Diamonds)\n- Two Aces: positions 1, 8 (Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds)\n\n\n- A Full House is possible with these cards. The three 3s paired with the two Aces would give me a Level 7 Full House with 190 base chips and 16 base mult. The five cards contribute 31 chips total (11 + 3 + 3 + 11 + 3), plus the Mult Enhancement adds 4 more multiplier.\n\n- The Blue Joker adds another 28 chips from the 14 remaining cards. This brings me to 249 total chips × 20 multiplier = 4,980 points. Combined with my current 18,176, I'd reach 23,156 chips—surpassing the 22,000 threshold needed.\n\n- I need to select positions 1, 2, 3, 8, and 10 to form this hand.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,8,10]"}
