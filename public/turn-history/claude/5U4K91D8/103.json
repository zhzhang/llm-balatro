{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Boss Blind: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n2. Queen of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n3. 7 of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n4. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips, Gold Card)\n6. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n8. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n9. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n10. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - Currently +76 Chips (2 chips per card remaining in deck)\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n5. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Three Queens: Queen of Hearts (debuffed), Queen of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds\n- Two Kings: King of Hearts (debuffed), King of Clubs\n- Two 7s: 7 of Hearts (debuffed), 7 of Diamonds\n\nSo I could make:\n- **Full House with 3 Queens + 2 Kings** (positions 2, 5, 8 for Queens and 1, 4 for Kings)\n- **Full House with 3 Queens + 2 Sevens** (positions 2, 5, 8 for Queens and 3, 10 for Sevens)\n\n\n- **Full House with 2 Kings + 3 Queens** (same as first option)\n\nFor a Full House with 3 Queens and 2 Kings: the base hand scores 190 chips with 16x multiplier. The Queen of Clubs and Queen of Diamonds each contribute 10 chips, King of Clubs adds another 10, while the debuffed Heart cards contribute nothing. That's 30 chips from the cards themselves, plus the Blue Joker's 76 chips.\n\nThe calculation comes to 296 total chips × 16 multiplier = 4,736 chips for this first hand. Since Card Sharp requires the same hand type twice to trigger, it won't activate yet. However, if I play another Full House next, the Card Sharp bonus would kick in with a 3x multiplier applied to that second hand's score.\n\nPlaying the same hand type again would give me a much stronger second round—the multiplier jumps to 48x, which on similar scoring would yield around 14,000+ chips. Across both hands, I'm looking at roughly 19,000 chips total, which falls short of my 22,000 target. I should commit to this Full House now to set up the Card Sharp activation for the next hand, where the multiplier boost will make a real difference.\n\nI'll select the three Queens at positions 2, 5, and 8, paired with the two Kings at positions 1 and 4.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,4,5,8]"}
