{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 7\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (Big Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 3000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n4. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n5. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n6. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n7. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n9. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +84 chips (42 cards remaining × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Duplicates allowed in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand already played this round\n\n**Possible Hands in Current Hand:**\n- Flush (5 Spades): positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- Two Pair (Queens and something else): I have 2 Queens (positions 1 and 6), but I need another pair\n- Pair of Queens: positions 1 and 6\n\nWait, let me check more carefully:\n- Queens: positions 1 and 6\n- Jacks: position 2 only\n- 8s: position 3 only\n\n\n- 6s: position 4 only\n- 4s: position 5 only\n- 3s: position 7 only\n- 7s: position 8 only\n- 5s: position 9 only\n- 2s: position 10 only\n\nNo natural Two Pair available. My strongest plays are a Flush with the five Spades (35 chips, 4 mult at Level 1) or a Pair of Queens (10 chips, 2 mult). The Flush is clearly superior, though I should verify the scoring with my Jokers applied.\n\nPlaying the Spades at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 gives me 35 base chips plus 38 from the cards themselves. The Blue Joker adds 84 chips for a total of 157. With the base multiplier of 4 and Shoot the Moon triggering from the Queen of Hearts in my hand, I get 17 total multiplier. That yields 2,669 chips—still short of the 3,000 I need. Two Pair isn't an option since I can't duplicate any of my pairs.\n\nWith 4 discards and 3 hands remaining, I should focus on building toward Two Pair, which would give me 80 chips and 5 multiplier at Level 4. I'd keep both Queens and discard the other cards to hunt for a second pair. Alternatively, I could reconsider the Flush strategy with Card Sharp—playing it twice might generate enough chips to reach my target.\n\nLet me verify: a second Flush with Card Sharp's 3x multiplier would yield around 8,000 chips, well above the 3,000 threshold. However, with only 8 Spades left in the deck after my initial play, drawing another complete Flush is unlikely. The Two Pair approach seems more realistic given my remaining deck composition.\n\nIf I keep the Queens and discard everything else, Two Pair (Level 4) gives me 80 base chips plus 20 from the pair of Queens. Assuming I draw another pair like 7s for 14 chips, plus the Blue Joker's 84 chip boost, I'd have 198 chips with a 5x multiplier—totaling just 990 chips. That's insufficient on its own, but applying Card Sharp's 3x multiplier to a second Two Pair hand would push it to around 2,970 chips, nearly reaching my goal.\n\nMy approach: discard the Jack, 8, 6, 4, and 3 to maximize chances of completing a second pair with the Queens.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,7]"}
