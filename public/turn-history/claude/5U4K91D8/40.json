{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6 (just beat Small Blind, in shop)\n- Current Money: $6\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 5, so at capacity)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (52 cards in deck × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Allows duplicates in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand already played this round (just bought)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Even Steven (Common, $4): +4 Mult per even-ranked card scored\n- Celestial Pack ($4): Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards\n- Mega Standard Pack ($8): Choose 2 of 5 Playing cards  \n- Director's Cut ($10): Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $6 left after buying Card Sharp. Looking at my options:\n\n1. **Even Steven ($4)**: Could add more multiplicative power. With Two Pair, if I play even cards (10s, 8s, 6s, 4s, 2s), I'd get +4 Mult per card. If 4 cards are even, that's +16 Mult. Combined with Shoot the Moon and Card Sharp, this could be strong. But I'm at max jokers (5/5).\n\n2. **Celestial Pack ($4)**: Could level up Two Pair further (currently Level 3). Each level adds chips and mult to the base. This is useful for scaling.\n\n3. **Mega Standard Pack ($8)**: Too expensive, I only have $6.\n\n\n4. **Director's Cut ($10)**: Also out of reach.\n\n5. **Reroll Shop ($5)**: I could spend $5 to see new options, leaving me with just $1. Since I'm at capacity with jokers, I'd need to sell one first to make room for Even Steven. Blue Joker provides solid chip scaling, Shoot the Moon is essential for my Queen strategy, and Showman enables shop duplicates. Troubadour's +2 hand size is valuable for flexibility, though it costs a hand each round.\n\nCard Sharp just came in with X3 Mult on repeated hands, which is powerful. Showman doesn't directly contribute to scoring, so swapping it for Even Steven could work—that would add +16 Mult if I play four even cards in a Two Pair. My current Two Pair with one Queen held scores around 10,404 chips on the second play with Card Sharp's multiplier. Adding Even Steven would push that higher if I can construct a hand with four even cards.\n\nHowever, looking back at recent hands, I've mostly played Kings and 9s, which aren't even—so Even Steven's reliability is questionable. The Celestial Pack might be the safer choice instead, leveling Two Pair from Level 3 to Level 4, which would increase both base chips and multiplier on every play.\n\nI'm weighing my options with $6: buying the Celestial Pack for $4 to upgrade my main hand, trading Showman for Even Steven at a net cost of $2, rerolling for $5, or saving for upcoming shop opportunities. Since Big Blind and Boss Blind are coming in Ante 3 with higher chip requirements, I need to prioritize consistent scaling over risky upgrades.\n\nEven Steven doesn't align with my deck composition, and rerolling leaves me too thin on resources. The Celestial Pack directly strengthens Two Pair, which is my core strategy, and $2 remaining gives me flexibility for future rounds where I can generate more capital anyway.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
