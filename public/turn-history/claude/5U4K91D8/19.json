{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $4\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Blue Joker: +104 chips\n  2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n- Max Jokers: 5 (I have 2, so 3 slots remaining)\n- Two Pair: Level 3 (60 base chips, 4 base mult)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Arrowhead: +50 chips per Spade played (Uncommon, $7) - Too expensive and risky given Spades were debuffed last boss\n2. Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 3 Tarot cards ($4) - I have exactly $4\n3. Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards ($4) - I have exactly $4\n4. Blank Voucher: Does nothing? ($10) - Too expensive\n5. Reroll: $5 - Can't afford\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just bought Shoot the Moon, which gives +13 Mult per Queen held in hand. This synergizes well with my Two Pair strategy - if I hold Queens in hand while playing other pairs, I get the mult boost.\n\nWith only $4 left, my options are:\n1. Arcana Pack ($4) - Tarot cards can enhance playing cards or jokers\n2. Standard Pack ($4) - Add a playing card to deck\n3. Do nothing and proceed to round_select\n\nLet me think about what would be most valuable:\n\n**Arcana Pack considerations:**\nTarot cards can:\n- Enhance playing cards (making them Bonus, Mult, Wild, Glass, Steel, Stone, Gold, or Lucky)\n- Turn cards into other ranks/suits\n- Enhance jokers with editions\n\nGiven I have Shoot the Moon which benefits from holding Queens, getting tarot cards that could:\n\n\n- Create more Queens (The Fool, The Magician, etc.)\n- Enhance my existing cards\n- Add editions to jokers\n\n**Standard Pack considerations:**\n- Could add a Queen to my deck to improve Shoot the Moon synergy\n- But I already have 4 Queens total in the deck (2 remaining according to the deck composition before)\n- Less immediately impactful than tarot enhancements\n\n**Proceeding to round_select:**\n- I'd keep my $4 and earn interest next round\n- But $4 doesn't earn interest (need $5 for $1 interest)\n- Missing out on potential immediate value\n\nThe Arcana Pack looks most promising since tarot cards offer more flexibility—I could generate additional Queens to maximize my Shoot the Moon multiplier, enhance existing cards with powerful editions, or boost my jokers. A Standard Pack would only add one card to the deck, which feels less impactful than the transformation potential of tarots.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
