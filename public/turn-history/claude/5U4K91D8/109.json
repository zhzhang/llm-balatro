{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- I just beat the Boss Blind of Ante 5\n\n**Inventory:**\n- 5 Jokers (at max capacity):\n  1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (currently 53 cards in deck)\n  2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n  3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n  4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n  5. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n- No consumables (max 2)\n- $7 money\n\n**Shop:**\n- Flower Pot: X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits - $6\n- Runner: Gains +15 Chips per Straight played - $5\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards - $6\n- Celestial Pack: Choose 1 of 3 Planet cards - $0 (FREE due to Astronomer!)\n- Paint Brush voucher: +1 hand size - $10\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI've been heavily relying on Full House (Level 7, 190 base chips, 16 base mult). Looking at my last played hands, they're all Full Houses scoring between 4,000 and 14,940 chips.\n\nAnte 6 will have significantly higher chip requirements. I need to think about what will help me most:\n\n1. **Celestial Pack (FREE)**: This is a no-brainer. I should definitely grab this since it's free thanks to Astronomer. I can level up Full House even more, or potentially level up another hand type.\n\n2. **Flower Pot ($6)**: This gives X3 Mult if I play all 4 suits. \n\nThe Flower Pot is tempting since it multiplies my score, but relying on all four suits in a five-card hand is inconsistent, especially with boss blinds potentially debuffing specific suits. Runner doesn't synergize with my Full House focus, and Paint Brush is out of budget anyway.\n\nGiven my $7, I should grab the free Celestial Pack to strengthen my primary hand, then decide if I have room for one more purchase. the mult would be 16 * 3 * 3 = 144 mult on the second Full House! That's massive.\n\nI should grab the free Celestial Pack first to push Full House further, then use my remaining $7 to pick up Flower Pot for $6. That leaves me with $1 to work with.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
