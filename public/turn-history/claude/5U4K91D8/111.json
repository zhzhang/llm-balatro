{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- I just upgraded Full House from Level 7 to Level 8 (215 base chips, 18 base mult)\n\n**Inventory:**\n- 5 Jokers (at max capacity):\n  1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (53 cards in deck)\n  2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n  3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n  4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n  5. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n- No consumables (max 2)\n- $7 money\n\n**Shop:**\n- Flower Pot: X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits - $6\n- Runner: Gains +15 Chips per Straight played - $5\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards - $6\n- Paint Brush voucher: +1 hand size - $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm entering Ante 6 which will have much higher chip requirements. My strategy has been heavily focused on Full House, which is now Level 8 with 215 base chips and 18 base mult.\n\nLet me think about what will help most:\n\n1. **Flower Pot ($6)**: This gives X3 Mult if I play all 4 suits in one hand. This is HUGE for multiplication. With my current setup:\n   - Full House base: 215 chips, 18 mult\n   - Blue Joker: +106 chips\n   - Card Sharp: X3 mult on second play\n   - If I also had Flower Pot: X3 mult\n   \n   On the second Full House with all 4 suits:\n   - Base mult: 18\n   - Card Sharp: X3 = 54 mult\n   - Flower Pot: X3 = 162 mult\n   \n   That's a massive multiplier! Even with modest chips (say 321 from base + Blue Joker + played cards), that's 52,002 chips!\n\n2. **Runner ($5)**: This gains +15 chips if I play a Straight. I haven't been playing Straights, so this doesn't fit my strategy.\n\n3. **Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6)**: Tarot cards can modify my deck or jokers. Could be useful but uncertain.\n\n4. **Paint Brush voucher ($10)**: Adds hand size, but I'm already at capacity with Troubadour providing +2 hand size. This would be redundant and too expensive.\n\n5. **Reroll ($5)**: Could see different options.\n\nThe real challenge with Flower Pot is the requirement itself. I need all 4 suits in a single 5-card hand while maintaining a Full House pattern. With only 5 cards total, getting 3 of one rank and 2 of another while spanning all 4 suits is extremely restrictive—the three-of-a-kind would need to come from 3 different suits, and the pair would have to cover the remaining suit. This severely limits which hands can actually trigger the multiplier.\n\nHowever, Troubadour's +2 hand size means I'm drawing 10 cards, which gives me substantially more flexibility to construct the right combination. More importantly, stacking Flower Pot's X3 with Card Sharp's X3 creates a X9 multiplicative effect on qualifying hands—that's the real payoff. My baseline would sit around 351 chips with 162 multiplier, and that scales dramatically when both bonuses activate together.\n\nThe math is compelling: I'd generate over 56,000 chips per hand, easily clearing Ante 6's threshold. Spending $6 on Flower Pot is the right move here, leaving me with $1 to spare. I'm ready to advance.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
