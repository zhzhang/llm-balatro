{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $3\n- I just successfully bought Flower Pot!\n\n**Current Jokers (5/5 - at max capacity):**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (53 cards in deck)\n2. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n3. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n4. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n5. Flower Pot - X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits\n\n**Shop Remaining:**\n- Runner: +15 Chips per Straight played - $5 (I don't have enough money)\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards - $6 (I don't have enough money)\n- Paint Brush voucher: +1 hand size - $10 (I don't have enough money)\n- Reroll cost: $5 (I don't have enough money)\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI'm focused on playing Full House (Level 8: 215 base chips, 18 base mult). I now have:\n- Blue Joker for +106 chips\n- Card Sharp for X3 mult on second play\n- Flower Pot for X3 mult when all 4 suits are present\n- Troubadour for +2 hand size to help find the right cards\n\nThis gives me X9 multiplicative effect (X3 * X3) on the second Full House that contains all 4 suits!\n\n**What should I do now?**\nI only have $3 left, which isn't enough to buy anything else in the shop:\n- Runner costs $5\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack costs $6\n- Paint Brush costs $10\n\n\n- Reroll costs $5\n\nSince I can't afford any additional purchases and there are no free planet cards available in the shop anyway, I should move forward to the round. My X9 multiplier on Full Houses with all four suits should be sufficient to handle the higher chip requirements in Ante 6.","action":"\"round_select\""}
