{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $8\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind**: 11,000 chips needed, rewards $3\n   - Tag for skipping: Orbital Tag (Upgrade a poker hand by 3 levels)\n2. **Big Blind**: 16,500 chips needed, rewards $4\n   - Tag for skipping: Garbage Tag (Gives $1 per unused discard - would give $31)\n3. **Boss Blind**: 22,000 chips needed, rewards $5\n   - Boss Description: All Heart cards are debuffed\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips\n2. Showman - Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade played hand\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult) - my main hand\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent hands:\n- Full House - 7,920 chips (highest recent score)\n- Full House - 4,800 chips\n- Full House - 4,368 chips\n- Full House - 3,096 chips\n\nLet me estimate what I can score with Full House on the Small Blind (11,000 chips needed):\n\nBase Full House at Level 6: 165 chips, 14 mult\nBlue Joker: +106 chips\nCard Sharp: x3 mult (if I play the same hand twice)\n\nFirst Full House:\n- Base: 165 chips, 14 mult\n- Blue Joker: +106 chips = 271 chips\n\n\n- Cards in hand contribute their chip values\n- Let's say I have 5 cards total, and 3 of them are in the Full House (e.g., two 10s and three 5s)\n  - Two 10s = 20 chips\n  - Three 5s = 15 chips\n  - Total chips: 271 + 20 + 15 = 306 chips\n- Mult: 14 base\n- Score: 306 × 14 = 4,284 chips\n\nSecond Full House (with Card Sharp active):\n- Same chips: 306\n- Mult: 14 base × 3 = 42\n- Score: 306 × 42 = 12,852 chips\n\nTotal across both hands: 4,284 + 12,852 = 17,136 chips, which exceeds the 11,000 chip requirement for the Small Blind.\n\nNow I'm weighing whether to skip the Small Blind and claim the Orbital Tag instead. This would let me upgrade any hand by 3 levels—Full House from 6 to 9, Two Pair from 4 to 7, or something else entirely. The Full House upgrade seems particularly valuable since it would significantly boost my scoring potential. The tradeoff is forgoing the $3 reward from playing the blind.\n\nThere's also the Garbage Tag to consider if I skip the Big Blind, which would give $31 for unused discards. But I need to ensure I can still clear both the Big Blind (16,500) and Boss Blind (22,000) without those extra rewards. The permanent hand level increase from Orbital seems worth the short-term cash loss, especially since my current chip total should handle the remaining blinds.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
