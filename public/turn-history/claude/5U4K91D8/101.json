{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $2\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2\n\n**Boss Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Boss Description: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (2 chips per remaining card in deck)\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice in round\n5. Astronomer - Makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs FREE\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 7 (190 chips, 16 mult) - My main hand, played 9 times\n- Four of a Kind: Level 2 (90 chips, 10 mult)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult)\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\nRecent Full House plays scored between 3,096 and 12,768 chips.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis is a Boss Blind that debuffs all Heart cards. This means any Heart cards in my hand will have their abilities and chip values disabled. However, they will STILL participate in forming a hand type.\n\nMy strategy has been:\n1. Play Full House consistently\n2. Use Card Sharp's X3 multiplier (activates when playing the same hand type twice in a round)\n3. Get +106 chips from Blue Joker\n4. Have +2 hand size from Troubadour (though -1 hand per round)\n\n\n5. Calculate expected Full House scoring by combining base hand value (190 chips, 16 mult) with Blue Joker's bonus and non-Heart card contributions, then apply Card Sharp's X3 multiplier on the second play to maximize damage against the 22,000 chip requirement. Hearts.\n\nI can't skip this Boss Blind, so I need to play the round. The target is 22,000 chips. Based on my recent hands scoring 10,000-12,000 chips each with Card Sharp active, I should be able to reach that in two hands. Troubadour reduces my hand count by 1 each round, but I have enough attempts. Since I can select non-Heart cards for my Full House plays, the Hearts debuff shouldn't significantly impact my score.","action":"\"play_round\""}
