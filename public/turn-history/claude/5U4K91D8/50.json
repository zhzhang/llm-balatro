{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 7 - about to face Boss Blind\n- Current Money: $2\n- All 5 joker slots filled\n- Just added a 3 of Spades (Mult) to my deck\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (53 cards × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Duplicates allowed in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Wrathful Joker: +3 Mult per Spade card scored - $5\n- Joker Stencil: X1 Mult per empty joker slot (currently X0) - $8\n- Standard Pack: $4\n- Director's Cut (Voucher): $10\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $2, which means:\n- Can't buy Wrathful Joker ($5)\n- Can't buy Joker Stencil ($8)\n- Can't buy Standard Pack ($4)\n- Can't buy Director's Cut ($10)\n- Can't reroll shop ($6)\n\nWith only $2, I have very limited options. I could:\n1. Sell a joker to get more money\n2. Just proceed to round select with my current setup\n\nLooking at my jokers:\n- Blue Joker: Very valuable, provides +106 chips\n- Shoot the Moon: Valuable when I have Queens in hand\n- Showman: Useful for shop duplicates but doesn't directly help scoring\n- Troubadour: +2 hand size is very valuable for hand flexibility\n- Card Sharp: This is my core engine - X3 Mult on second play\n\n\n- My Two Pair strategy has been working extremely well. I'm about to face a Boss Blind. With only $2 and no viable purchases, I should just proceed to the Boss Blind.\n\nHowever, let me think if there's any strategic value in selling something:\n\nIf I sell Showman ($2), I'd have $4 total. That would let me:\n- Buy the Standard Pack for $4\n\nBut I just bought a Standard Pack. Do I need another one immediately before the boss? Probably not necessary.\n\nIf I sell Showman ($2) and buy nothing, I'd have $4 going into the boss round. At the end of the round, I'll earn money based on remaining hands and interest. Having $4 instead of $2 doesn't make a huge difference for interest ($4 gives $0 interest, need $5 for $1 interest).\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the Wrathful Joker option. If I sell Showman for $2, I'd have $4. That's still not enough for Wrathful Joker ($5).\n\nIf I sell Blue Joker ($2), I'd have $4 - still not enough.\nIf I sell Shoot the Moon ($2), I'd have $4 - still not enough.\nIf I sell Troubadour ($3), I'd have $5 - enough for Wrathful Joker!\nIf I sell Card Sharp ($3), I'd have $5 - but Card Sharp is my engine!\n\nWould Wrathful Joker be better than keeping my current setup? I need to think about whether the extra damage is worth losing a key card.\n\nTroubadour gives me 7 cards per hand instead of 5, which is crucial for finding pairs and maintaining flexibility. Wrathful Joker would add +3 Mult per Spade scored—so a Two Pair with 2 Spades becomes +6 Mult, multiplied by Card Sharp's X3 for +18 total. That's solid damage, but it doesn't replace the consistency that extra hand size provides. I'd be sacrificing my ability to reliably construct strong hands for a damage boost that's less reliable.\n\nI should stick with my current deck and face the Boss Blind as is.","action":"\"round_select\""}
