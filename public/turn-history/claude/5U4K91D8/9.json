{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $0\n- I have Blue Joker (+104 chips)\n- Two Pair is now Level 2: Base Chips 40, Base Mult 3\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Obelisk Joker - $11 (can't afford)\n2. Pluto Planet - $3 (can't afford)\n3. Blank Voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n4. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**What can I do?**\nSince I have $0, I cannot:\n- Buy any cards\n- Buy any vouchers\n- Reroll the shop\n\nMy only option is to proceed to the next phase with `round_select`.\n\nLet me verify the upgraded Two Pair stats are correct:\n- Two Pair went from Level 1 (20 chips, 2 mult) to Level 2 (40 chips, 3 mult)\n- That's +20 chips and +1 mult, which matches what Uranus promised\n\nNow with Blue Joker (+104 chips) and Two Pair Level 2, let me calculate my scoring potential:\n- Two Pair base: 40 chips + 3 mult\n- Example hand (two aces + two 5s + one other card): \n  - Base chips: 40\n  - Card chips: 11 + 11 + 5 + 5 = 32 (only the cards in the two pair count)\n  - Blue Joker: +104\n  - Total chips: 40 + 32 + 104 = 176\n  - Mult: 3\n  - Final score: 176 × 3 = 528 chips per hand\n\nThis is a solid improvement. The Big Blind typically requires around 450 chips in Ante 1, so I should be able to beat it with just one or two hands.\n\n\nWith no funds available, I'll move forward to select the blind.\n\nCommand: round_select","action":"\"round_select\""}
