{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 10\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big (7500 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +86 Chips (43 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand already played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Current Hand (10 cards):**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n3. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n4. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n6. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n7. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n8. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n9. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n10. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n\n**Available Pairs:**\n- Jacks: positions 1, 4, 8 (THREE Jacks! Three of a Kind!)\n- 5s: positions 3, 6 (pair)\n\n**Available Hand Types:**\n- Three of a Kind (Jacks): positions 1, 4, 8\n- Two Pair (Jacks and 5s): positions 1, 4, 8 and 3, 6 - wait, I need to pick only 5 cards total, so it would be positions 1, 4, 3, 6 (but which Jack to leave out?)\n\n\n- Actually, with 3 Jacks and 2 5s, I could play either Three of a Kind with all three Jacks or Two Pair using two Jacks and both 5s.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI've been relying on Two Pair at Level 4 with Card Sharp's X3 multiplier when repeating hands. Let me compare the chip output: Three of a Kind with three Jacks gives base 30 chips and 3x multiplier, while the cards themselves contribute 10 + 10 + 10 from the Jacks, plus Blue Joker adds 86 chips.\n\nThat totals 146 chips × 3 = 438 chips—not sufficient. Two Pair at Level 4 is stronger with base 80 chips and 5x multiplier, the four cards add 30 chips, Blue Joker contributes 86, reaching 196 chips × 5 before any Card Sharp multiplication applies on subsequent plays.\n\nOnce Card Sharp triggers after the first hand, repeating Two Pair yields 196 × 15 = roughly 2,940 chips per play. Running this strategy across three hands produces approximately 980 chips initially, then 2,940 twice more, totaling around 6,860 chips.\n\nThat falls short of the 7,500 target. I need to leverage my discards strategically—cycling through cards to either strengthen existing pairs or unlock a more valuable hand. With four discards at my disposal, I can swap out the unpaired cards (7♠, 8♥, 2♥, Q♦, 9♦) while preserving my Jacks and 5s, hoping Space Joker or fresh draws improve my position.\n\nBefore committing to discards, I should map out what's still available in the deck. I've already drawn three Jacks when only one remains, and I'm holding both 5s. The remaining cards—6s, 4s, 3s, Kings, Aces, 10s—are more plentiful, giving me better odds of completing additional pairs or hitting stronger combinations through the draw.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,5,7,9,10]"}
