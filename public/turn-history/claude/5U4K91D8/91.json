{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Current Blind: Big Blind\n- Chips Needed: 16,500\n- Current Chips: 4,018\n- Remaining chips needed: 16,500 - 4,018 = 12,482\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n2. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n4. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n5. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n6. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n7. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n9. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n10. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +58 Chips (29 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Showman\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice this round\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult) - Played 7 times THIS GAME, but only 1 time THIS ROUND\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n\n**Available Hands:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Two Jacks: Jack of Hearts (2), Jack of Diamonds (7) = PAIR\n- Two 3s: 3 of Spades (1), 3 of Diamonds (10) = PAIR\n\n\n- Two 7s: 7 of Hearts (3), 7 of Diamonds (8) = PAIR\n\nWith three pairs available, I can form Two Pair. A Full House isn't possible since I lack three of a kind.\n\n**Two Pair Calculation:**\nPlaying Jacks and 7s gives me the highest card values: 80 base chips plus 34 from the four cards (10 + 10 + 7 + 7), and the Blue Joker adds 58 more for a strong total.\n\nEven accounting for the multiplier and Card Sharp's X3 boost on a second play—which would yield 860 chips initially, then 2,580 on the replay for 3,440 combined—this falls short of the 12,482 chips I need.\n\nI need to pursue a Full House instead, which requires three of a kind plus a pair. Looking at remaining deck options, I have two Jacks in hand with two more available, and three 3s still in play.\n\nWith 5 cards out of 29 remaining that could complete a Full House, discarding my current hand to draw 5 fresh cards gives me roughly a 58% success rate. Now I'm considering which cards to keep and which to discard to maximize my chances.\n\nI should hold onto two pairs rather than three of a kind. Keeping the Jacks and 7s seems strongest since they're higher ranked, which means discarding the 3 of Spades, 6 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, and 5 of Diamonds. Though I could potentially keep the 3s instead if that offers better value.\n\nActually, holding three pairs gives me multiple paths to a full house—drawing another Jack, 7, or 3 would complete it. But I'm limited to keeping exactly 5 cards, so I need to commit to which two pairs maximize my odds.\n\nThe Jacks and 7s are my strongest option since they're higher ranked. I'll keep both pairs and one kicker, discarding the 3s, 6, 8, Ace, and 5.\n\nWait—let me verify my actual hand first. I have two Jacks, two 7s, and two 3s. If I keep just the Jacks and 7s, I'm discarding the 3 of Spades along with the other low cards.\n\nActually, keeping the two Jacks gives me the best shot at a Full House or three of a kind. I'll discard the 3 of Spades, 6 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, and 5 of Diamonds—holding onto the Jack of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds, and 7 of Diamonds.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,9,1]"}
