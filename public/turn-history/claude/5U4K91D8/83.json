{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $12\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +2 Chips per remaining card in deck (Currently +106 Chips)\n2. Showman - Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. To Do List (Joker) - Earn $4 if poker hand is a Pair, hand changes at end of round - $4\n2. Mercury (Planet) - Level up Pair +1 Mult and +15 chips - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Playing cards - $6\n2. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Seed Money - Raise interest cap to $10 - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 5 (140 chips, 12 mult) - my main hand, played 6 times\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult) - played 13 times\n- Pair: Level 1 (10 chips, 2 mult) - played 0 times\n- Everything else is Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm entering Ante 5 now, which means the chip requirements will be significantly higher. Looking at my strategy so far:\n- I've been primarily playing Full House (6 times) at Level 5\n\n\n- Two Pair has been my secondary hand (13 times) at Level 4\n- My joker setup relies heavily on Card Sharp for the X3 multiplier when repeating hands\n- Blue Joker gives me a flat chip boost based on deck size\n\nThe shop offerings present some interesting options. To Do List would generate $4 whenever I play a Pair, though Pair is currently Level 1 and underdeveloped. Mercury could strengthen Pair by leveling it up, but I'd need to actually play it to make use of that investment. The Jumbo and Celestial packs offer ways to improve my deck composition, while Seed Money would boost my economy long-term.\n\nSince I'm heading into Ante 5 with tougher chip requirements, I need to decide whether to double down on my Full House strategy with Card Sharp or explore other directions. The Celestial Pack stands out because finding a planet that levels Full House would directly strengthen my primary hand.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my joker slots are maxed at 5/5, and Troubadour is becoming a liability as rounds progress. A reroll might surface better jokers, though that's riskier than a guaranteed planet upgrade. The Jumbo Standard Pack could help me assemble Full Houses more consistently by adding another card to my deck.\n\nUltimately, buying the Celestial Pack for $4 seems like the strongest play—I can upgrade Full House or Two Pair to scale my scoring, leaving me with $8 for future rounds.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
