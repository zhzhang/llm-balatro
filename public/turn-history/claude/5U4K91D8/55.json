{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $8\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (53 cards remaining × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Saturn (Planet) - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips. Cost: $3\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains Three of a Kind. Cost: $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack (Tarot) - Cost: $4\n2. Buffoon Pack (Joker) - Cost: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarots appear 2X more frequently. Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (my main hand, played 10 times)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1 (just played once)\n- Most other hands: Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm now at Ante 4, which means the chip requirements will start getting significantly higher. Looking at my strategy so far:\n- I've been heavily relying on Two Pair (Level 4), which has been working well\n- Blue Joker has been a consistent chip source\n- Card Sharp has been excellent for multiplying my score when playing the same hand twice\n- Troubadour gives me extra hand size but costs me 1 hand per round\n- Shoot the Moon hasn't been useful recently due to the boss debuff on face cards\n\n\n- With $8 available, I need to decide between upgrading existing hands, adding new jokers, or exploring tarot options. Saturn could strengthen Straights but I haven't prioritized them. Zany Joker offers multiplier potential for Three of a Kind plays. The booster packs might provide better long-term value than single card purchases, though a reroll could reveal stronger options.\n\nMy Two Pair strategy with Card Sharp has been solid so far, but higher Antes will demand additional scoring power. Buffoon Pack appeals since Shoot the Moon hasn't delivered much value, especially against boss blinds that penalize face cards. Arcana Pack could unlock deck manipulation through tarot cards, which might be more impactful than the joker options I'm currently considering.\n\nWith $8 available, buying Buffoon Pack for $4 leaves me with enough cushion to adapt later. Rerolling would cost $5 and risk showing worse options. I'll go with the Buffoon Pack—upgrading my joker lineup is essential for tackling tougher rounds.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
