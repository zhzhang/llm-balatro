{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 7 (about to face Boss Blind)\n- Current Money: $6\n- All 5 joker slots filled\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 Chips\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Duplicates allowed in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Wrathful Joker: +3 Mult per Spade card when scored - $5\n- Joker Stencil: X1 Mult per empty joker slot (currently X0 since all slots full) - $8\n- Standard Pack x2: $4 each\n- Director's Cut (Voucher): Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante, $10 per roll - $10\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy Two Pair strategy has been very effective. I'm averaging very high chip counts with the Card Sharp combo. Looking at the shop:\n\n1. **Wrathful Joker ($5)**: This gives +3 Mult per Spade card scored. My deck has Spades in it, but I'd need to sell a joker to make room. Let me think about which joker I could sell:\n   - Blue Joker: Currently +104 chips - very valuable\n   - Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held - valuable when I have Queens\n   - Showman: Allows duplicates in shop - not directly affecting scoring but potentially useful\n   - Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round - very useful for having more options\n   - Card Sharp: X3 Mult on second Two Pair play - this is my main engine\n   \nIf I sell Showman for $2, I'd reach $8 total and could grab Wrathful Joker for $5, leaving me with $3. Since Showman doesn't directly contribute to scoring, the Spade multiplier might be a worthwhile trade if I'm regularly playing Spades.\n\n2. **Joker Stencil ($8)**: Needs empty slots to function, so it's not viable currently.\n\n3. **Standard Packs ($4 each)**: Could strengthen my deck but my budget is tight.\n\n4. **Director's Cut ($10)**: Beyond my current means.\n\n5. **Reroll ($6)**: Would deplete my entire bankroll just for a chance at alternatives.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nThe Boss Blind ahead has unique mechanics I need to prepare for. My Two Pair strategy has been performing well so far. I'm weighing whether to preserve cash for future shops, invest $4 in a Standard Pack for potential card improvements, trade Showman to afford Wrathful Joker, or spend everything on a reroll. Given my strong track record with Two Pair plays, I should consider what best supports that approach going into the boss encounter.\n\nThe Standard Pack seems like the safer choice—it costs $4, leaves me with $2 cushion, and gives me three card options that could strengthen my hand for the upcoming challenge. Wrathful Joker might help with Spades but isn't a guaranteed upgrade. Showman's ability to duplicate cards has real value for finding synergies later. I'm leaning toward the Standard Pack purchase.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
