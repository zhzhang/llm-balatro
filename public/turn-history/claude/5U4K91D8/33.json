{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 5\n- Game Step: TAROT_PACK (choosing from Arcana Pack)\n- Current Money: $6\n- I have 4 jokers equipped\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +84 chips (currently, based on cards in deck)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. The Wheel of Fortune - 1 in 4 chance to add Foil/Holographic/Polychrome edition to a random Joker\n2. The Wheel of Fortune (duplicate) - Same as above\n3. The Tower - Enhances 1 selected card into a Stone Card (+50 Chips, no rank or suit)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades\n2. Queen of Hearts\n3. Jack of Hearts\n4. 3 of Hearts\n5. 9 of Clubs\n6. 8 of Clubs\n7. 2 of Clubs\n8. Ace of Diamonds\n9. 10 of Diamonds\n10. 6 of Diamonds\n\n**Strategy:**\nI'm playing exclusively Two Pair at Level 3 (60 base chips, 4 base mult). My recent scores have been around 2,890-3,060 chips.\n\n**Evaluating the Tarot Options:**\n\n1. **The Wheel of Fortune (options 1 & 2):** \n   - 1 in 4 chance to add an edition to a random joker\n   - Editions provide: Foil (+50 chips), Holographic (+10 Mult), or Polychrome (x1.5 Mult)\n   - The Wheel is risky with only a 25% success rate, but if it lands, I could get significant value—Holographic on Blue Joker adds multiplier to its chip bonus, or Polychrome on Shoot the Moon multiplies its Queen-based mult by 1.5x. The downside is the effect applies randomly to whichever joker gets selected.\n\n2. **The Tower:**\n   - Enhances 1 selected card into a Stone Card\n   - Stone Card: +50 Chips, but loses rank and suit\n   - This is a guaranteed effect\n   - Stone cards still contribute their +50 chips when played\n\n, however, they lose their rank, so they CAN'T form pairs or other hand types\n   - This is actually BAD for my Two Pair strategy because the card becomes useless for forming pairs\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Tower is a trap for my strategy. Converting a card to Stone means it can't participate in forming Two Pairs anymore, which is my entire strategy. While it gives +50 chips, that's only valuable if the card is played AND contributes to the hand type. Since Stone cards have no rank, they can't form pairs.\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune is a gamble but has upside potential:\n- 25% chance to succeed\n- If it succeeds, I get a permanent edition on one of my jokers\n- Polychrome (x1.5 mult) would be the best outcome\n- Holographic (+10 mult) would also be good\n- Foil (+50 chips) woul\n\nd be okay\n\nGiven that I'm already comfortably beating blinds and don't need immediate power, the Tower would actively sabotage my pairing strategy. The Wheel of Fortune offers genuine upside with no downside if it fails—I'll go with option 1 since they're identical anyway.\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune is the clear winner here. Even at just 25% success, the chance at a permanent joker upgrade beats guaranteed chip gains that would cripple my hand-forming ability.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
