{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Current Blind: Big Blind\n- Chips Needed: 16,500\n- Current Chips: 4,018\n- Remaining chips needed: 16,500 - 4,018 = 12,482\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 1\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n2. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n4. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n5. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n7. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n9. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +48 Chips (24 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Showman\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice this round (IMPORTANT!)\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult) - Played 7 times total, 1 time THIS ROUND\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n\n**Available Hands in Current Hand:**\nLooking at my cards:\n- Two Jacks: Jack of Hearts (2), Jack of Diamonds (7) = PAIR\n\n\n- Three 7s: 7 of Hearts (3), 7 of Clubs (6), 7 of Diamonds (8) = THREE OF A KIND!\n\nI can combine these into a full house with the three 7s and two Jacks. Since I already played a full house this round, Card Sharp triggers with X3 mult on this play. The base full house gives 165 chips, and the card values total 41 chips (7+7+7+10+10).\n\nAdding the Blue Joker's +48 chips brings me to 254 total chips. With a base mult of 14 multiplied by Card Sharp's X3, I get 42 mult, resulting in 10,668 chips this hand. Combined with my current 4,018, that reaches 14,686—still about 1,814 short of 16,500. I have 2 hands left to work with, so I need to evaluate whether this play gets me closer to the goal or if I should explore other options.\n\nPlaying the Full House now would leave me needing just 1,814 more chips on my final hand after drawing 5 new cards. Alternatively, I could use my remaining discard to try setting up a stronger position, though I'm limited to just one more discard and already have a decent hand in front of me.\n\nOption 1 seems more reliable—play the Full House with Card Sharp active to get roughly 10,668 chips, then rely on whatever I draw for the last hand. Let me verify the scoring: the three 7s and two Jacks contribute their base values, the Blue Joker adds to the total, and Card Sharp triples the multiplier on top of the Full House's base 165 chips and 14x multiplier.\n\nI'll select the Jack of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, and 7 of Diamonds to form the Full House.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,6,7,8]"}
