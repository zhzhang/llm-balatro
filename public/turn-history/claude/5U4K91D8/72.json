{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 10\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $10\n- Next blind will be the Boss Blind (Round 10 is after Big, so next is Boss)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (currently 53 cards in deck)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Sly Joker: +50 Chips if played hand contains a Pair - $3\n- Saturn (Planet): Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips - $3\n- Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n- Mega Celestial Pack: Choose 2 of up to 5 Planet cards - $8\n- Tarot Merchant Voucher: Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently - $10\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 3 (90 base chips, 8 base mult) - played 4 times\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 base chips, 5 base mult) - played 13 times\n- Other hands are mostly Level 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance, I've been heavily relying on Full House and Two Pair hands. My strategy has been working well with Card Sharp's X3 multiplier when I repeat hands.\n\nFor the upcoming Boss Blind (Ante 4), I need to prepare for higher chip requirements. Let me consider my options:\n\n1. **Sly Joker** ($3): Adds +50 chips if the hand contains a Pair. This would stack with Blue Joker and could be useful since most of my hands (Two Pair, Full House) contain pairs. This is a solid purchase.\n\n\n2. **Saturn** ($3): Levels up Straight, but I haven't played any Straights yet, so this doesn't fit my current approach. **Arcana Pack** ($4) could give me useful Tarot effects, though it's unpredictable. **Mega Celestial Pack** ($8) would let me level up my two strongest hands—Full House and Two Pair—which could substantially increase my scoring. **Tarot Merchant** ($10) would make Tarot cards appear twice as often, but that uses my entire budget and doesn't directly boost my current hands.\n\nLooking at my options with $10: I could grab Sly Joker and Arcana Pack for $7, leaving $3 for the next shop. Or I could spend $8 on the Mega Celestial Pack to strengthen my best hands, keeping $2 in reserve. The Sly Joker is solid for my pair-focused strategy, while the Mega Celestial Pack offers more immediate power but leaves me with minimal flexibility.\n\nMy Full House and Two Pair hands show high variance—Full House ranges from 1,086 to 4,800 chips, Two Pair from 1,040 to 8,640. Leveling them up would smooth out that inconsistency. But I'm already at my joker limit, so I'd need to sell something first if I want Sly Joker.\n\nLooking at what I have: Blue Joker's chip boost is solid, Card Sharp anchors my repeat strategy, Troubadour's hand size increase matters, and Showman's card multiplication is useful. Space Joker has room to grow too. The Mega Celestial Pack still feels like the strongest play—upgrading Full House and Two Pair directly addresses my consistency problem, and that's worth the $8 investment.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
