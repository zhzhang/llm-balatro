{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 14\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $4\n- At the Big Blind decision point\n\n**Big Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 30,000\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Polychrome Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n\n**Upcoming Boss Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 40,000\n- Boss Effect: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips\n2. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n3. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n4. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n5. Flower Pot - X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 9, Base Chips 240, Base Mult 20\n\n**Expected Scoring:**\n\nLet me calculate what I can achieve with my current setup:\n\nFirst Full House (with all 4 suits present):\n- Base chips: 240\n- Card chips: approximately 50 (5 cards in a full house, averaging ~10 chips each)\n- Blue Joker: +106\n- Total chips: ~396\n\n- Base mult: 20\n- Flower Pot: X3 = 60 mult\n- Final score: 396 × 60 = 23,760 chips\n\nSecond Full House (with all 4 suits, Card Sharp active):\n- Total chips: ~396\n- Base mult: 20\n- Card Sharp: X3 = 60 mult\n- Flower Pot: X3 = 180 mult total\n- Final score: 396 × 180 = 71,280 chips\n\n\n- Combined total: 95,040 chips—well above the 30,000 threshold.\n\nNow, should I take the Polychrome Tag instead? A free Polychrome Joker with X1.5 mult is tempting, but skipping means forfeiting the $4 reward, the shop visit, and any interest gains. I'd jump straight to the Boss Blind without restocking.\n\nThe tag's effectiveness is also limited since it only applies to base edition jokers that appear in the shop. Given how much I need the money and the chance to upgrade before facing the Boss with its Diamond debuff, playing through Big Blind makes more sense than banking on a random Polychrome joker.","action":"\"play_round\""}
