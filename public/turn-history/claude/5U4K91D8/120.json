{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 14 (just beat Small Blind)\n- Money: $4\n- In SHOP phase\n- No consumables currently\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: Will need approximately 30,000 chips\n- Boss Blind: Will need approximately 40,000 chips (and all Diamond cards are debuffed)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (53 cards in deck)\n2. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n3. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n4. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n5. Flower Pot - X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 9, Base Chips 240, Base Mult 20\n\n**Shop:**\n- The Emperor: $3 - Creates up to 2 random Tarot cards\n- Standard Pack: $4 each (2 available)\n- Paint Brush voucher: $10 (+1 hand size)\n- Reroll: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just used Earth to level up Full House to Level 9. Now I need to decide what to do with my remaining $4.\n\nLet me calculate my expected scoring for upcoming blinds:\n\nWith Level 9 Full House:\nFirst Full House (with all 4 suits):\n- Base chips: 240\n- Card chips: ~50 (average for 5 cards)\n- Blue Joker: +106\n- Total: ~396 chips\n- Base mult: 20\n- Flower Pot: X3 = 60 mult\n- Score: 396 × 60 = 23,760 chips\n\nSecond Full House (with all 4 suits, Card Sharp active):\n\n\n- Chips remain ~396\n- Base mult: 20\n- Card Sharp multiplier stacks with Flower Pot for X3 × X3 = X9 total = 180 mult\n- Score: 396 × 180 = 71,280 chips\n\nCombined scoring reaches 95,040 chips—well above the Big Blind threshold and solid for the Boss Blind. The Card Sharp synergy with Flower Pot creates exceptional scaling when I repeat the same hand. I should focus on whether to invest my $4 in The Emperor for potential Tarot generation or a Standard Pack for deck consistency.\n\nThe Emperor's random Tarots feel risky given my current momentum, and Standard Packs would likely dilute my 53-card deck that's already performing optimally with Blue Joker providing +106 chips. My Full House strategy is proven and generating strong results, so advancing to the next round preserves my $4 for a more targeted purchase after Big Blind. Tarots could enhance my key cards, thin my deck, or add editions and seals, but the randomness is risky—I might waste $3 on something useless. Since my Full House strategy is already strong and I'm positioned well for the next two blinds, I'll skip the purchase and keep my $4 for better opportunities ahead.","action":"\"round_select\""}
