{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6 (in shop after Small Blind)\n- Current Money: $2\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 5, at capacity)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (52 cards in deck × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Allows duplicates in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand already played this round (recently bought)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Even Steven (Common, $4): +4 Mult per even-ranked card scored\n- Mega Standard Pack ($8): Choose 2 of 5 Playing cards\n- Director's Cut ($10): Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Recent Changes:**\n- Just bought Card Sharp for $6\n- Just bought and used Celestial Pack for $4 (selected Uranus to level up Two Pair)\n- Two Pair is now Level 4: Base Chips 80, Base Mult 5 (up from Level 3)\n\n**Current Situation:**\nI only have $2 left, which is not enough to:\n- Buy Even Steven ($4)\n- Buy Mega Standard Pack ($8)\n- Buy Director's Cut ($10)\n- Reroll shop ($5)\n\nI have no meaningful actions I can take with $2. All shop items cost more than I have.\n\n**What I Should Do:**\nSince I can't afford anything in the shop and have already made my key purchases (Card Sharp and leveled up Two Pair), the best action is to proceed to the next phase. I should use `round_select` to finish shopping and move on to the blind select phase.\n\n\n---\n\nMy build is in good shape heading into the Big Blind—Card Sharp's X3 multiplier will amplify Two Pair plays significantly, and the Level 4 upgrade gives me better base values. With my current joker synergies and the chip boost from Blue Joker, I'm positioned well for the higher blind requirements coming up.","action":"\"round_select\""}
