{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 5\n- In the SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $10\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 4, so 1 slot available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (currently have 0, so 2 slots available)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (52 cards × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size (8 cards instead of 6), -1 hand each round\n\n**Shop Contents After Reroll:**\n- Jupiter (Planet) - $3 - Levels up Flush (+2 mult, +15 chips) - NOT useful for my Two Pair strategy\n- Bull (Uncommon Joker) - $6 - +2 chips for each $1 you have (Currently +20 chips)\n- Arcana Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards\n- Standard Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Playing cards\n- Director's Cut (Voucher) - $10 - Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nI'm playing exclusively Two Pair (Level 3: 60 base chips, 4 base mult). My recent scores:\n- Ante 2 Boss (1600 needed): 2,890 chips\n- Ante 2 Small: 3,060 chips\n\nEntering Ante 3, chip requirements will increase significantly. Typical scaling:\n- Ante 3 Small Blind: ~900 chips\n\n\n- Ante 3 Big Blind: ~1400 chips  \n- Ante 3 Boss Blind: ~2400 chips\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\nBull's +20 chips is minimal compared to my Blue Joker's +104 chips and won't scale effectively. Jupiter doesn't help my Two Pair focus. The Arcana Pack could unlock useful enhancements like Mult Cards or Glass cards that would strengthen my hand composition.\n\nStandard Pack just adds basic cards to the deck, which isn't a priority right now. Director's Cut costs exactly what I have and would let me reroll the boss blind once per ante—valuable insurance as I push toward Ante 8. Alternatively, I could spend $6 on another reroll and have $4 remaining to hunt for a Two Pair planet card or better joker options.\n\nSince the last reroll didn't yield a Two Pair planet card, I'm weighing whether to invest in card enhancements through the Arcana Pack, secure long-term flexibility with Director's Cut, or take another shot at finding the specific upgrades I need. Lucky Cards offer a 1/5 chance for +20 mult, and Bonus Cards give +30 chips when scored. These enhancements could meaningfully amplify my Two Pair scoring, especially on frequently played cards like face cards.\n\nRerolling for $6 might land a Two Pair planet, but it's uncertain and leaves me with minimal funds afterward. Director's Cut would drain my entire budget without directly improving my current strong position. The Arcana Pack at $4 is the better play—it provides immediate card upgrades while preserving $6 for flexibility, and persistent enhancements compound throughout the run.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
