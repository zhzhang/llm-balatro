{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Boss Blind: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n3. Queen of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips, Gold Card enhancement)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. Queen of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n9. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n10. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +86 Chips (currently)\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice in round\n5. Astronomer - Makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs FREE\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 7 (190 chips, 16 mult) - My main hand\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have 10 cards in hand (thanks to Troubadour's +2 hand size).\n\nLooking for possible hands:\n- Three Queens: Queen of Hearts (debuffed), Queen of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds - this would form three of a kind\n- Actually, I need to think about Full House specifically\n\nFor a Full House, I need:\n- Three of a kind + a pair\n\n\n- Three Queens are available (Hearts debuffed, Clubs, Diamonds), but even though the Heart Queen won't contribute chips, it still counts toward the hand type. However, I don't see any pairs in the remaining cards, so a Full House isn't possible. Three of a Kind with the three Queens is my best option here—the base hand scores 90 chips with 9 mult at Level 4, plus the card values from the Queens themselves.\n\nLooking at the scoring: the Clubs and Diamonds Queens each add 10 chips, while the Hearts Queen contributes nothing due to the debuff. The Blue Joker adds 86 chips, bringing the total to 196 chips. Multiplied by 9, that's 1,764 chips for this hand.\n\nSince this is my opening play, Card Sharp won't trigger yet—it requires the same hand type twice. I could instead discard and search for better cards to build toward Full House plays, which would leverage my Level 7 Full House and the Card Sharp synergy. I'd need to find either pairs or additional three-of-a-kinds to make that work.\n\nI have three Queens already, so landing a pair would complete a Full House immediately. I'll discard the 10 of Spades, 2 of Spades, 9 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 3 of Clubs—keeping the three Queens plus the Jack and 7 of Diamonds. Drawing five fresh cards gives me a solid chance at hitting that pair.\n\nTo reach the 22,000 chip target, I need to think about scoring potential. My previous Full House hands ranged from around 3,000 to 12,700 chips, with the higher scores likely coming when Card Sharp was active for a 3x multiplier. If I can land two strong Full House hands with the second one benefiting from that multiplier, I should cross the threshold.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,6,7]"}
