{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 7\n- Current Blind: Big Blind\n- Chips Needed: 3000\n- Current Chips: 960 (need 2040 more)\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n2. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n5. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n6. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips) - GOLD CARD (pays $3 if held at end of round)\n7. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n9. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +66 chips (33 cards remaining × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Duplicates allowed in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round (TWO PAIR has been played!)\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of 5s: positions 5, 9\n- Pair of 2s: positions 7, 10\n- Hearts Flush: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (4 cards - not a flush)\n- No Two Pair available\n- No other pairs\n\nSince I already played Two Pair, Card Sharp is active and will give me X3 Mult if I play the same hand type again (Two Pair).\n\n\nI can form Two Pair using the 5s at positions 5 and 9, plus the 2s at positions 7 and 10. This triggers Card Sharp's X3 Mult bonus since Two Pair was already played. The base chips from a Level 4 Two Pair is 80, plus 14 from the cards themselves (5+2+5+2), and the Blue Joker adds another 66 chips on top.\n\nFor multiplier, the base is 5, and Shoot the Moon grants +13 from the Queen of Clubs in my hand, bringing it to 18. After applying Card Sharp's X3 multiplier, that becomes 54. The final calculation is 160 chips × 54 multiplier = 8,640 chips, which far exceeds the 2,040 needed to win. I should play these four cards.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [5,7,9,10]"}
