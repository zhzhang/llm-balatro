{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11 (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Boss Effect: Decrease level of played poker hand\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n4. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n5. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n9. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +76 Chips (currently)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Analysis of Available Hands:**\n- Two pairs of Aces: positions 1, 3\n- Two pairs of Kings: positions 2, 7\n- I have 5 Diamonds: 7, 8, 9, 10 (King, Jack, 7, 2)\n\nPossible hands:\n1. **Two Pair**: Aces and Kings (positions 1, 3, 2, 7) - This is the best two pair I can make\n2. **Flush**: I only have 4 Diamonds, not enough for a flush\n\n\n3. **Full House**: I can't form one with just two Aces and two Kings. I'd need three of a kind plus a pair. With only 2 Kings and 2 Aces remaining in the deck, I could potentially draw another to complete a Full House, but with 3 discards and 3 hands left, I need to plan carefully.\n\nNow I should calculate what Two Pair (Aces and Kings) will yield me.\n\n**First Two Pair play:**\n- Base chips: 80 (Level 4)\n- Card chips: 11 + 11 + 10 + 10 = 42\n- Blue Joker: +76\n- Total chips: 80 + 42 + 76 = 198\n- Base mult: 5\n- Card Sharp doesn't activate (first play)\n- Total: 198 × 5 = 990 chips\n\nAfter this play, Two Pair will drop to Level 3 due to boss effect.\n\n**Second Two Pair play (at Level 3):**\n- Base chips: 55 (Level 3)\n- Card chips: 42\n- Blue Joker: ~70 (assuming some cards were drawn)\n- Total chips: ~167\n- Base mult: 4 × 3 (Card Sharp) = 12\n- Total: 167 × 12 = 2,004 chips\n\nCombined: 990 + 2,004 = 2,994 chips - Still not enough!\n\nI need a different approach. Discarding low-value cards to chase a Full House seems more promising. If I keep both Aces and both Kings, I can discard the remaining cards and hope to draw a third matching card to form a Full House, which would give me significantly more chips.\n\nI'll keep the Ace of Spades, King of Spades, Ace of Hearts, and King of Diamonds. Since I can only discard 5 cards, I'll remove the 6 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, and 7 of Diamonds.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,8,9]"}
