{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6 (just beat Small Blind)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $12\n- Blue Joker is at +104 chips (52 cards in deck)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 chips\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Even Steven (Common, $4): Played cards with even rank give +4 Mult when scored\n2. Card Sharp (Uncommon, $6): X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\nBoosters:\n1. Celestial Pack ($4): Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n2. Mega Standard Pack ($8): Choose 2 of up to 5 Playing cards\n\nVouchers:\n1. Director's Cut ($10): Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $12 available. Looking at my recent performance:\n- Just played Full House for 2,584 chips (Small Blind, needed 2000)\n- My strategy has been playing Two Pair (Level 3), which has been working well\n\nMy current build relies on:\n1. Blue Joker for chip bonuses based on deck size\n2. Shoot the Moon for mult when holding Queens\n3. Two Pair as my primary hand type (Level 3)\n\n**Evaluating Shop Options:**\n\n1. **Even Steven ($4)**: This could be useful since many cards are even (10, 8, 6, 4, 2). If I play 4 even cards, that's +16 Mult. However, my strategy doesn't specifically target even cards.\n\n\n2. **Card Sharp ($6)**: This stands out—playing Two Pair twice in a round would trigger X3 Mult on the second play, potentially tripling my scoring. That's a significant multiplier boost for my main hand.\n3. **Celestial Pack ($4)**: Could advance Two Pair beyond Level 3 or unlock another hand type, though incremental leveling might not be as impactful as a strong joker synergy.\n4. **Mega Standard Pack ($8)**: Adding more cards increases my Blue Joker bonus but also dilutes my hand composition, making it harder to consistently hit my target hands.\n\nCard Sharp appears to be the optimal choice. Since I frequently cycle through Two Pair multiple times per round, the X3 Mult multiplier on repeated plays would substantially amplify my chip output. With $12 available, I could grab Card Sharp for $6 and either invest the remaining $6 into Celestial Pack for additional leveling, or hold it for future shops. The math is compelling—if a standard Two Pair scores 2,500 chips, Card Sharp would push the second play to 7,500 chips.\n\nGiven the Big Blind and Boss Blind approaching, Card Sharp becomes critical for surviving those high-difficulty rounds. I'll prioritize purchasing it now.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [2]"}
