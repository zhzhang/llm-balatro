{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: PLANET_PACK (I need to choose one of three planet cards)\n- Current Money: $7\n- I just opened a Celestial Pack (Planet pack)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Neptune - Level up Straight Flush (+4 Mult, +40 chips) - Currently Level 1\n2. Earth - Level up Full House (+2 Mult, +25 chips) - Currently Level 7\n3. Saturn - Level up Straight (+3 Mult, +30 chips) - Currently Level 1\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 7, Base Chips 190, Base Mult 16, Times Played 12\n- Straight Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 100, Base Mult 8, Times Played 0\n- Straight: Level 1, Base Chips 30, Base Mult 4, Times Played 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent play history, I've been exclusively playing Full House hands, and it's been my primary strategy:\n- Last 7 hands were all Full Houses\n- Full House is already at Level 7 (190 base chips, 16 base mult)\n- I've played Full House 12 times total\n\nThe question is: should I continue leveling up Full House (my proven strategy), or should I invest in a different hand type?\n\n**Option 1: Earth (Level up Full House)**\n- Would take Full House from Level 7 to Level 8\n- Gains: +2 Mult (16 → 18), +25 chips (190 → 215)\n- This is the safe choice - doubling down on what's working\n- With my Blue Joker (+106 chips) and Card Sharp (x3 on repeated plays), Full Houses have been scoring 4,000-14,940 chips\n\n\n- Ante 6 will demand significantly higher scores, so incremental improvements to my reliable hand matter\n\n**Option 2: Neptune (Level up Straight Flush)**\n- Would take Straight Flush from Level 1 to Level 2\n- Gains: +4 Mult (8 → 12), +40 chips (100 → 140)\n- Straight Flush is difficult to assemble - needs 5 consecutive cards all matching suit\n- Troubadour gives me +2 hand size for 10-card draws, but I haven't successfully played a Straight Flush yet\n- This represents a significant strategic shift with uncertain payoff\n\n**Option 3: Saturn (Level up Straight)**\n- Would take Straight from Level 1 to Level 2\n- Gains: +3 Mult (4 → 7), +30 chips (30 → 60)\n- Straights form more readily than Straight Flushes, though still haven't played one this run\n- Base values are substantially lower than Full House regardless\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'm going with **Earth (Full House)**. My current approach has already proven itself against Ante 5's Boss Blind, and my jokers align perfectly with this strategy - Blue Joker provides consistent chip scaling while Card Sharp multiplies my damage. Switching to an untested hand type now introduces unnecessary risk when my existing system is performing well.\n\nLeveling Full House to 8 gives meaningful stat improvements that compound with my other effects, and the hand itself remains straightforward to assemble with my current draw size. Pivoting to Straight or Straight Flush would mean starting from scratch with higher chip requirements looming in Ante 6.\n\nI'll select position 2 (Earth) to upgrade Full House.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
