{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 9\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $5\n- I just successfully beat the Small Blind\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (based on remaining cards)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Flash Card (Joker): Gains +2 Mult per reroll in shop - Cost: $5\n2. Jupiter (Planet): Level up Flush, +2 Mult and +15 chips - Cost: $3\n3. Standard Pack (Booster): Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - Cost: $4\n4. Jumbo Celestial Pack (Booster): Choose 1 of 5 Planet cards - Cost: $6\n5. Tarot Merchant (Voucher): Tarot cards appear 2X more - Cost: $10\n6. Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Level Analysis:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (my main hand, 80 base chips, 5 base mult) - played 13 times\n- All other hands are Level 1\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance, I've been heavily relying on Two Pair with Card Sharp for the X3 multiplier. This has been working well. I'm at Ante 4/8, so I have 4 more Antes to get through.\n\nMy options with $5:\n1. Buy Flash Card ($5) - but I'm at max jokers (5/5), so I'd need to sell one first\n\n\n2. Buy Jupiter ($3) - levels up Flush, but I haven't been using Flush\n3. Buy Standard Pack ($4) - add a playing card\n4. Reroll the shop ($5) - see what else is available\n\nFlash Card is tempting since it gains +2 Mult per reroll, but I'd need to sacrifice a joker. My Blue Joker is too valuable at 106 chips, Showman synergizes well with my current setup, Troubadour gives me card advantage, and Card Sharp is essential for my Two Pair strategy. Space Joker's upgrade chance is also useful for scaling my hands.\n\nNone of my jokers are worth trading away for Flash Card's slow buildup. Jupiter would help Flush, but I'm not playing those hands. Standard Pack adds a card for $4, leaving me with $1. Jumbo Celestial Pack needs $6 and I only have $5.\n\nMy strongest option is either buying Jupiter to preserve cash for the next shop, skipping this round to earn more money before the next blind, or rerolling to find something that actually synergizes with my Two Pair focus.\n\nSince Two Pair is already Level 4 and performing well, I don't need to rush into purchases. I'll move forward to the next blind—earning more money will give me better flexibility than spending $5 on something marginal.","action":"\"round_select\""}
