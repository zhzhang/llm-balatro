{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Just finished the Big Blind\n- Current Money: $13\n- In the SHOP phase\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (currently +106 based on deck size)\n2. Showman - Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Astronomer - All Planet cards and Celestial Packs in the shop are free ($8)\n2. Square Joker - +4 Chips per 4-card hand ($4)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Planet cards ($6)\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Playing cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Seed Money - Raise interest cap to $10 ($10)\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent performance:\n- Full House is my primary winning hand (Level 7 now, 190 base chips, 16 base mult)\n- I've played it 9 times total\n- Card Sharp has been incredibly valuable - it gives X3 mult when I play the same hand type twice\n- Blue Joker is strong with +106 chips currently\n\n**What should I buy?**\n\n1. **Astronomer ($8)** - This would make Planet cards and Celestial Packs free. I have $13, so I could buy this and then get free planet cards to level up hands. However, I'd need to see if there are planet cards available after buying it, or I'd need to reroll.\n\n\n2. **Square Joker ($4)** - Gives +4 chips only on 4-card hands, but Troubadour's +2 hand size means I'm playing 5-card hands most of the time for Full House. Not a strong fit for my current strategy.\n3. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)** - Could upgrade a hand, but becomes free if I grab Astronomer first, making this a better purchase after.\n4. **Seed Money ($10)** - Doubles my interest cap, but hand leveling feels more impactful right now than banking extra money.\n\nThe clearest path forward is buying Astronomer for $8, leaving me with $5. That makes the Celestial Pack free, so I can immediately level up Full House without spending anything extra. I'd still have $5 remaining after both purchases. This combo gives me the strongest possible hand for the Boss Blind without overextending my budget. My joker slots are maxed at 5/5, so I can't add more without selling existing ones—upgrading my hands is the better investment at this point.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
