{"reasoning":"Looking at the current game state, I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase where I need to select one planet card from the Celestial Pack I just bought.\n\nMy options are:\n1. Earth (lvl.5) - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips\n2. Earth (lvl.5) - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips (duplicate due to Showman)\n3. Uranus (lvl.4) - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips\n\nCurrent hand levels:\n- Full House: Level 5, Base Chips 140, Base Mult 12, Times Played 6\n- Two Pair: Level 4, Base Chips 80, Base Mult 5, Times Played 13\n\nMy strategy has been heavily focused on Full House as my primary scoring hand, which I've played 6 times and is already at Level 5. With my Card Sharp joker giving X3 mult when I play the same hand twice in a round, Full House has been my main winning strategy.\n\nIf I select Earth:\n- Full House would go from Level 5 (140 chips, 12 mult) to Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult)\n- That's +25 chips and +2 mult\n\nIf I select Uranus:\n- Two Pair would go from Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult) to Level 5 (100 chips, 6 mult)\n- That's +20 chips and +1 mult\n\nSince I'm entering Ante 5/8 with increasingly difficult chip requirements, I should strengthen my primary strategy. Full House has been my main scoring hand and with Card Sharp, I can reliably double-play it for huge scores. The Earth planet would make Full House even stronger.\n\nTwo Pair is a backup option, but it's harder to consistently form and scores less. I should focus on my winning strategy.\n\nI'll select Earth (position 1) to level up Full House.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
