{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3 (in SHOP phase, specifically TAROT_PACK selection)\n- Current Money: $0\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Blue Joker: +88 chips (for 44 remaining cards in deck)\n  2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. The Devil: Enhances 1 card into a Gold Card ($3 if held at end of round)\n2. Justice: Enhances 1 card into a Glass Card (X2 Mult, 1 in 4 chance to destroy)\n3. The Lovers: Enhances 1 card into a Wild Card (can be used as any suit)\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n7. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nMy current strategy revolves around:\n- Playing Two Pair (Level 3, 60 base chips, 4 base mult)\n- Blue Joker for +88 chips\n- Shoot the Moon for +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n\nLet me evaluate each tarot card:\n\n**The Devil (Gold Card):**\n- Effect: $3 if held at end of round\n- This would give me passive income, which could be useful for future shops\n- But it doesn't directly help me score more chips during rounds\n- The Queen of Clubs (position 4) would be a good target since I want to hold Queens anyway for Shoot the Moon\n\n\n- Justice offers a multiplicative boost that's more immediately impactful than passive money generation. The X2 Mult effect directly amplifies my scoring, though the destruction risk requires careful consideration of which card to enhance. The Lovers card feels less aligned with my Two Pair strategy since suit manipulation doesn't factor into that hand type.\n\nFor my current approach, applying Justice to the Queen of Clubs initially seemed promising, but I need to reconsider my priorities. Holding Queens generates +13 Mult through Shoot the Moon, which conflicts with playing them. If I use Justice on a Queen, I'd be sacrificing the held card bonus for a multiplicative effect when played—but the X2 Mult from a Glass Card actually compounds my scoring more effectively than the additive +13 Mult from holding it.\n\nLet me work through the math: playing a Glass Queen in my Two Pair gives me base 4 Mult, plus 13 from holding another Queen equals 17, then multiplied by 2 from the Glass effect yields 34 Mult total. That's substantially better than just holding the Queen for the flat bonus. The 25% destruction risk is a drawback, but the potential payoff seems worth it. The Devil card offers a different path—generating $3 per round if held—which could fund future upgrades, though it doesn't directly boost my current scoring.\n\nWeighing both options, The Devil on the Queen of Clubs feels like the stronger play. I'm already committed to holding Queens for Shoot the Moon anyway, so the passive income stacks naturally with my existing strategy without adding any risk of card destruction. I'll apply it to position 4.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,4]"}
