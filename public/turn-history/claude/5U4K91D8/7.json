{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 1 (just beat Small Blind)\n- Current Money: $4\n- Inventory: 1 joker (Blue Joker giving +104 chips currently)\n- In the SHOP phase\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Obelisk Joker - $11 (can't afford, only have $4)\n2. Pluto Planet - $3 (levels up High Card)\n3. Celestial Pack - $4 (choose 1 of 3 planet cards)\n4. Blank Voucher - $10 (can't afford)\n5. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**What I can afford with $4:**\n- Pluto for $3 (would leave me with $1)\n- Celestial Pack for $4 (would leave me with $0)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI've been playing Two Pair consistently (3 times last round). Blue Joker is now providing +104 chips to every hand, which is great.\n\nLooking at my options:\n1. **Pluto ($3)**: Levels up High Card. I haven't played any high card hands, so this isn't useful for my current strategy.\n\n2. **Celestial Pack ($4)**: Choose from 3 planet cards. This could let me level up Two Pair, which I've been playing consistently. Leveling Two Pair would increase its base chips and mult, making it stronger for future rounds.\n\nSince I've played Two Pair 3 times and it's clearly my main hand type, investing in a Celestial Pack could give me a planet card to level it up. This would be more valuable than Pluto (which levels High Card that I don't use).\n\nHowever, I should also consider just moving to the next round. I have Blue Joker now which adds significant chips. The Big Blind will likely require around 450 chips (typically 1.5x the Small Blind).\n\n\nLet me calculate if I can beat the Big Blind with my current setup:\n- Two Pair base: 20 chips + 2 mult\n- With typical cards (two aces and two 5s): 20 + 11 + 11 + 5 + 5 = 52 chips\n- Mult: 2\n- Blue Joker adds: +104 chips\n- Total chips per hand: (52 + 104) × 2 = 312 chips\n\nIf Big Blind is 450 chips, I'd need 2 hands of Two Pair to beat it. That should be doable. The Celestial Pack would help strengthen Two Pair further, but I might not need it to pass this round.\n\nHowever, the pack costs everything I have, and it lets me pick a planet card to use immediately. If I can upgrade Two Pair to level 2—gaining roughly 10 more chips and an extra mult—my hands become significantly more powerful for upcoming rounds. Since I'm relying heavily on Two Pair with the Blue Joker multiplying everything, investing in that upgrade now would pay dividends later. I'll go ahead and buy it.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
