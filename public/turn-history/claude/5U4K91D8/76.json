{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 10 (Boss Blind)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Boss Description: \"Decrease level of played poker hand\"\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (2 chips per card remaining in deck)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 5 (140 base chips, 12 base mult) - played 4 times\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 base chips, 5 base mult) - played 13 times\n\n**Boss Effect Analysis:**\nThis boss \"Decrease level of played poker hand\" - this means every time I play a hand, that hand type's level will be decreased by 1. This is particularly punishing for my strategy since I've invested heavily in upgrading Full House to Level 5.\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n\nWith the Boss effect, if I play Full House:\n- First play: Level 5 → Level 4 (115 chips, 10 mult)\n- Second play: Level 4 → Level 3 (90 chips, 8 mult)\n- And so on...\n\nLet me calculate what I can expect:\n\n**First Full House play (at Level 5 before boss effect):**\n- Base chips: 140\n- Base mult: 12\n- Blue Joker: +106 chips\n- Cards in Full House typically add chips (let's say 5 cards averaging ~10 chips each = 50 chips)\n\n\n- Total chips before mult: ~296 chips\n- Since this is the opening play, Card Sharp won't trigger yet (needs prior play this round)\n- Base mult: 12\n- Total: ~296 × 12 = ~3,552 chips\n\nThat's not enough to clear the 10,000 chip requirement on the first hand alone. I need to play Full House multiple times to stack the multiplier effects, but the boss keeps degrading the hand level each time I use it.\n\nOn the second play, the hand drops to Level 4 after the boss effect triggers. Now Card Sharp activates since the hand has been played once already. The multiplier triples to 30, and with roughly 271 chips (accounting for Blue Joker's +106 contribution and card bonuses), I get ~8,130 chips. Combined with the first play's 3,552, that reaches 11,682 chips—enough to beat the 10,000 threshold.\n\nWith Troubadour reducing my hand count by one each round, I'll have several plays available. Since my projections show success with just two Full House plays, I'm confident in proceeding. The only viable action from here is to execute the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
