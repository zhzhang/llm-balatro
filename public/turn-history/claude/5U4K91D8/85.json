{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $8\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (based on deck size)\n2. Showman - Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. To Do List (Joker) - Earn $4 if poker hand is a Pair - $4\n2. Mercury (Planet) - Level up Pair +1 Mult and +15 chips - $3\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Playing cards - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Seed Money - Raise interest cap to $10 - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult) - my main hand, played 6 times\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult) - played 13 times\n- Pair: Level 1 (10 chips, 2 mult) - played 0 times\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just successfully upgraded Full House from Level 5 to Level 6, which is great. Now I'm back in the shop with $8 remaining.\n\nEntering Ante 5, the chip requirements will be much higher. Let me think about what I should do:\n\n1. **To Do List ($4)** - This would give me $4 whenever I play a Pair. However, Pair is Level 1 and weak. This doesn't synergize well with my current strategy focused on Full House.\n\n\n2. **Mercury ($3)** - Leveling Pair doesn't align with my Full House-focused approach. **Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)** - Could improve my card selection, leaving $2 after purchase. **Seed Money ($10)** - Out of reach. **Reroll ($5)** - Would reset the shop but leave only $3. **Proceeding without purchases** - Preserves my $8 for interest accumulation and future rounds. Since I'm moving into Ante 5 with significantly higher chip thresholds, I need to decide whether to invest in immediate upgrades or bank my money for compounding interest and better shop opportunities later.\n\nMy Full House strategy is performing well after the Level 6 upgrade, and Card Sharp's X3 multiplier on repeated hands is essential to my scoring. Blue Joker continues scaling with deck size, and I've maxed out my joker slots. None of the current shop items directly strengthen this strategy—To Do List and Mercury target Pair hands I don't play. The Jumbo Standard Pack is tempting but expensive without clear synergy. Saving my $8 makes more sense: I'll earn $1 interest (capped at $5), preserve capital for superior shop offerings, and rely on my already-solid Full House foundation to handle the escalating blind requirements.","action":"\"round_select\""}
