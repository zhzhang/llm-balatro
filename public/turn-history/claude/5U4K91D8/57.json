{"reasoning":"I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK step and need to choose between two jokers:\n1. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand (Uncommon)\n2. Half Joker: +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards (Common)\n\nI just sold Shoot the Moon, so now I have 4/5 joker slots filled. I have $6.\n\nLooking at my current strategy:\n- I've been heavily relying on Two Pair (Level 4, played 10 times)\n- Card Sharp gives me X3 Mult when I play the same hand type twice in a round\n- Blue Joker gives me consistent +106 chips based on deck size\n- Troubadour gives me +2 hand size (10 cards) but costs 1 hand per round\n- Showman makes cards appear multiple times in shop\n\nThe two options:\n\n**Space Joker**: \n- 25% chance to upgrade the hand I play\n- Over time, this could help level up my Two Pair even more\n- Could also help level up other hands\n- It's Uncommon rarity\n- Long-term value through hand leveling\n\n**Half Joker**:\n- +20 Mult if I play 3 or fewer cards\n- Would work with Pair (2 cards) or Three of a Kind (3 cards)\n- Doesn't work with my main strategy of Two Pair (requires 4 cards)\n- With Troubadour giving me 10 cards, I rarely need to play small hands\n\nMy previous reasoning concluded that Space Joker is better because:\n1. It can help level up my Two Pair over time\n2. It's more flexible - works with any hand type\n3. Half Joker doesn't align with my Two Pair strategy\n\nSo I should select Space Joker (position 1).\n\nThe command should be: select 1","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
