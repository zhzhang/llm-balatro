{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12 (about to face Boss Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $2 (spent $5 on reroll)\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice in round\n5. Astronomer - Makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs FREE\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. The Emperor ($3) - Creates up to 2 random Tarot cards - Can't afford, need $3 but only have $2\n2. Neptune ($0) - FREE Planet card for Straight Flush - Thanks to Astronomer!\n3. Jumbo Standard Pack ($6) - Can't afford\n4. Seed Money voucher ($10) - Can't afford\n5. Current Reroll Cost: $6 - Can't afford\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 7 (190 chips, 16 mult) - My main hand\n- Straight Flush: Level 1 (100 chips, 8 mult)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 2 (90 chips, 10 mult)\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe reroll revealed Neptune, which is FREE thanks to Astronomer! However, Neptune levels up Straight Flush, which I haven't played at all and doesn't fit my Full House strategy.\n\nWith only $2 left, my options are:\n1. Buy Neptune for $0 (free) - but Straight Flush isn't useful for my strategy\n2. Proceed to round_select with $2\n\n\nTaking Neptune feels pointless since I'm committed to Full House, which has consistently scored 3,000-12,000+ chips per round. The Boss Blind likely needs 15,000-20,000 chips to beat, and I can't afford anything else that would meaningfully help. I'll skip the free card and move forward with my current setup. and use it immediately. However, that would level up Straight Flush, which I don't use. Since leveling that hand won't help me against the Boss Blind and I need to preserve resources for upcoming rounds, I'll skip Neptune and move forward.","action":"\"round_select\""}
