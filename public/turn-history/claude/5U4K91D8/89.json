{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big Blind\n- Chips Needed: 16,500\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Current Money: $8\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n2. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4. Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n7. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips, Gold Card)\n8. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n9. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n10. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +78 Chips (39 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Showman\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult)\n\n**Available Hands in Current Hand:**\nLooking at my cards:\n- Three 8s: 8 of Spades, 8 of Hearts, 8 of Diamonds = THREE OF A KIND!\n- Two Queens: Queen of Hearts, Queen of Clubs = PAIR\n- Two Jacks: Jack of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds = PAIR\n\n\n- \nI can play the three 8s for a Three of a Kind. With the base 90 chips and 9 multiplier, plus the card values (24 chips total from the three 8s) and the Blue Joker's +78 bonus, I'd score 192 chips before applying the multiplier. This is my strongest immediate option.\n\nPlaying it once gives 1,728 chips. If I use Card Sharp to replay it with a 3x multiplier, I'd get 5,184 chips on the second play, totaling 6,912 chips—still far below the 16,500 target.\n\nBut I notice I can actually form a Full House by combining the three 8s with either the two Queens or two Jacks. A Full House has a base of 165 chips with a 8x multiplier, which should give me significantly more scoring potential than the Three of a Kind alone. Oh! Blue Joker's value decreases as cards leave the deck—it's currently contributing +78 chips. I'll play the Full House with three 8s and two Queens (positions 1, 4, 6, 7, 10) to build toward the target, then use Card Sharp to triple the multiplier on a second hand for a combined score over 16,500.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,4,6,7,10]"}
