{"reasoning":"Looking at the failed action, I tried to `buy_card 1` (Flower Pot), but it failed with \"Cannot buy card at position 1\". \n\nLooking at the shop:\n- Shop Cards:\n  1: Name: Flower Pot. Description: X3 Mult if poker hand contains a Diamond card, Club card, Heart card, and Spade card. Rarity: Uncommon. Cost: $6\n  2: Name: Runner. Description: Gains +15 Chips if played hand contains a Straight (Currently +0 Chips). Rarity: Common. Cost: $5\n\nI have $7, and Flower Pot costs $6, so I have enough money. The issue must be that I'm at max jokers (5/5), and Flower Pot is a joker card. The system prompt says \"If you see an error saying that you cannot select or buy a joker or consumable, it is because you have reached the maximum capacity for that type of card. You may sell a joker or consumable or use the cost of a joker or consumable to make space for a new one.\"\n\nSo I need to sell a joker first to make room. Let me look at my current jokers:\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (currently 53 cards in deck) - This gives me +106 chips per hand, pretty solid\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop - This is useful for getting multiple copies of good cards\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round - This is crucial for drawing more cards\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice - This is KEY for my strategy, giving me X3 mult on the second Full House\n5. Astronomer - Free planet cards - This helped me get the free Celestial Pack\n\nWhich one should I sell?\n- Blue Joker gives +106 chips. With my Full House at 215 base chips + card chips, this is decent but not multiplicative.\n\n\n- Showman's benefit is limited right now since I'm not seeing valuable duplicates in the shop.\n- Troubadour's +2 hand size is important for consistency, but Flower Pot's X3 multiplier would be more impactful.\n- Card Sharp is non-negotiable since it's core to my strategy of stacking multipliers on repeated hands.\n- Astronomer already served its purpose with the Celestial Pack upgrade, so it's the least essential going forward.\n\nIf I acquire Flower Pot, I'd stack X3 from Card Sharp with X3 from Flower Pot when all suits are present, creating a massive multiplier effect.\n\nI need to decide between selling Showman or Astronomer. Astronomer provides ongoing value through future planet card draws that could upgrade Full House further, while Showman only enables duplicates that aren't currently useful. I'll sell Showman for $2 to reach $9, buy Flower Pot for $6, and have $3 remaining.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
