{"reasoning":"I'm in the PLANET_PACK phase after buying a Celestial Pack. I need to choose one of three planet cards:\n\n1. Uranus (lvl.3): Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips\n2. Earth (lvl.1): Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips  \n3. Pluto (lvl.1): Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n\nLooking at my strategy:\n- Two Pair is my main hand type (Level 3, played 7 times)\n- I just bought Card Sharp which gives X3 Mult if I play the same hand twice in a round\n- Two Pair is at Level 3: Base Chips 60, Base Mult 4\n\nIf I select Uranus:\n- Two Pair would go to Level 4: Base Chips 80, Base Mult 5\n- This directly buffs my most-played hand\n\nIf I select Earth:\n- Full House would go to Level 2: Base Chips 65, Base Mult 6\n- I've only played Full House once (just recently for 2,584 chips)\n- This is not my primary strategy\n\nIf I select Pluto:\n- High Card would go to Level 2: Base Chips 15, Base Mult 2\n- I've never played High Card\n- This is completely irrelevant to my strategy\n\nThe clear choice is Uranus. Two Pair is my core strategy, I've played it 7 times already, and with Card Sharp now in my lineup, buffing Two Pair becomes even more valuable since I can play it multiple times per round with the X3 multiplier.\n\nUranus will increase Two Pair from:\n- Level 3: 60 chips, 4 mult\n- To Level 4: 80 chips, 5 mult\n\nThis is a +20 chips and +1 mult boost to every Two Pair I play, which compounds with Card Sharp's X3 multiplier on the second play.\n\n\nselect 1","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
