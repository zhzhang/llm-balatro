{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK step, choosing between two jokers\n- I have 5/5 joker slots filled, so I'll need to sell one if I want to add a new joker\n- Current money: $4\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Space Joker (Uncommon): 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand\n2. Half Joker (Common): +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (depends on deck size)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand (hasn't been useful due to boss effects)\n3. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop (passive shop effect)\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round (gives me 10 cards in hand but costs a hand)\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round (very powerful)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy primary strategy has been Two Pair (Level 4), which I've played 10 times. Card Sharp has been excellent for this strategy - playing Two Pair twice in a round with the X3 multiplier.\n\nLooking at the new joker options:\n\n**Space Joker:** \n- 25% chance to upgrade the hand I play\n- This could help level up my hands over time\n- Would synergize well with my Two Pair strategy - could help level it up even more\n- However, it's random and unreliable\n\n**Half Joker:**\n- +20 Mult if I play 3 or fewer cards\n- This would work great with Pair plays (2 cards) or Three of a Kind (3 cards)\n- However, my main strategy has been Two Pair, which requires 4 cards minimum\n\n\n- Troubadour gives me +2 hand size, so I have 10 cards, which makes it harder to justify playing only 3 cards\n\n**Consideration of my current jokers:**\n\nBlue Joker consistently delivers ~100+ chips and is solid. Shoot the Moon has been nearly useless—bosses debuff face cards, so I rarely have Queens in hand, and +13 Mult per Queen doesn't compare to other effects. Showman helps in shops but doesn't directly impact rounds.\n\n4. **Troubadour** - Gives me 10 cards in hand but costs me a hand each round. The extra cards are nice but costly.\n5. **Card Sharp** - This is my MVP joker. X3 Mult when playing the same hand twice is incredible.\n\nNeither Space Joker nor Half Joker aligns well with my current approach—Space Joker is too unreliable, and Half Joker doesn't work with my Two Pair strategy since that requires 4+ cards. If forced to pick, Space Joker edges ahead because it could gradually level up my Two Pair, it's rarer as an Uncommon, and even at 25% chance, it accumulates value across multiple hands. The real question is whether either justifies replacing what I have.\n\nMy joker slots are already full, so I'd need to sacrifice something. Shoot the Moon has been nearly useless, and Showman only matters in shops, making either a reasonable candidate to sell. But I'm wondering if skipping this booster entirely makes more sense—I'm at Ante 4/8 and things will only get tougher, so Space Joker's potential to strengthen my hands over time might actually be worth the trade-off, especially as the difficulty ramps up.\n\nI'll go ahead and take it. The plan is to sell Shoot the Moon first, then select Space Joker from the pack.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
