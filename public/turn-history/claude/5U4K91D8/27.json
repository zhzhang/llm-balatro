{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $3\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (2 chips per remaining card in deck)\n  2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n  3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n- Max Jokers: 5 (2 slots available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (both slots available)\n- Owned Tags: Uncommon Tag - Shop has a free Uncommon Joker\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed\n- Boss Description: Play only 1 hand type this round\n- Reward: $5\n- Cannot skip boss blinds\n\n**Performance History:**\nLooking at my last played hands:\n- 3,060 chips (Ante 2, Small Blind) - way above the 800 needed\n- 728 chips (Ante 1, Boss)\n- 462 chips (Ante 1, Big Blind)\n\nAll hands were Two Pair. My Two Pair is Level 3 with 60 base chips and 4 base mult.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Boss Blind requires playing only 1 hand type, which is perfect for my strategy since I've been exclusively playing Two Pair anyway. I need 1600 chips to beat this blind.\n\nMy last hand scored 3,060 chips, which is nearly double what I need. The Boss restriction doesn't hurt me at all since I'm already committed to Two Pair.\n\nI have an Uncommon Tag that will give me a free Uncommon Joker in the shop after this round, which should significantly strengthen my build.\n\nSince I cannot skip boss blinds, and I'm confident I can beat this with my current setup (I just scored 3,060 chips against an 800 requirement, and now I only need 1600), the only logical action is to play the round.\n\n\nI don't have any consumables to use or jokers worth selling. Rearranging my jokers won't provide any meaningful benefit given how they synergize. The path forward is straightforward—play the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
