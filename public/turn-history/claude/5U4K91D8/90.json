{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Big Blind\n- Chips Needed: 16,500\n- Current Chips: 4,018\n- Remaining chips needed: 16,500 - 4,018 = 12,482\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $8\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n5. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. 9 of Hearts (+9 chips)\n7. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n8. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n9. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n10. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +68 Chips (34 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Showman\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult) - Played 7 times\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult)\n\n**Available Hands in Current Hand:**\nLooking at my cards:\n- Two Jacks: Jack of Hearts (5), Jack of Diamonds (9) = PAIR\n\n\n- Two 3s: 3 of Spades (4), 3 of Diamonds (10) = PAIR\n- Two pairs = TWO PAIR\n- Spades flush potential: King, 7, 4, 3 of Spades (4 cards)\n\nI can't form a Full House currently. Let me evaluate my options:\n\n**Option 1: Play Two Pair now**\nIf I play Two Pair (Jacks + 3s):\n- Base chips: 80\n- Card chips: 10 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 26\n- Blue Joker: +68\n- Showman and Card Sharp multipliers apply, but I need to calculate the exact total with all modifiers\n\n. Playing this hand twice would give me 870 chips on the first play, then 2,610 on the second when Card Sharp triggers for X3. That's only 3,480 chips combined—far short of the 12,482 I need.\n\n**Option 2: Discard to find a Full House**\nI need three of a kind in one rank plus a pair in another. Right now I have two Jacks and two 3s, with the remaining cards being singles. Discarding strategically could help me hit a three-of-a-kind that would complete a Full House.\n\nLooking at what's left in the deck, there are 2 more Jacks and 2 more 3s available—4 cards total out of 34 that would immediately give me the Full House I need. Since I've already played Full House once this round, Card Sharp would activate on the next one for a X3 multiplier boost. With the Blue Joker's chip bonus and the Full House's base multiplier of 14, that X3 from Card Sharp would push the total to around 11,046 chips.\n\nEven with two hands remaining, playing Full House twice—once without the multiplier and once with Card Sharp active—would net me roughly 14,728 chips from those plays alone. Combined with my current 4,018, that reaches 18,746 chips, which clears the 16,500 target. My best move is to keep the pair of Jacks and discard everything else to hunt for trips.\n\nNow I'm weighing whether keeping both pairs—Jacks and 3s—gives me better odds. With both pairs held, I'd hit a Full House on any of 4 remaining cards (two Jacks or two 3s) out of 34 available. But if I keep only the Jacks and discard more aggressively, I open up more drawing possibilities, though I'm limited to a single 5-card discard per hand.\n\nLet me reconsider my card positions. I need to be careful not to discard cards I'm trying to keep as pairs. The King, 7, and 4 are clear singles to remove, but I should verify which 3s and which position holds my second Jack before finalizing what hits the discard pile.\n\nLooking at my actual holdings: I have a pair of Jacks at positions 5 and 9, and a pair of 3s at positions 4 and 10. The remaining singles are the high cards and mid-range cards that won't help me. Discarding five of these unpaired cards—specifically the King, 7, 4, 9, and 10—gives me the best shot at drawing either another Jack or another 3 to make a Full House.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,6,7]"}
