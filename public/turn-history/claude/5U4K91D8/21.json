{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $0\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Blue Joker: +104 chips\n  2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n- Max Jokers: 5 (3 slots available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (both slots available)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Arrowhead: +50 chips per Spade played ($7) - Can't afford\n2. Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 3 playing cards ($4) - Can't afford\n3. Blank Voucher: Does nothing? ($10) - Can't afford\n4. Reroll: $5 - Can't afford\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just used The Devil tarot card to turn a Queen of Clubs into a Gold Card, which gives $3 when held at end of round. This synergizes well with my Shoot the Moon joker since I want to hold Queens anyway.\n\nCurrently, I have $0, so I cannot buy anything in the shop. My options are:\n1. Try to buy something - but I can't afford anything\n2. Sell a joker - but both my jokers are useful\n3. Proceed to round_select\n\nSince I have no money and nothing affordable in the shop, the only logical action is to proceed to the round select phase. I'll need to start playing the next blind to earn more money.\n\nLet me verify my strategy is sound:\n- Blue Joker gives +104 chips (solid chip boost)\n- Shoot the Moon gives +13 Mult per Queen held\n- I have a Gold Queen that will give me $3 at end of round if held\n- Two Pair is my main hand type (Level 3)\n\nThis setup should work well for Ante 2. The Gold Queen will generate passive income while also triggering Shoot the Moon's multiplier bonus.\n\n\nSince I can't afford anything here, I need to move forward to the blind selection phase and start earning money for the next shop visit.","action":"\"round_select\""}
