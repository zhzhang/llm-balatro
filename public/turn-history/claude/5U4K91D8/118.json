{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 14\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- At max capacity for jokers (5/5)\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed\n- Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed, All Diamond cards are debuffed\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (53 cards in deck)\n2. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n3. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n4. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n5. Flower Pot - X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. The Fool - Creates Earth (lvl.8 Full House) - Cost: $3 (FREE with Astronomer)\n2. The Emperor - Creates up to 2 random Tarot cards - Cost: $3\n3. Standard Pack - Cost: $4\n4. Standard Pack - Cost: $4\n5. Paint Brush Voucher - +1 hand size - Cost: $10\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n\nMy primary strategy revolves around Full House at Level 8 (215 base chips, 18 base mult). With my jokers:\n- Blue Joker: +106 chips\n- Flower Pot: X3 mult (if all 4 suits)\n- Card Sharp: X3 mult (if same hand played twice)\n\nLast round I scored:\n- First Full House: 18,846 chips (with Flower Pot X3)\n- Second play was Two Pair: 2,730 chips\n\nFor the Big Blind (30,000 chips), I need to calculate what I can achieve:\n\nFirst Full House (with all 4 suits):\n- Base chips: 215\n\n\n- Card chips: ~50 (average)\n- Blue Joker: +106\n- Total: ~371 chips\n- Base mult: 18\n- Flower Pot: X3 = 54 mult\n- Total: 371 × 54 = 20,034 chips\n\nSecond Full House (with all 4 suits, Card Sharp active):\n- Total chips: ~371 chips\n- Base mult: 18\n- Card Sharp: X3 = 54\n- Flower Pot: X3 = 162 mult\n- Total: 371 × 162 = 60,102 chips\n\nCombined: 20,034 + 60,102 = 80,136 chips total. This comfortably covers both blinds with room to spare. The strategy is solid—I should focus on securing the Full House planet card and avoid unnecessary purchases that would drain my limited funds. can calculate the exact scoring boost. The first Full House would score around 23,760 chips with Flower Pot's X3 multiplier, while the second would reach 71,280 chips thanks to Card Sharp stacking with Flower Pot for X180 total multiplier. Combined, that's 95,040 chips—a massive jump from my current 60,102. Since The Fool is free, buying it is an obvious choice.\n\nWith $7 remaining after, I can't afford Paint Brush ($10) or build toward other expensive upgrades. The Emperor ($3) offers random Tarot effects which feel unreliable compared to my proven Full House strategy. A Standard Pack ($4) might help, but my current deck is already performing well. I'll just take The Fool and move forward without additional purchases.","action":"\"buy_and_use_consumable\"\nPositions: [1]"}
