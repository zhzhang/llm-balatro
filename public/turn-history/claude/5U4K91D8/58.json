{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $6\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (based on deck size)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand (just acquired)\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Saturn (Planet) - Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips. Cost: $3\n2. Zany Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains Three of a Kind. Cost: $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack (Tarot) - Cost: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Tarot Merchant - Tarots appear 2X more frequently. Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**My Strategy So Far:**\n- Two Pair is my main hand (Level 4, played 10 times)\n- Card Sharp has been my MVP - X3 Mult when playing the same hand twice\n- Blue Joker provides consistent chip value\n- Space Joker will hopefully help level up my hands over time\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n1. **Saturn ($3)**: Would level up Straight, but I haven't been playing Straights. Not useful for my current strategy.\n\n2. **Zany Joker ($4)**: +12 Mult for Three of a Kind. I haven't been playing Three of a Kind much (0 times according to hand levels). Not aligned with my Two Pair strategy.\n\n3. **Arcana Pack ($4)**: Could give me useful tarot cards for deck manipulation, enhancements, or consumable effects. Tarots can be very powerful.\n\n\n4. **Tarot Merchant ($10)**: Beyond my budget at $6. **Reroll ($5)**: Costs $5, leaving just $1—might surface better options. **Round Select**: Skip the shop and bank my $6 for future rounds.\n\nSince I'm halfway through the run, chip scaling becomes critical. My Two Pair foundation (Level 4, 80 base chips) combined with Card Sharp's multiplier has carried me, but I need to evaluate whether investing now or preserving capital serves my endgame better.\n\nThe current engine generates solid output: Blue Joker contributes 106 chips, and when Card Sharp triggers on repeated Two Pairs, the multiplication compounds significantly. However, higher Antes demand exponentially more scoring power, and my current setup may plateau without strategic additions.\n\nTarot cards offer meaningful scaling options—mult cards provide +4 mult per score, bonus cards add +30 chips, and glass/steel variants multiply scoring further. A $4 Arcana Pack purchase would leave $2 remaining, but the enhancement potential could be substantial enough to push through tougher rounds. Alternatively, banking the $6 and letting interest accumulate might provide more flexibility later, though I'd miss the immediate power spike these cards could deliver.\n\nThe Arcana Pack feels like the right move. With Showman potentially surfacing more tarot opportunities, investing now to strengthen my core cards makes sense. I can always decline unfavorable options, but having access to these enhancements is worth the capital outlay.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
