{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 9\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $5\n- Current Blind Option: Big Blind - 7500 chips needed, reward: $4\n- Skip Tag: Economy Tag (doubles money, max $40)\n- Upcoming Blind: Boss - 10000 chips needed, decreases level of played poker hand, reward: $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (varies based on deck size)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand already played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 base chips, 5 base mult) - my primary strategy\n- All other hands: Level 1\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- Last three hands on Small Blind (5000 chips needed):\n  - 1,040 chips (Two Pair)\n  - 2,700 chips (Two Pair with Card Sharp)\n  - 2,460 chips (Two Pair with Card Sharp)\n  - Total: 6,200 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Big Blind requires 7,500 chips. Based on my recent performance:\n- First Two Pair without Card Sharp: ~1,040-2,700 chips\n- Subsequent Two Pairs with Card Sharp (X3 mult): ~2,460-2,700 chips\n\nWith Troubadour giving me -1 hand per round, I'll likely have 2-3 hands available. Let me estimate:\n- Hand 1: ~1,500 chips (Two Pair base)\n\n\n- Hand 2: ~2,500 chips (Two Pair with Card Sharp X3)\n- Hand 3: ~2,500 chips (Two Pair with Card Sharp X3)\n- Total: ~6,500 chips\n\nThis falls short of 7,500 chips, though I do have discards available to hunt for better pairs. The real concern is the Boss Blind coming next—it decreases the level of whatever poker hand I play, which would tank my Two Pair strategy by dropping it from Level 4 to Level 3 and severely cutting my base chips and multiplier. This creates a cascading problem for reaching the 10,000 chip threshold.\n\nSkipping the Big Blind grants me the Economy Tag, which doubles my current $5 to $10. That extra capital opens up meaningful options: I could purchase planet cards to strengthen Two Pair before facing the boss, grab jokers or consumables for additional support, or reroll shops for better offerings. Playing the Big Blind instead nets me only $4 more (bringing me to $9 total), but leaves me vulnerable to not hitting 7,500 chips and forces me into the boss fight with a weakened hand after the level decrease. The Economy Tag path preserves my resources while giving me more flexibility to prepare. better choice. The shop phase is essential—I can use those $9 to purchase planet cards and boost my Two Pair to Level 5 or 6, so even after the Boss decreases it, I'll still have a strong hand. Skipping gives me $10 but locks me out of shopping entirely, forcing me to face the Boss with an unprepared deck. The risk of losing the Big Blind is worth the opportunity to strengthen my position before the final challenge.\n\nLet me verify my win probability more carefully. With 7,500 chips and my current setup, my Two Pair hands should generate substantial scores. The first Two Pair yields around 1,000 chips with Blue Joker and card values contributing roughly 200 chips combined. The second Two Pair triggers Card Sharp's X3 multiplier on the repeated hand, and even with fewer cards remaining in the deck, Blue Joker still adds significant value, pushing that hand toward similar or higher output.\n\nBy the third Two Pair, I'm maintaining that multiplier advantage, so I'm looking at roughly 7,000 chips total—tight but achievable. I have discards available to hunt for better pairs, and Space Joker could potentially upgrade my hand to Level 5, which would seal the win. The real incentive here is securing shop access afterward, which I'll need to prepare for the Boss.\n\nI'm going to play the Big Blind.","action":"\"play_round\""}
