{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12 (about to face Boss Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $7\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (based on remaining deck cards)\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice in round\n5. Astronomer - Makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs FREE\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Square Joker ($4) - Not particularly useful for my strategy\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack ($6) - Can't afford this\n3. Seed Money voucher ($10) - Can't afford this\n4. Current Reroll Cost: $5 - Can afford to reroll\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 7 (190 chips, 16 mult) - My main hand, played 9 times\n- Four of a Kind: Level 2 (90 chips, 10 mult) - Just upgraded from the Mars planet\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult)\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult) - Played 13 times\n\n**Last Played Hands:**\nAll recent hands have been Full House, scoring between 3,096 and 12,768 chips.\n\n**Analysis:**\nI'm about to face the Boss Blind of Ante 5. Looking at my last played hands, I've been consistently playing Full House and using Card Sharp's X3 multiplier effectively. \n\nI have $7 remaining. My options are:\n\n\n1. Buy Square Joker for $4 - Doesn't align with my 5-card Full House strategy\n2. Reroll shop for $5 - Could reveal better options, especially free Planet packs thanks to Astronomer\n3. Proceed to round_select with $7\n\nSince Astronomer makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs free, rerolling for $5 is appealing—if a Celestial Pack appears, I could grab it for free and level up Full House further. I should weigh whether the potential upside of a better shop justifies spending the money now versus keeping it for later rounds.\n\nMy current deck with Blue Joker, Card Sharp, and Troubadour has been solid for Full House plays. The real question is whether I'm strong enough for the Boss Blind or if I need one more optimization. Given the free Celestial Pack possibility, I'm leaning toward the reroll to see what surfaces.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
