{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 7\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $11\n- I just beat the Big Blind\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 Chips (52 cards × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Duplicates allowed in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\nAll 5 joker slots are filled.\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Venus (Planet): Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips - $3\n- Oops! All 6s (Joker): Doubles all listed probabilities - $4\n- Standard Pack x2: $4 each\n- Director's Cut (Voucher): Reroll Boss Blind 1 time per Ante, $10 per roll - $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy current strategy has been heavily focused on Two Pair, which is at Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult). I've played it 9 times and it's been very effective with Card Sharp giving me the X3 multiplier on the second play.\n\nLooking ahead, I'm about to face the Boss Blind of Ante 3. The chip requirements will increase significantly as I progress through antes.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n1. **Venus**: This levels up Three of a Kind, which I haven't been using. My deck composition and joker setup aren't optimized for Three of a Kind, so this doesn't seem immediately useful.\n\n2. **Oops! All 6s**: This joker doubles probabilities. However, I don't currently have any jokers or effects that rely on probability triggers, so this wouldn't help me right now. Also, my joker slots are full.\n\n\n3. **Standard Packs** could strengthen my deck by giving me more pairs to work with for Two Pair plays. **Director's Cut** is tempting for future boss blind flexibility, but at $10 it leaves me with almost nothing. A **reroll** for $5 might reveal better options than what's currently available.\n\n**My Strategy:**\n\nSince all joker slots are full, I need to decide whether to invest in deck improvements or save resources for upcoming challenges.\n\nMy Two Pair + Card Sharp engine is performing well—the repeated plays generate solid multipliers, especially with Blue Joker and Shoot the Moon providing chip and mult boosts. None of these shop items directly synergize with my current build. Venus targets Three of a Kind which I'm not playing, and Oops! All 6s doesn't fit my strategy. Standard Packs offer uncertain value for their cost, and Director's Cut, while potentially useful later, is too expensive right now.\n\nI should reroll to search for items that either enhance my Two Pair consistency or provide better value than what's currently on offer. If the reroll doesn't yield anything useful, I still have $6 to work with. But spending $5 just to see what appears feels risky—I could end up with nothing better and waste the money.\n\nActually, Director's Cut might be the smarter play here. For $10, I'd get the ability to reroll the Boss Blind coming up, which could be invaluable depending on what effect it has. I'd be left with just $1, but that safety net for a difficult boss could be worth it.\n\nLet me weigh this against rerolling first to see if something more immediately useful appears—maybe a planet card or a synergy joker that helps my current build. If nothing good shows up, I'd still have $6 to spend afterward.\n\nI'll reroll the shop to get better visibility into my options before committing to anything.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
