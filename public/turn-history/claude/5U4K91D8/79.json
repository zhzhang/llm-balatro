{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11 (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Boss Effect: Decrease level of played poker hand\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n4. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n6. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n9. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +66 Chips\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Available Hands:**\n- I have 2 Aces (positions 1, 3)\n- I have 3 Kings (positions 2, 4, 7)\n- This gives me a FULL HOUSE! Three Kings and Two Aces!\n\n**Full House Analysis:**\n\nFull House is at Level 5:\n- Base chips: 140\n- Base mult: 12\n\n**First Full House play (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 7):**\n- Base chips: 140\n- Card chips from the 5 cards: 11 + 10 + 11 + 10 + 10 = 52\n\n\n- Blue Joker: +66\n- Total chips: 258\n- Base mult: 12\n- Card Sharp doesn't activate (first play)\n- Total: 258 × 12 = 3,096 chips\n\nAfter this play, Full House will drop to Level 4 due to boss effect. The second Full House play would yield around 227 chips before multiplier at Level 4, with the Blue Joker contributing roughly 60 chips after some cards are drawn. With a base multiplier of 10 at that level, I'm looking at approximately 2,270 chips from the second hand.\n\nHowever, Card Sharp activates on the second play, tripling the multiplier to 30. This brings the second hand to 227 × 30 = 6,810 chips. Combined with the first play, that's 3,096 + 6,810 = 9,906 chips total—still potentially short of the target.\n\nI should verify the exact Full House level progression. The metadata shows Level 5 at 140 chips and 12 multiplier, so Level 4 would be slightly lower. Let me recalculate with the specific card values to ensure accuracy. 6,810 = 9,906 chips total. I'm just under the 10,000 threshold, but Space Joker's 25% upgrade chance could push me over, and my Blue Joker estimate might be conservative. Since I have three Kings and two Aces forming a Full House—my strongest available hand—I should play it with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.\n\nPlaying this Full House gives me roughly 3,096 chips on the first hand. If I advance to a second play after the boss effect, the Level 4 hand would score around 6,810 chips with Card Sharp's multiplier boost, though some chip values will shift as cards get drawn.\n\nThat puts me near 9,900 chips total—close enough to 10,000 that I should proceed with this strategy and hope Space Joker triggers an upgrade or I get a favorable draw.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,7]"}
