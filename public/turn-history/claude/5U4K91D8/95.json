{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12 (just finished Big Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $13\n- Joker slots: 5/5 (full)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2\n\n**My last action failed**: I tried to buy_card position 1 (Astronomer joker), but it failed with \"Cannot buy card at position 1\". This is because my joker slots are full (5/5). I need to sell a joker first before I can buy Astronomer.\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Astronomer ($8) - Makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs free\n2. Square Joker ($4) - Gains +4 chips per 4-card hand (not useful with my 7-card hands from Troubadour)\n3. Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)\n4. Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)\n5. Seed Money voucher ($10)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (very strong)\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop (useful for Astronomer combo)\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round (gives me 7-card hands)\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice (crucial for my strategy)\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade played hand\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy main winning strategy is playing Full House repeatedly with Card Sharp's X3 mult bonus. Full House is at Level 7 (190 base chips, 16 base mult).\n\nTo buy Astronomer, I need to sell one of my jokers first. Let me evaluate which joker is least valuable:\n\n1. **Blue Joker** (+106 chips) - Very strong constant boost\n\n\n2. **Showman** - Enables duplicate purchases, synergizes well with Astronomer for stacking planet cards\n3. **Troubadour** - Critical for generating 7-card hands needed to form Full Houses consistently\n4. **Card Sharp** - The linchpin of my strategy, providing X3 multiplier on repeated hands\n5. **Space Joker** - Unreliable probabilistic effect compared to the guaranteed benefits of my other jokers\n\nSpace Joker is the clear choice to sell since it's the least dependable. I'll sell it to free up a slot, then purchase Astronomer to unlock free planet cards and celestial packs.\n\nSelling Space Joker nets me $2 for a total of $15. With Astronomer costing $8, I'll have $7 remaining—exactly enough to grab a Jumbo Celestial Pack for free and further boost my Full House hand before facing the Boss Blind.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [5]"}
