{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $7\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips (Currently providing +2 chips per remaining card in deck)\n\n**Just Beat:** Big Blind with 462 chips using Two Pair\n\n**Upcoming:** Boss Blind (600 chips needed, debuffs all Spade cards)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Fortune Teller Joker - $6 (Common, +1 mult per tarot card used)\n2. Pluto Planet - $3 (levels up High Card)\n3. Jumbo Celestial Pack - $6 (choose 1 of 5 planet cards)\n4. Standard Pack - $4 (choose 1 of 3 playing cards)\n5. Blank Voucher - $10 (does nothing)\n6. Reroll - $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy current strategy relies heavily on Two Pair (Level 2: 40 chips, 3 mult). I've played it 4 times successfully.\n\nFor the Boss Blind (600 chips, debuffs Spades):\n- Need 600 chips\n- All Spade cards are debuffed\n- With Two Pair and Blue Joker, I scored 462 chips last time\n- I need to score more to reach 600\n\nLet me think about my options:\n\n1. **Fortune Teller ($6)** - Not useful yet since I haven't used any tarot cards\n2. **Pluto ($3)** - Levels up High Card, which I don't play\n3. **Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)** - Could level up Two Pair or another hand type\n4. **Standard Pack ($4)** - Adds a playing card to my deck\n5. **Reroll ($5)** - Try for better options\n\nThe most impactful purchase would be the **Jumbo Celestial Pack** for $6. I could use it to level up Two Pair again, which would increase my scoring significantly.\n\n\nLeveling Two Pair from Level 2 to Level 3 would boost it to approximately 60 chips and 4 mult. With my current card values and Blue Joker contribution, that upgrade alone could push my total from 462 to around 550+ chips—getting me much closer to the 600 threshold needed for the Boss Blind.\n\nGiven my $7 budget, the Jumbo Celestial Pack at $6 is the most efficient option. It offers 5 planet cards to select from, giving me flexibility to either level up Two Pair directly with Uranus or pivot to strengthening another hand type if needed.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
