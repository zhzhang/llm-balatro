{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 9\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small (5000 chips needed)\n- Current Chips: 1040/5000 (need 3960 more chips)\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +78 Chips (based on remaining cards in deck - 39 cards left)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: **X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round** - THIS IS KEY!\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand\n\n**Current Hand (10 cards):**\n1. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n4. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n5. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n6. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n9. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n10. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**What I just played:**\n- Two Pair for 1040 chips\n- This means Card Sharp is now active - my next Two Pair will get X3 Mult!\n\n**Available pairs in my hand:**\n- 6s: positions 3, 8 (6 of Spades, 6 of Diamonds)\n- 5s: positions 4, 9 (5 of Spades, 5 of Diamonds)\n\n\n- 4s: positions 5, 10 (4 of Hearts, 4 of Diamonds)\n\nI can form Three different Two Pair combinations: 6s with 5s, 6s with 4s, or 5s with 4s. Since Card Sharp triggers on repeated hands, playing another Two Pair will triple my multiplier. With Two Pair at Level 4 giving 80 base chips and 5 base mult, I need to evaluate which pair combination maximizes my chip gain toward the 5000 blind.\n\nFor the 6s and 5s pairing, I'd get 80 base chips plus 22 from the card values, then Blue Joker adds 78 more for 180 total chips. Multiplying by the 15x mult (5 base × 3 from Card Sharp) yields 2700 chips. Combined with my current 1040, that puts me at 3740—still 1260 short of the blind. Since I have one final hand available, I'm weighing whether to commit now or discard and hope for stronger cards.\n\nMy remaining deck has 2 Queens, 2 Aces, and various other ranks. With only 4 discards and 2 hands left, finding another Two Pair or better hand is possible but risky. Let me verify my first hand calculation to ensure I'm tracking my joker contributions correctly.\n\nThe first hand's 1040 chips came from Two Pair Level 4 with a base of 80 chips, card values totaling 42 (from the Queens and Aces played), plus 86 chips from the Blue Joker, all multiplied by 5. For the second hand, I'm working with Card Sharp active at X3 multiplier—the base remains 80 chips, but now I have 22 chips from the cards played and 78 from the Blue Joker, which gives me 180 chips before applying the multiplier.\n\nMultiplying 180 by the total multiplier of 15 (5 base × 3 from Card Sharp) yields 2700 chips. Combined with the first hand, that's 3740 chips total, still leaving a gap of 1260 chips to reach 5000. The third hand without Card Sharp would only generate around 900 chips with similar cards and a base multiplier of 5—I'd fall short by roughly 360 chips. I need to either find stronger cards through discarding or consider a different hand type entirely to bridge this gap. of Spades, 5 of Spades, 6 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds). This gives me the highest two pair possible with my current hand, and I'll play it now to see if it gets me closer to my score goal.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [3,4,8,9]"}
