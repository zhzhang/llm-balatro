{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (Small Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 2000\n- Current Money: $6\n- Remaining Hands: 3\n- Remaining Discards: 4\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +84 chips (currently 42 cards left in deck × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size (so I have 10 cards), -1 hand each round\n\n**Current Hand (10 cards):**\n1. King of Hearts - +10 chips\n2. 6 of Hearts - +6 chips\n3. Ace of Clubs - +11 chips\n4. Jack of Clubs - +10 chips\n5. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\n6. 5 of Clubs - +5 chips\n7. King of Diamonds - +10 chips\n8. 10 of Diamonds - +10 chips\n9. 9 of Diamonds - +9 chips\n10. 7 of Diamonds - +7 chips\n\n**Available Hand Types:**\n- Pair of Kings: positions 1, 7 (King of Hearts, King of Diamonds)\n- Pair of 9s: positions 5, 9 (9 of Clubs, 9 of Diamonds)\n- Two Pair: Kings and 9s (positions 1, 7, 5, 9)\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI've been playing Two Pair exclusively (Level 3: 60 base chips, 4 base mult). Recent scores: 2,890 and 3,060 chips.\n\n\nThe deck has 4 Queens, 2 Kings, and 2 9s remaining. Playing the Two Pair with my Kings and 9s gives me 60 base chips plus 38 from the cards themselves (10 + 10 + 9 + 9).\n\nThe Blue Joker adds 84 chips for a total of 182 chips. With a base multiplier of 4 from Two Pair Level 3, that's only 728 chips—far short of the 2000 threshold. The issue is I can't activate Shoot the Moon without Queens in hand, so I'm stuck with just the base 4x multiplier.\n\nI'm wondering if I should discard cards to try drawing Queens instead, since my earlier attempts were scoring 2,890-3,060 chips. Something about that approach was working better.\n\nIf I could hold 2 Queens while playing Two Pair, Shoot the Moon would add 26 to my multiplier. With roughly 200 chips from the hand and cards, that would give me 30x total—producing around 6,000 chips. That's the performance level I was hitting before. The key difference is getting Queens into my hand and keeping them there during the play. Right now there are 4 Queens left in the deck, and I have none. I need to figure out the best way to acquire them.\n\nMy approach should be to discard non-essential cards while protecting my existing pairs—the Kings and 9s. I'll target the 6 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 10 of Diamonds for discard, which gives me 5 slots to draw from the remaining deck and hopefully pull Queens while maintaining my pair structure.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,10]"}
