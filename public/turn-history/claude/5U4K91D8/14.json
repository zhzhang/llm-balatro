{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2 (just beat Round 2)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $1\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- Two Pair is now Level 3: 60 base chips, 4 base mult (upgraded from Level 2)\n\n**Next Challenge:**\n- Boss Blind (Round 3 of Ante 1): 600 chips needed\n- Boss effect: All Spade cards are debuffed\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Fortune Teller Joker - $6 (I only have $1)\n2. Pluto Planet - $3 (I only have $1)\n3. Standard Pack - $4 (I only have $1)\n4. Blank Voucher - $10 (I only have $1)\n5. Reroll - $5 (I only have $1)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $1, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop. All options cost at least $3.\n\nMy Two Pair is now Level 3 (60 base chips, 4 base mult), which should give me enough power to beat the Boss Blind.\n\nLet me calculate what I can expect:\n- With Two Pair Level 3: 60 base chips, 4 base mult\n- If I play two pairs again (like two Jacks and two 3s):\n  - Base chips: 60\n  - Card chips: ~26 (10+10+3+3)\n  - Blue Joker: ~104 chips (depends on deck size)\n  - Total chips: 60 + 26 + 104 = 190\n  - Mult: 4\n  - Final score: 190 × 4 = 760 chips\n\nThis should easily beat the 600 chip requirement for the Boss Blind.\n\nThe issue is that the Boss Blind debuffs all Spade cards. If I draw many Spades, they won't contribute to scoring. \n\nEven if Spades are removed from my scoring, I should still find two pairs among the remaining cards. Since I can't afford any shop items with $1, I'll move forward to the next round.","action":"\"round_select\""}
