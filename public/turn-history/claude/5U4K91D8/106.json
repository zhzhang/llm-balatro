{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Boss Blind: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Current Chips: 18,176\n- Chips still needed: 22,000 - 18,176 = 3,824\n- Remaining hands: 1\n- Remaining discards: 2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n2. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n3. Ace of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n4. 7 of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n5. 6 of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n6. 2 of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n7. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n8. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n9. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n10. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - Currently +46 Chips (2 per card remaining in deck = 23 cards remaining)\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice (already used this round - won't trigger again)\n5. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n\n**Analysis:**\nI need 3,824 more chips with only 1 hand remaining.\n\nLooking at possible hands:\n- Two 6s: 6 of Spades, 6 of Hearts (debuffed)\n- Two 7s: 7 of Hearts (debuffed), 7 of Clubs\n- Two Aces: Ace of Hearts (debuffed), Ace of Diamonds\n\n\n- Three of a kind isn't possible, so Full House is out.\n\nThe viable two pair combinations are limited since the Heart cards are debuffed. I could pair the 6s with 7s, or 6s with Aces, or 7s with Aces, but each option includes at least one debuffed card that won't contribute chips.\n\nTesting 6s and Aces: the base hand gives 80 chips at Level 4 with 5x multiplier, plus only the Spade 6 and Diamond Ace contribute 17 additional chips. With the Blue Joker adding 46 chips, I'm looking at 143 total chips times 5 for just 715 points—far too low.\n\nI should consider discarding the debuffed Hearts to chase a stronger combination. With 2 discards left, the remaining deck has mostly non-Heart cards: 7 Spades, 8 Diamonds, 3 Clubs, and 5 debuffed Hearts. The most frequent ranks are 8s (4 cards), 3s (4 cards), and Jacks (2 cards), though I already hold an Ace and 4 that could form trips if I draw their matches.\n\nLet me recalculate the Full House scoring from earlier plays to ensure I'm maximizing my strategy going forward.\n\nFor another Full House attempt, I'd get the base 190 chips and Blue Joker's +46 chips, but Card Sharp won't activate again this round since it already triggered. Without three of a kind currently available, my best move is discarding the four debuffed Hearts to draw fresh cards and hunt for matching ranks that could form a three of a kind. I have two discard actions remaining, so I can refine my hand across multiple draws if the first batch doesn't yield strong combinations.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,4,5,6]"}
