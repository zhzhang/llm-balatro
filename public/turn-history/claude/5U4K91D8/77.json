{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 11 (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Boss Effect: Decrease level of played poker hand\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. King of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n4. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n9. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +86 Chips (currently)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nLooking at my current hand, I can identify:\n- Two pairs of Aces (Spades and Hearts)\n- Two pairs of Kings (Spades and Diamonds)\n- Two pairs of 9s (Clubs and Diamonds)\n- Three Spades (Ace, King, Queen)\n- Four Diamonds (King, 10, 9, 2)\n\nPossible hands:\n1. **Two Pair**: Aces and Kings (cards 1, 4, 2, 7) or Aces and 9s (cards 1, 4, 5, 9) or Kings and 9s (cards 2, 7, 5, 9)\n\n\n2. **Full House**: Would need three of a kind plus a pair, but I only have two of each rank available. I can't form a Full House with this hand.\n\nMy strongest option is Two Pair. I need to consider which pairing maximizes my chip gains given the Boss Blind's hand-level reduction effect. - Base mult: 5\n- Card Sharp doesn't activate (first play)\n- Total: 208 × 5 = 1,040 chips\n\nAfter the boss reduces Two Pair to Level 3, the second play yields roughly 188 chips with a 12x multiplier from Card Sharp's activation, totaling 2,256 chips. Combined with the first play, that's only 3,296 chips—insufficient to win. I need to pivot toward a Full House instead, which offers much stronger scoring potential. To get there, I should strategically discard cards to draw into the right combination.\n\nI'll keep both Aces and both Kings since I have four cards that could form a Full House with one more card of either rank. The deck still has two Kings and two Aces remaining, giving me reasonable odds. I need to discard the lower-value cards—the Queen, the 9s, 5, 10, and 2—to maximize my chances of drawing the third matching card I need.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [3,5,6,8,9]"}
