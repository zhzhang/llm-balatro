{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state, I'm in a PLANET_PACK phase and need to select one of three planet cards:\n\n1. Mercury - Levels up Pair (+1 Mult and +15 chips)\n2. Uranus - Levels up Two Pair (+1 Mult and +20 chips)\n3. Mars - Levels up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n\nLooking at my play history:\n- I've played Two Pair 3 times in the last round\n- I haven't played Pair or Four of a Kind\n\nCurrent hand levels show:\n- Two Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 20, Base Mult 2, Times Played 3\n- Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 10, Base Mult 2, Times Played 0\n- Four of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 60, Base Mult 7, Times Played 0\n\nThe clear choice here is Uranus (option 2) because:\n1. I've been consistently playing Two Pair (3 times already)\n2. It's my most played hand type\n3. Upgrading it will make my primary strategy stronger\n4. Mercury would upgrade Pair, which I haven't been playing\n5. Mars would upgrade Four of a Kind, which is much harder to make and I haven't played it\n\nWith Blue Joker giving +104 chips, upgrading Two Pair to get +20 chips and +1 mult will make each Two Pair hand significantly stronger.\n\nLet me calculate the improvement:\nCurrent Two Pair hand example (with two aces and two 5s):\n- Base: 20 chips, 2 mult\n- Cards: 11 + 11 + 5 + 5 = 32 chips from cards\n- Total chips: 20 + 32 + 104 (Blue Joker) = 156 chips\n- Mult: 2\n- Total: 156 × 2 = 312 chips\n\n\nAfter upgrading with Uranus, the same hand jumps to 176 chips × 3 mult = 528 chips, nearly doubling my output. This confirms Uranus is the right pick to maximize my scoring potential.\n\nThe command should be: select 2","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
