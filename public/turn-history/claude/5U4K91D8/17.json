{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 3 (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Blue Joker: +80 chips (deck has 40 cards remaining)\n\n**Boss Effect:**\nAll Spade cards are debuffed\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades - DEBUFFED\n2. Queen of Hearts - +10 chips\n3. 8 of Hearts - +8 chips\n4. Ace of Clubs - +11 chips\n5. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips\n6. Ace of Diamonds - +11 chips\n7. Queen of Diamonds - +10 chips\n8. 9 of Diamonds - +9 chips\n\n**Non-debuffed cards:**\n- Queen of Hearts (position 2) - +10\n- 8 of Hearts (position 3) - +8\n- Ace of Clubs (position 4) - +11\n- 8 of Clubs (position 5) - +8\n- Ace of Diamonds (position 6) - +11\n- Queen of Diamonds (position 7) - +10\n- 9 of Diamonds (position 8) - +9\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLooking for pairs and two pairs:\n- Pair of 8s: 8♥ (position 3) and 8♣ (position 5)\n- Pair of Aces: A♣ (position 4) and A♦ (position 6)\n- Pair of Queens: Q♥ (position 2) and Q♦ (position 7)\n\n**I have THREE pairs available! This means I can play TWO PAIR!**\n\nTwo Pair is Level 3: Base Chips 60, Base Mult 4\n\n\nNow I need to evaluate which two pair combination maximizes my score. Playing Aces and Queens (positions 2, 4, 6, 7) gives me 60 base + 42 card chips + 80 from Blue Joker = 182 chips × 4 multiplier = 728 total. Alternatively, Aces and 8s (positions 3, 4, 5, 6) would yield slightly less due to the lower card values on the 8s. I'll play the Queen of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, and Queen of Diamonds from positions 2, 4, 6, and 7.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,4,6,7]"}
