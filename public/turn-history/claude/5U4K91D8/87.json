{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 11\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $8\n- I just skipped the Small Blind and should have received the Orbital Tag (upgrade a hand by 3 levels)\n\n**Current Blind Options:**\n1. **Big Blind**: 16,500 chips needed, rewards $4\n   - Tag for skipping: Garbage Tag (Would give $31 for unused discards)\n2. **Boss Blind**: 22,000 chips needed, rewards $5\n   - Boss Description: All Heart cards are debuffed\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips\n2. Showman - Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade played hand\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 6 (165 chips, 14 mult) - my main scoring hand\n- Three of a Kind: Level 4 (90 chips, 9 mult) - interesting, this got leveled up!\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 chips, 5 mult)\n\nWait, I notice Three of a Kind went from Level 1 to Level 4! That must be the result of the Orbital Tag I claimed by skipping the Small Blind. It upgraded Three of a Kind by 3 levels.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nNow I need to decide whether to:\n1. Play the Big Blind (16,500 chips)\n2. Skip the Big Blind to get the Garbage Tag ($31)\n\nLet me estimate my scoring potential:\n\n**Full House scoring (Level 6):**\n- Base: 165 chips, 14 mult\n\n\n- Blue Joker adds 106 chips, plus roughly 40 from card values = 311 total chips\n- First Full House: 311 × 14 = 4,354 chips\n- Second Full House with Card Sharp tripling multiplier: 311 × 42 = 13,062 chips\n- Combined: 17,416 chips, which clears the 16,500 requirement\n\nNow considering whether to skip the Big Blind for the Garbage Tag. The tag would net $31 from 31 unused discards, minus the $4 I'd forfeit—a $27 gain. But that means facing the Boss Blind's 22,000 chip threshold with Hearts debuffed. My two Full Houses still generate around 17,416 chips, which falls short. I'd need to find another approach or accept the risk of failing the Boss Blind. d now with 16,500 chips—definitely beatable. I'll secure the $4 reward and approach the Boss Blind from a stronger position. The Garbage Tag's $31 is appealing, but skipping the Big Blind means facing a tougher Boss with a debuff and forfeiting the reward. The safer approach is better here.","action":"\"play_round\""}
