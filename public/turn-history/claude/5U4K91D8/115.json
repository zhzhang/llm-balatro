{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $3\n- At max capacity for jokers (5/5)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips (53 cards in deck)\n2. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n3. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n4. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n5. Flower Pot - X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. Small Blind: 20,000 chips needed, reward $3, skip tag: Juggle Tag (+3 hand size next round)\n2. Big Blind: 30,000 chips needed, reward $4, skip tag: Polychrome Tag (Next base edition shop Joker is free and becomes Polychrome)\n3. Boss Blind: 40,000 chips needed, reward $5, Boss Description: All Diamond cards are debuffed\n\n**My Strategy Analysis:**\n\nFull House Level 8: 215 base chips, 18 base mult\n\nLet me calculate potential chip earnings:\n\nFirst Full House play (no Card Sharp bonus):\n- Base chips: 215\n- Card chips: ~50 chips (5 cards contributing, assuming 10 chips each on average)\n- Blue Joker: +106 chips\n- Total chips: ~371 chips\n- Base mult: 18\n- Flower Pot (if all 4 suits present): X3 mult = 54 mult\n- Total: 371 * 54 = 20,034 chips\n\nSecond Full House play (with Card Sharp):\n- Base chips: 215\n- Card chips: ~50 chips\n- Blue Joker: +106 chips\n- Total chips: ~371 chips\n\n\n- Base mult: 18\n- Card Sharp: X3 mult = 54 mult\n- Flower Pot (if all 4 suits present): X3 mult = 162 mult\n- Total: 371 * 162 = 60,102 chips\n\nPlaying Full House twice gives me roughly 20,000 chips initially, then 60,000 on the repeat with both multipliers stacking. The Small Blind threshold of 20,000 should be achievable with just the first hand if I can include all four suits.\n\nTroubadour's +2 hand size boost means I'm drawing 10 cards per round, making it much more likely to assemble all four suits. The Boss Blind presents a real obstacle though—it debuffs all Diamonds, which breaks my Flower Pot requirement since I need every suit represented. Even though debuffed cards still count toward hand formation and don't block the multiplier entirely, losing Diamond chip values means I can't activate the X3 from Flower Pot.\n\nActually, rereading the rules: debuffed cards maintain their suit identity for hand composition purposes. So a debuffed Diamond still counts as a Diamond. If I can play all four suits despite the debuff, Flower Pot activates and I get the X3 multiplier applied to my remaining chip sources—the X9 from my second play should carry me to 40,000.\n\nThe Juggle Tag decision hinges on whether the extra hand size next round outweighs skipping this Small Blind entirely. Three more cards would significantly improve my odds of assembling Full Houses and finding all four suits, but I'd lose the immediate chips and momentum from playing through this round.\n\nFor Big Blind, Polychrome Tag is tempting—a free X1.5 multiplier joker would be powerful. But I'm already at capacity with five jokers, so I'd need to sacrifice something valuable just to slot it in. The 30,000 chip threshold seems manageable with what I have.\n\nI'll proceed through both blinds normally.","action":"\"play_round\""}
