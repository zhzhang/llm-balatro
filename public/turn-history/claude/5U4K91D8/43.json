{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6 (Blind Select phase)\n- Current Blind: Big Blind - 3000 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Upcoming Blind: Boss - 4000 chips needed, $5 reward\n- Boss Description: \"All face cards are drawn face down\" (This is The Goad)\n- Money: $2\n- Tag for skipping Big Blind: Buffoon Tag (gives a free Mega Buffoon Pack)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (52 cards × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Allows duplicates in shop\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if hand already played this round\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Two Pair: Level 4, Base Chips 80, Base Mult 5 (my main hand)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet me calculate if I can beat the Big Blind (3000 chips):\n\nWith Two Pair at Level 4:\n- Base: 80 chips, 5 mult\n- Blue Joker: +104 chips\n- If I hold a Queen: +13 mult from Shoot the Moon\n- Playing cards in Two Pair: ~40-50 chips depending on ranks\n\nFirst Two Pair play:\n- Chips: 80 (base) + 104 (Blue Joker) + ~40-50 (cards) = ~224-234 chips\n- Mult: 5 (base) + 13 (Shoot the Moon if holding Queen) = 18 mult\n- Total: ~234 × 18 = ~4,212 chips\n\nThat's already enough to beat 3000 chips in ONE hand! And with Card Sharp, if I play Two Pair again:\n\n\n- Same chip calculation\n- Mult gets ×3 from Card Sharp\n- Total: ~234 × (18 × 3) = ~234 × 54 = ~12,636 chips\n\nI can EASILY beat this Big Blind.\n\n**Should I skip for the Buffoon Tag?**\n\nThe Buffoon Tag gives a free Mega Buffoon Pack, which lets me choose 2 jokers from up to 5 options. This could be very valuable, especially since I'm at max jokers and might find better synergies.\n\nHowever, looking at the Boss Blind ahead: \"All face cards are drawn face down\" means I can't see Queens or other face cards, which directly hurts my Shoot the Moon strategy since I won't know which Queens I'm holding. This makes the upcoming Boss significantly harder to handle.\n\nIf I skip now, I get the Buffoon Tag but miss the $4 reward and any interest gains. If I play, I earn $4 plus potential interest ($1 per $5), giving me more capital for shopping before facing that difficult Boss Blind. The extra money might matter more than the free joker pack since I'm already at max capacity.","action":"\"play_round\""}
