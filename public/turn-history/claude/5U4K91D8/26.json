{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $3\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (2 chips per card in deck, currently 52 cards)\n  2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n  3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n- Max Jokers: 5 (2 slots available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (both slots available)\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed, $4 reward\n- If skip: Uncommon Tag (Shop has a free Uncommon Joker)\n- Upcoming Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed, Play only 1 hand type this round\n\n**Performance History:**\nMy last hand scored 3,060 chips against 800 needed. My Two Pair hands have been scoring:\n- 3,060 chips (most recent, Small Blind)\n- 728 chips (Boss Blind)\n- 462 chips (Big Blind)\n- 104-108 chips (earlier Small Blinds)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe question is: Should I play the Big Blind for $4, or skip it for an Uncommon Tag that gives a free Uncommon Joker?\n\nPros of playing:\n- I get $4 immediately\n- I'm confident I can beat 1200 chips (I just scored 3,060)\n- I move forward in the game\n- I don't lose any hands/discards\n\nPros of skipping:\n- Free Uncommon Joker (worth likely $5-8 in shop)\n- Uncommon jokers are generally stronger than Common\n- I keep my current money and can potentially buy something better in the next shop\n\n\n- No risk of failure\n\nMy current setup is strong and I'm scoring well above what's needed. The Boss Blind's single hand type restriction actually works in my favor since I've been playing Two Pair exclusively anyway. But the Uncommon Tag is valuable—a free Uncommon Joker could meaningfully strengthen my build, especially with two open joker slots and Showman improving future shop options.\n\nSince I'm comfortably hitting chip targets, the free Uncommon Joker is worth more than the $4 ante, and the Boss Blind won't constrain my strategy, I should take the skip to secure the tag.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
