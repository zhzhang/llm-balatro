{"reasoning":"I'm in the TAROT_PACK step and need to choose one of three tarot cards:\n\n1. **The Hanged Man** - Destroys up to 2 selected cards\n2. **Judgement** - Creates a random Joker card (Must have room)\n3. **The World** - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Spades\n\nLet me analyze my current situation:\n\n**My Jokers (5/5 slots full):**\n1. Blue Joker: +86 Chips (based on deck size, down from +106)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand\n\n**Current Hand (10 cards due to Troubadour):**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n3. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n4. 2 of Spades (+2 chips)\n5. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n7. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n8. 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n9. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n10. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**My Strategy:**\n- Two Pair has been my main hand (Level 4, 80 base chips, 5 base mult)\n- Card Sharp gives X3 mult when I play the same hand type twice\n\n**Analyzing Options:**\n\n1. **The Hanged Man** - Destroys up to 2 selected cards\n   - This could be useful for deck thinning to make it easier to draw specific cards\n   - But deck reduction actually hurts my Blue Joker, which scales with deck size and is already down from +106 to +86\n   - Not aligned with my current build\n\n2. **Judgement** - Creates a random Joker card\n   - My joker slots are completely full at 5/5\n   - Can't use this without selling an existing joker first\n   - Not an option right now\n\n3. **The World** - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Spades\n   - I already have 4 Spades in hand, so converting 3 more cards would give me 7 Spades total\n   - This could support a Flush strategy, but Flush is only Level 1 with weak payouts compared to my Level 4 Two Pair\n   - Switching strategies mid-run would be inefficient\n\nAll three options create problems. Judgement is blocked by full joker slots, The Hanged Man weakens my Blue Joker, and The World would require abandoning my current Two Pair focus. The safest move is to skip this booster and protect my existing strategy.","action":"\"skip_booster\""}
