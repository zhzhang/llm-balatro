Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\\n2. King of Spades (+10 chips)\\n3. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\\n4. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\\n5. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\\n6. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\\n9. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\\n\\n**My Jokers:**\\n1. Blue Joker: +66 Chips\\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\\n\\n**Available Hands:**\\n- I have 2 Aces (positions 1, 3)\\n- I have 3 Kings (positions 2, 4, 7)\\n- This gives me a FULL HOUSE! Three Kings and Two Aces!\\n\\n**Full House Analysis:**\\n\\nFull House is at Level 5:\\n- Base chips: 140\\n- Base mult: 12\\n\\n**First Full House play (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 7):**\\n- Base chips: 140\\n- Card chips from the 5 cards: 11 + 10 + 11 + 10 + 10 = 52\\n\\n\\n- Blue Joker: +66\\n- Total chips: 258\\n- Base mult: 12\\n- Card Sharp doesn't activate (first play)\\n- Total: 258 \\u00d7 12 = 3,096 chips\\n\\nAfter this play, Full House will drop to Level 4 due to boss effect. The second Full House play would yield around 227 chips before multiplier at Level 4, with the Blue Joker contributing roughly 60 chips after some cards are drawn. With a base multiplier of 10 at that level, I'm looking at approximately 2,270 chips from the second hand.\\n\\nHowever, Card Sharp activates on the second play, tripling the multiplier to 30. This brings the second hand to 227 \\u00d7 30 = 6,810 chips. Combined with the first play, that's 3,096 + 6,810 = 9,906 chips total\\u2014still potentially short of the target.\\n\\nI should verify the exact Full House level progression. The metadata shows Level 5 at 140 chips and 12 multiplier, so Level 4 would be slightly lower. Let me recalculate with the specific card values to ensure accuracy. 6,810 = 9,906 chips total. I'm just under the 10,000 threshold, but Space Joker's 25% upgrade chance could push me over, and my Blue Joker estimate might be conservative. Since I have three Kings and two Aces forming a Full House\\u2014my strongest available hand\\u2014I should play it with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.\\n\\nPlaying this Full House gives me roughly 3,096 chips on the first hand. If I advance to a second play after the boss effect, the Level 4 hand would score around 6,810 chips with Card Sharp's multiplier boost, though some chip values will shift as cards get drawn.\\n\\nThat puts me near 9,900 chips total\\u2014close enough to 10,000 that I should proceed with this strategy and hope Space Joker triggers an upgrade or I get a favorable draw.\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 7 full house 3100\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 81]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Blue Joker.

Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\\n\\n**Available Hands in Current Hand:**\\n- Two 5s (positions 2, 4) - Pair\\n- Two 2s (positions 5, 10) - Pair\\n- Four Diamonds (positions 7, 8, 9, 10) - Not enough for flush\\n- No straights, no three of a kind, no full house\\n\\nThe best I can make is:\\n- Two Pair: 5s and 2s\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\nI just played a Full House and scored 3,096 chips. \\n\\nWith 6,904 chips still needed across 2 hands, I'm in a tight spot. The Full House I played is now at Level 5, and while the boss will downgrade it if I play it again, I don't have the cards to form another one anyway. My only viable options are a Pair or Two Pair, and since I've already played Full House this round, Card Sharp would give me a x3 multiplier if I could repeat it\\u2014but my current cards won't allow that.\\n\\nTwo Pair sits at Level 4 with 80 base chips and 5x multiplier, and crucially, I haven't played it yet this round, so Card Sharp won't trigger. Let me calculate what Two Pair would score with my available cards.\\n\\nPlaying Two Pair with positions 2, 4, 5, 10 gives me 80 base chips plus 14 from the cards themselves, and Blue Joker adds 56 for a total of 150 chips times the 5x multiplier\\u2014that's 750 points. After the boss effect downgrades it to Level 3, the second Two Pair would have roughly 55 base chips, the same 14 card chips, and Blue Joker contributing around 50, bringing it to about 119 chips. This time Card Sharp activates for 3x multiplier on the 4x base, giving me 12x total\\u2014roughly 1,428 points on the second play.\\n\\nCombined, that's 2,178 chips added to my current 3,096, totaling 5,274\\u2014still short of what I need. I should explore discarding to find better cards instead. The remaining deck has one King, one Ace, and various suits spread across the remaining cards. I could pursue a pair of Aces, trips, a straight, or a flush depending on what I draw.\\n\\nWith only two hands left and limited discards, I need to calculate whether any realistic draw could close the gap of 6,904 chips. Getting another Ace would give me a pair worth more, and drawing three of a kind would significantly boost my score. Let me work through the probabilities with 28 cards remaining in the deck.\\n\\nMy best strategy is to discard the weakest cards and keep the highest-value ones. I'll hold onto the Ace of Clubs, Jack of Hearts, and 10 of Spades, then discard the 5 of Spades, 5 of Hearts, 2 of Hearts, 6 of Diamonds, and 4 of Diamonds. This maximizes my chances of drawing cards that either form stronger combinations or have higher individual values.\\nCommand: discard 2 4 5 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 82]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Blue Joker.

Since Two Pair hasn't been played yet this round, Card Sharp won't trigger. With a base multiplier of 5, this scores 810 chips.\\n\\nAfter playing Two Pair, the Boss Blind will downgrade it to Level 3. If I can form it again with my second hand, I'd be working with 55 base chips at the reduced level, plus whatever card values I draw, and roughly 40 from the Blue Joker. That would give me around 95 chips before applying the 4x multiplier.\\n\\nHowever, Card Sharp would activate on the second play since Two Pair was already played this round, multiplying by 3 for a total of 12x. This second Two Pair would yield approximately 1,140 chips. Combined with the first play, that's 1,950 chips total\\u2014bringing my score to 5,046 chips, which still falls short of the target.\\n\\nI should explore other hand possibilities. Looking at my cards\\u201410, 9 of Spades, Jack of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 8 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds, 2 of Diamonds\\u2014I could potentially form a straight if I can find five consecutive ranks. ,000 chips, which combined with current 3,096 = 8,096 - still not enough!\\n\\nWait, I already played a Full House this round, so Card Sharp activates on a repeat. First Full House nets 2,832 chips, and the second one at Level 4 with the Card Sharp multiplier gives 6,480 chips, totaling 9,312. That brings me to 12,408 chips combined - enough to win. The challenge is whether I can actually construct another Full House with my remaining cards.\\n\\nI have two 10s and two 8s, needing one more card to complete a three-of-a-kind. The deck still has two 8s available but no more 10s, so drawing another 8 is possible but unlikely with only 23 cards remaining. Alternatively, I notice I'm holding Jack, 10, 9, and 8 - if I draw a 7, I'd complete a straight. Three 7s are still in the deck, making that a more probable outcome than getting the third 8.\\n\\nA straight would score 480 chips with my current setup, which still falls short. My best path forward is pursuing a Full House by keeping my pair of 10s and pair of 8s, then discarding the lower cards to draw into a third matching card.\\n\\nI'll keep the 10s, 8s, and Ace, discarding the 9, Jack, 4, 3, and 2. That gives me five cards to discard and a chance to hit either another 10 or 8 to complete the Full House.\\nCommand: discard 2 3 5 9 10\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 4/8, Round: 11\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Blue Joker.
