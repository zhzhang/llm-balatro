{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 3,096\n- Remaining chips needed: 6,904\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 0 (used all discards)\n- Boss Effect: Decrease level of played poker hand\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n4. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n5. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n6. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips, Gold Card)\n7. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n8. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n9. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n10. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**Available Hands:**\n- Three 8s (positions 3, 8, 9) - Three of a Kind\n- Two 10s (positions 1, 2) - Pair\n- Full House: Three 8s and Two 10s (positions 1, 2, 3, 8, 9)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +36 Chips\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\nI have a FULL HOUSE! Three 8s and two 10s!\n\nSince I already played Full House this round (3,096 chips was scored with it), Card Sharp will activate on the next Full House I play, giving me X3 multiplier.\n\n\nPlaying the Full House again: Level 5 gives 140 base chips and 12 base mult. The five cards contribute 44 chips total, plus 36 from Blue Joker, reaching 220 chips. Card Sharp triggers for X3 mult on the repeated hand, bringing total multiplier to 36.\n\nThis scores 220 × 36 = 7,920 chips. Combined with my current 3,096, I'd hit 11,016 chips—surpassing the 10,000 target. The boss effect that downgrades Full House to Level 4 applies after scoring, so this calculation holds for the current play. a Full House with three 8s and two 10s.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,8,9]"}
