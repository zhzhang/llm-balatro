{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12\n- Chips Needed: 16,500\n- Current Chips: 14,686\n- Chips still needed: 16,500 - 14,686 = 1,814\n- Remaining hands: 1\n- Remaining discards: 1\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n2. King of Hearts (+10 chips)\n3. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n4. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n9. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n10. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +38 Chips (19 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Showman\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice this round (ACTIVE! I've already played Full House twice)\n5. Space Joker - 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level\n\n**Available Hands:**\nLooking at my cards:\n- Three Kings: King of Hearts (2), King of Clubs (4), King of Diamonds (7) = THREE OF A KIND\n- Two 4s: 4 of Hearts (3), 4 of Diamonds (8) = PAIR\n\nThis gives me a FULL HOUSE! Three Kings + Two 4s\n\nSince I've already played Full House TWICE this round (the last two hands were both Full Houses), Card Sharp's X3 mult will trigger again!\n\n\nPlaying this Full House will score 165 base chips plus 38 from the card values and another 38 from Blue Joker, totaling 241 chips. With the Card Sharp multiplier tripling the base 14x to 42x, that's 241 × 42 = 10,122 chips. Adding this to my current 14,686 gives me 24,808 chips—well above the 16,500 target.\n\nI'm selecting the Kings and 4s: positions 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,7,8]"}
