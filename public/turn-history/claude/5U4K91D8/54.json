{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 8\n- Boss Blind: \"All face cards are drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 3672\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 3\n\n**Progress:**\nI need 4000 - 3672 = 328 more chips to win this round.\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n2: Unknown (face down)\n3: 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n4: 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n5: Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n6: 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n7: 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n8: 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n9: 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n10: 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Visible Cards Analysis:**\nI can see FOUR 8s! Positions 1, 3, 6, 10 are all 8s (Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds)\n\nThis is FOUR OF A KIND!\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +70 Chips (35 cards remaining × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand (useless due to face-down cards)\n3. Showman: Shop duplicates (not relevant in round)\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\n**Key Insight:**\nCard Sharp is ACTIVE because I've already played Two Pair once this round. However, Card Sharp only activates if I play the SAME hand type again. \n\nFour of a Kind won't trigger Card Sharp since I haven't played that hand type yet this round. The multiplier only applies to hands I've already used. For Four of a Kind at Level 1, I'm looking at base chips of 60 and base mult of 7, with the four 8s contributing 32 chips total.\n\nAdding Blue Joker's 70 chips gives me 162 chips × 7 mult = 1,134 points. Combined with my previous score, that reaches 4,806 chips—well above what I need to advance.\n\nTwo Pair is another option since I have four 8s available, though I'd need to find a second pair among the remaining cards to make it work.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,3,6,10]"}
