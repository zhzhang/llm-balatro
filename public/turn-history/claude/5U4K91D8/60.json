{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 8\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $2\n- I'm halfway through the run (Ante 4 of 8)\n\n**My Jokers (5/5 slots full):**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips (based on deck size)\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times in shop\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played poker hand\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Saturn (Planet): Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips. Cost: $3\n- Zany Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains Three of a Kind. Cost: $4\n- Tarot Merchant (Voucher): Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently. Cost: $10\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**My Strategy:**\n- Two Pair is my main hand (Level 4, 80 base chips, 5 base mult, played 10 times)\n- Card Sharp gives X3 mult when I play the same hand type twice in a round\n- This has been very effective so far\n\n**Analysis:**\nWith only $2, I cannot afford:\n- Saturn ($3)\n- Zany Joker ($4)\n- Tarot Merchant ($10)\n- Reroll ($5)\n\nI have no viable purchase options. Since I just finished the tarot pack selection and skipped it, I'm back in the shop with very limited funds.\n\nThe best action is to proceed to the next round (round_select) and save my $2. In the next round, I should be able to:\n\n\nEarn $1 per remaining hand (Troubadour gives me 4 hands - 1 = 3 hands typically), which combined with my current funds should give me enough to afford something useful. Moving forward without spending now makes sense since nothing here fits my budget.","action":"\"round_select\""}
