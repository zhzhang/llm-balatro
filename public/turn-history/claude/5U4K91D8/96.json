{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 12 (just finished Big Blind, ready for Boss Blind next)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $15\n- Joker slots: 4/5 (just sold Space Joker)\n- Consumable slots: 0/2\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n1. Astronomer ($8) - Makes all Planet cards and Celestial Packs free\n2. Square Joker ($4) - Gains +4 chips per 4-card hand (not useful with my strategy)\n3. Jumbo Celestial Pack ($6)\n4. Jumbo Standard Pack ($6)\n5. Seed Money voucher ($10)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n\n**Strategy:**\nI just sold Space Joker and now have $15. My plan was to:\n1. Buy Astronomer for $8 (leaving me with $7)\n2. Then buy the Jumbo Celestial Pack which will be FREE due to Astronomer\n\nThis is a great combo because:\n- Astronomer makes all planet cards and celestial packs free\n- I can then get the Jumbo Celestial Pack for free\n- This will let me level up Full House even more for the Boss Blind\n- Full House is already at Level 7 (190 base chips, 16 base mult), and leveling it up more will help me beat the Boss Blind\n\nLet me proceed with buying Astronomer first.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
