{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 8\n- Boss Blind: \"All face cards are drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 3672\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**Progress:**\nI need 4000 chips and already have 3672, so I need only 328 more chips to win this round.\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1: Unknown (face down)\n2: Unknown (face down)\n3: 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n4: Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5: Unknown (face down)\n6: 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\n7: 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n8: 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n9: Unknown (face down)\n10: 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +78 Chips (39 cards remaining × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand (useless due to face-down cards)\n3. Showman: Shop duplicates (not relevant in round)\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\n**Key Insight:**\nCard Sharp is now ACTIVE because I've already played Two Pair once this round. This means my next Two Pair will get X3 Mult!\n\n**Analysis:**\nI just played Two Pair and earned 3,672 chips. I need only 328 more chips to reach 4000.\n\nWith Card Sharp active (X3 Mult), I need to find another Two Pair to play.\n\nLooking at visible cards:\n- 5 of Hearts\n\n\n- Ace of Clubs\n- 8 of Clubs\n- 7 of Clubs\n- 2 of Clubs\n- 9 of Diamonds\n\nI don't see any obvious pairs in the visible cards. The face-down cards could be anything. \n\nLet me think about my options:\n1. Discard to try to find pairs\n2. Play whatever hand I can make now\n\nSince I only need 328 more chips and Card Sharp gives me X3 Mult, even a weak hand might be enough. Let me calculate what I'd get with different hands: High Card would give me 5 chips × 1 mult, which isn't nearly enough, but if I can construct a Two Pair or better hand, the X3 multiplier from Card Sharp could easily push me over the threshold. Total: 198 × 15 = 2,970 chips (more than enough).\n\nTwo Pair with Card Sharp is the key to reaching my goal. The challenge is that four cards are face-down, so I can't see what they are. I could discard them to draw new cards and try to build pairs, though there's risk if the draw doesn't help. Alternatively, some of those unknown cards might already match each other or the visible ones, giving me the pairs I need without discarding.\n\nWith 2 hands and 4 discards remaining, I have room to experiment. Since I only need 328 chips and Card Sharp multiplies Two Pair significantly, my best move is to discard all four face-down cards and draw from the remaining deck, hoping to hit matching cards. I'll discard positions 1, 2, 5, and 9.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,9]"}
