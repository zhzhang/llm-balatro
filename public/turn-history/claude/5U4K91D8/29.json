{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Spades - +9 chips\n2. 6 of Spades - +6 chips\n3. Ace of Hearts - +11 chips\n4. 4 of Hearts - +4 chips\n5. Queen of Clubs (Gold Card) - +10 chips, $3 if held at end of round\n6. Jack of Clubs - +10 chips\n7. Jack of Diamonds - +10 chips\n8. 6 of Diamonds - +6 chips\n\n**Pairs in hand:**\n- Pair of Jacks (positions 6 and 7)\n- Pair of 6s (positions 2 and 8)\n\n**Perfect! I have TWO PAIR!**\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +78 chips (39 cards left in deck × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n\n**Boss Constraint:** Play only 1 hand type this round. I've been playing Two Pair exclusively, so this works perfectly.\n\n**Calculating the hand:**\nI should play the two pairs: Jacks (positions 6, 7) and 6s (positions 2, 8), and hold the Queen of Clubs to trigger Shoot the Moon.\n\nLet me calculate chips:\n- Two Pair Level 3: Base 60 chips, Base 4 mult\n- Cards that participate in the hand: Jack of Clubs (+10), Jack of Diamonds (+10), 6 of Spades (+6), 6 of Diamonds (+6)\n- Total from played cards: 10 + 10 + 6 + 6 = 32 chips\n- Blue Joker: +78 chips\n- Total chips: 60 + 32 + 78 = 170 chips\n\n\n- Multiplier from base hand: 4\n- Shoot the Moon bonus from held Queen: +13 mult\n- Final multiplier: 17\n- Total score: 170 × 17 = 2,890 chips\n\nThis far exceeds the 1,600 needed. I'll play positions 2, 6, 7, 8 for the two pairs and keep the Queen since it provides both the $3 bonus and the crucial +13 mult multiplier.\n\nThe other cards—9 of Spades, Ace of Hearts, 4 of Hearts—don't offer any special triggers, so holding just the Queen maximizes my score. Playing the two Jacks and two 6s gives me the Two Pair hand type I need.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,6,7,8]"}
