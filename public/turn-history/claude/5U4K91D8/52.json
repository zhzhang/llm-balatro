{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 8\n- Boss Blind: \"All face cards are drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n\n**Hand:**\n1: Unknown (face down - likely a face card)\n2: 10 of Spades\n3: 9 of Spades\n4: 9 of Hearts\n5: Unknown (face down - likely a face card)\n6: 8 of Clubs\n7: 2 of Clubs\n8: Unknown (face down - likely a face card)\n9: 10 of Diamonds\n10: 9 of Diamonds\n\n**Visible Cards:**\n- Two 10s (Spades, Diamonds)\n- Three 9s (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds)\n- One 8 (Clubs)\n- One 2 (Clubs)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +86 Chips (43 cards remaining × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand (but Queens are face down, so this won't work)\n3. Showman: Shop duplicates\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n5. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need 4000 chips total with only 3 hands. My Two Pair is Level 4 with Base Chips 80 and Base Mult 5.\n\nLooking at my visible cards, I can see:\n- Pair of 10s (positions 2, 9)\n- Three 9s (positions 3, 4, 10) - could make three of a kind or use two for a pair\n\n\n- The three face-down cards are likely face cards (J, Q, K) that won't contribute chip values due to the debuff, though they can still form hands.\n\nI'm weighing whether to play the Two Pair (my strongest hand at Level 4) or the Three of a Kind with the three 9s. The Two Pair gives me 80 base chips and 5 base mult, while Three of a Kind would be Level 1 with much lower values.\n\nLet me work through the Two Pair calculation: 80 base chips plus 38 from the cards themselves (the two 10s and two 9s) plus 86 from Blue Joker equals 204 chips. With a base mult of 5, that's 1,020 chips total—not enough to reach my goal. I need to leverage Card Sharp by playing the hand multiple times to build up the multiplier bonus.\n\nIf I play Two Pair once for roughly 1,020 chips, then play it again with Card Sharp active, I'd get 204 × 5 × 3 = 3,060 chips on the second play, bringing my total to around 4,080 chips. That should work. The challenge is whether I can actually form two separate Two Pairs from my available cards. I have two 10s and three 9s visible, so I can definitely make one Two Pair. For the second hand, I'll need to draw fresh cards after my first play and hope to form another pair combination from what comes up.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,9]"}
