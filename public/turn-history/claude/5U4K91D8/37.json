{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 3/8, Round 6\n- Small Blind: Need 2000 chips\n- Remaining Hands: 3\n- Remaining Discards: 3\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Current Money: $6\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +74 chips (37 cards left in deck × 2)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n4. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n\n**Current Hand (10 cards):**\n1. 8 of Spades - +8 chips\n2. 4 of Spades - +4 chips\n3. King of Hearts - +10 chips\n4. King of Clubs - +10 chips\n5. 10 of Clubs - +10 chips\n6. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\n7. 6 of Clubs - +6 chips\n8. King of Diamonds - +10 chips\n9. 10 of Diamonds - +10 chips\n10. 9 of Diamonds - +9 chips\n\n**Available Hand Types:**\n- Three of a Kind: Kings (positions 3, 4, 8)\n- Two Pair: Kings and 10s (positions 3, 4, 8 and 5, 9)\n- Two Pair: Kings and 9s (positions 3, 4, 8 and 6, 10)\n- Pair of 10s (positions 5, 9)\n- Pair of 9s (positions 6, 10)\n\n**Deck Remaining (37 cards):**\n- 4 Queens still in deck\n- 1 King remaining\n\n\n- Three Kings in hand is a strong play. The Blue Joker adds significant chip value, and I should calculate the total score for this hand type. Three of a Kind gives 30 base chips with 3 multiplier, plus the three Kings contribute 30 chips, and the Blue Joker adds 74 chips for a total of 134 chips before applying multiplier.\n\nHowever, this only reaches 402 chips total—far short of the 2000 needed. I need Queens to trigger Shoot the Moon for a real score boost.\n\nTwo Pair using the Kings and 10s is another option. This hand type provides better base multiplier at 4x, and combining the four cards gives 40 chips plus the 60 base and 74 from Blue Joker for 174 chips before multiplier.\n\nMultiplying by 4 gives 696 chips—still insufficient without Queens in my hand.\n\nSince Shoot the Moon requires Queens and I have none, I should discard more cards to hunt for them. With 4 Queens among the remaining 37 cards, there's roughly an 11% chance per draw. Discarding 5 more cards gives me a reasonable shot at finding at least one. I'd drop the low-value cards like the 8 of Spades, 4 of Spades, and 6 of Clubs while keeping the Kings and one pair to maintain flexibility. I need to focus on drawing Queens since that's essential for Shoot the Moon. Keeping the three Kings is solid, but I should reconsider what else stays in my hand. Discarding cards 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9 leaves me with the Kings and a pair of 9s—giving me flexibility to make Two Pair if the Queens don't come through.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,7,9]"}
