{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 10\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $2\n- I'm about to face the Boss Blind (Round 10 is a Boss round)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +106 Chips\n2. Showman: Cards appear multiple times\n3. Troubadour: +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. Card Sharp: X3 Mult if played poker hand has already been played this round\n5. Space Joker: 1 in 4 chance to upgrade level of played hand\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 5 (140 base chips, 12 base mult) - played 4 times\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 base chips, 5 base mult) - played 13 times\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Sly Joker: +50 Chips if played hand contains a Pair - $3\n- Saturn (Planet): Level up Straight +3 Mult and +30 chips - $3\n- Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards - $4\n- Tarot Merchant Voucher: Tarot cards appear 2X more frequently - $10\n- Current Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $2, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop:\n- Sly Joker costs $3\n- Saturn costs $3\n- Arcana Pack costs $4\n- Tarot Merchant costs $10\n- Reroll costs $5\n\nI've just successfully upgraded Full House to Level 5, which is now a very strong hand (140 chips, 12 mult base). Combined with my Blue Joker (+106 chips), Card Sharp (X3 mult when repeating hands), and other jokers, I should be able to handle the Boss Blind.\n\n\nSince I can't afford anything and I'm at max jokers with no consumables to sell, there's nothing left to do here. I'll move forward to the Boss Blind using the `round_select` command.","action":"\"round_select\""}
