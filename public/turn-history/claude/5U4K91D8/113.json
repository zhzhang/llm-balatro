{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 13\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $9\n- I just sold Showman and now have 4 jokers (max 5)\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +106 Chips\n2. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n3. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n4. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n\n**Shop:**\n- Flower Pot: X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits - $6\n- Runner: Gains +15 Chips per Straight played - $5\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards - $6\n- Paint Brush voucher: +1 hand size - $10\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI've been playing Full House exclusively and it's now Level 8 (215 base chips, 18 base mult). My last action was selling Showman to make room for Flower Pot, which would give me X3 mult when I have all 4 suits in a hand.\n\nWith Card Sharp's X3 mult on repeated hands and Flower Pot's X3 mult for all 4 suits, I'd get a X9 multiplicative effect on qualifying hands!\n\nNow I have:\n- $9 money\n- Space for 1 more joker (4/5)\n- Flower Pot costs $6\n\nI should buy Flower Pot now to complete the plan I started with.\n\nLet me calculate the potential:\n- Full House base: 215 chips, 18 mult\n- Blue Joker: +106 chips = 321 chips\n- Plus chips from the 5 cards played (let's say ~50 chips average) = ~371 chips\n\n\n- Card Sharp: X3 mult on second play = 18 * 3 = 54 mult\n- Flower Pot: X3 mult if all 4 suits = 54 * 3 = 162 mult\n- Total: 371 * 162 = 60,102 chips!\n\nThis synergy is too good to pass up. The command should be: buy_card 1","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
