{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nCurrent hand:\n1: 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n2: 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n3: Queen of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4: 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n5: 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n6: 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n7: 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n8: 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\nI need 300 chips total, and I have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining.\n\nLet me look for possible hands:\n- Pair of 3s: positions 2 and 5 (3 of Spades and 3 of Clubs)\n- Pair of 4s: positions 1 and 8 (4 of Spades and 4 of Diamonds)\n- No straights visible\n- No flushes (need 5 cards of same suit)\n- No higher value hands\n\nLet me calculate potential scores:\n\nOption 1: Play pair of 4s (positions 1 and 8)\n- Base chips for Pair: 10\n- Chips from 4 of Spades: +4\n- Chips from 4 of Diamonds: +4\n- Total chips: 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 chips\n- Base mult for Pair: 2\n- Total: 18 × 2 = 36 chips\n\nOption 2: Play pair of 3s (positions 2 and 5)\n- Base chips for Pair: 10\n- Chips from 3 of Spades: +3\n- Chips from 3 of Clubs: +3\n- Total chips: 10 + 3 + 3 = 16 chips\n- Base mult for Pair: 2\n\n\n- Total: 16 × 2 = 32 chips\n\nBoth options fall far short of 300 chips. I need to discard strategically and draw into stronger hands. With 4 discards left, I have room to search for better combinations—ideally three of a kind, straights, or flushes. I'll hold onto the pairs as a baseline and discard the isolated low-value cards to improve my chances.\n\nReconsidering my approach: without jokers, I need solid poker hands to hit 300 chips. A high flush works—playing five cards from 10 to Ace gives roughly (35 + 50) × 4 = 340 chips. A straight could also work depending on the card values involved. - (30 + card chips) × 3\n  - Low trips like trip 3s: (30 + 12) × 3 = 126 chips - insufficient\n  - Even high trips like trip Kings: (30 + 30) × 3 = 180 chips - still falls short\n\nI need to pivot toward building a flush or straight instead. Looking at my cards by suit: I have three diamonds (7, 6, 4) which gives me the strongest flush draw with 10 remaining diamonds in the deck. For straights, my options are limited since I'm holding mostly low cards and duplicates. I should discard the cards that don't support either of these hands - the spade pair and the Queen of hearts aren't helping me progress toward either goal.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
