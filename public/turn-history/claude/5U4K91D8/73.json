{"reasoning":"I'm in a Mega Celestial Pack selection phase, where I can choose 2 of 5 planet cards. Let me analyze the options:\n\n**Available Planet Cards:**\n1. Venus - Level up Three of a Kind +2 Mult and +20 chips\n2. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips  \n3. Uranus (lvl.4) - Level up Two Pair +1 Mult and +20 chips\n4. Earth (lvl.3) - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips\n5. Earth (lvl.3) - Level up Full House +2 Mult and +25 chips\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 3 (90 base chips, 8 base mult) - played 4 times\n- Two Pair: Level 4 (80 base chips, 5 base mult) - played 13 times\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (30 base chips, 3 base mult) - played 0 times\n- High Card: Level 1 (5 base chips, 1 base mult) - played 0 times\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent gameplay history, I've been primarily playing:\n1. Full House (4 times) - my most recent strategy\n2. Two Pair (13 times) - heavily used throughout\n\nThe last played hands show:\n- Full House scoring between 1,086 to 4,800 chips\n- Two Pair scoring between 1,040 to 8,640 chips\n\nWith my joker setup (especially Card Sharp giving X3 mult when repeating hands), I need to focus on hands I actually play.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n1. **Venus (Three of a Kind)**: I've never played Three of a Kind, so this doesn't fit my strategy.\n\n2. **Pluto (High Card)**: Also never played, not relevant.\n\n\n3. **Uranus (Two Pair)**: Upgrading my most-played hand from Level 4 to Level 5 would boost it to 100 base chips and 6 base mult. Since I've relied on Two Pair 13 times, this is a solid incremental improvement.\n\n4. **Earth (Full House) x2**: With two copies available, I could push Full House from Level 3 to Level 5. Each upgrade adds +2 Mult and +25 chips, making this a significant power spike for my recent primary hand.\n\nThe real question is whether to double down on Full House or diversify by strengthening both hands. Picking both Earths would give Full House 140 chips and 12 mult—a massive jump from its current 90 chips and 8 mult. Alternatively, taking one Earth and Uranus would moderately improve both hands. Given that Full House synergizes exceptionally well with Card Sharp's X3 multiplier and has been my scoring engine lately, concentrating the upgrades there seems more impactful than spreading them across two hands.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [4]"}
