{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 5/8, Round: 13\n- Boss Blind: All Heart cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 22,000\n- Current Chips: 4,736\n- Chips still needed: 22,000 - 4,736 = 17,264\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 2\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n2. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n3. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n4. Ace of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n5. 10 of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n6. 7 of Hearts (DEBUFFED - scores no chips)\n7. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n8. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n9. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n10. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - Currently +56 Chips (2 per card remaining in deck)\n2. Showman - Allows duplicates in shop\n3. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand each round\n4. **Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice (ACTIVE for Full House!)**\n5. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n\n**Possible Hands:**\nLooking at my current hand:\n- Three 10s: 10 of Hearts (debuffed), 10 of Clubs, 10 of Diamonds\n- Three 7s: 7 of Spades, 7 of Hearts (debuffed), 7 of Diamonds\n\nI can make a **Full House** with:\n- Three 10s (positions 5, 7, 9) + Two 7s (positions 2, 10) OR\n\n\n- Three 7s (positions 2, 6, 10) + Two 10s (positions 7, 9)\n\nNow I need to evaluate which Full House configuration scores higher. The first option uses the debuffed 10 of Hearts as one of the three, while the second uses the debuffed 7 of Hearts. Since Card Sharp triples multiplier on repeated hands, and Full House has a base multiplier of 16, the actual scoring difference comes down to which non-debuffed cards contribute to the hand. Option 1 gives me 10 of Clubs and 10 of Diamonds for +20 chips, plus 7 of Spades for +7, totaling +27 contributing chips. Option 2 gives me 10 of Clubs and 10 of Diamonds for +20 chips, plus 7 of Spades for +7, which is the same contribution. of Diamonds: +7\n- 10 of Clubs: +10\n- 10 of Diamonds: +10\n- 7 of Hearts: DEBUFFED (doesn't contribute chips)\n- Total from cards: 7 + 7 + 10 + 10 = 34 chips\n- Blue Joker: +56 chips\n- Total chips: 190 + 34 + 56 = 280 chips\n- Total mult: 16 × 3 = 48\n- Final score: 280 × 48 = 13,440 chips\n\nBoth configurations yield identical results. Adding this to the previous hand gives 4,736 + 13,440 = 18,176 chips total, leaving a gap of 3,824 chips to reach the 22,000 target.\n\nWith one hand remaining, I need to decide whether playing this Full House now makes sense. If I do, I'll have 18,176 chips and need 3,824 more from my final hand. A subsequent Full House wouldn't trigger Card Sharp again since that bonus only fires once per round, but even accounting for the Blue Joker's growth and card values, I could generate around 4,256 chips—enough to clear the threshold.\n\nI'll play the Full House with the three 10s and two 7s.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,5,7,9,10]"}
