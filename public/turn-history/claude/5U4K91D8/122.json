{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 6/8, Round: 15\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND (in the Big Blind)\n- Money: $4\n- Chips Needed: 30,000\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 4\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n2. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n3. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n4. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n5. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips, Gold Card - $3 if held)\n6. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n7. 2 of Clubs (+2 chips)\n8. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n9. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n10. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker - +86 Chips (43 cards remaining in deck)\n2. Troubadour - +2 hand size, -1 hand per round\n3. Card Sharp - X3 Mult if same hand played twice\n4. Astronomer - Free planet cards\n5. Flower Pot - X3 Mult if hand contains all 4 suits\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Full House: Level 9, Base Chips 240, Base Mult 20\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need to look for Full House opportunities since that's my strongest hand type.\n\nCurrent hand possibilities:\n- I have a pair of 8s (8 of Spades, 8 of Hearts)\n- I have a pair of Aces (Ace of Hearts, Ace of Diamonds)\n\nFor a Full House, I need three of a kind + a pair. I currently have two pairs but no three of a kind.\n\nLet me check what I can make:\n\n\nI can't form a Full House with what I'm holding. I should discard strategically to improve my odds. Looking at remaining deck composition, there are 2 eights left, 3 queens, and 3 twos available. I need to decide which cards to discard to maximize my chances of drawing into a three-of-a-kind that pairs with one of my existing pairs. I have all four suits represented in my hand, so Flower Pot is achievable. Looking at my options, I should focus on building toward a Full House since that's stronger than just having the suit requirement. The 3s are the most abundant remaining card with 5 in the deck, making them the best target for trips. I could discard most of my hand to maximize draw chances, keeping perhaps the Gold Queen for the suit coverage it provides.\n\nLet me reconsider my approach more carefully. I'll discard the 9 of Spades, 4 of Clubs, 2 of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds, and 5 of Diamonds, which leaves me with two pairs—the 8s and Aces—plus the Gold Queen. Drawing five fresh cards gives me a solid shot at hitting a third of one of my pairs or completing a Full House. Though I should double-check my card count since the Troubadour's +2 hand size modifier means I'm working with 7 cards normally, not 10.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,6,7,9,10]"}
