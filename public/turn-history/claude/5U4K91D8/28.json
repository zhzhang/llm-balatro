{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 5 (Boss Blind)\n- Boss restriction: Play only 1 hand type this round\n- Chips needed: 1600\n- Current chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current money: $3\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Blue Joker: +88 chips (currently - deck has 44 cards left, so 44*2 = 88)\n2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n3. Showman: Joker/Tarot/Planet/Spectral cards may appear multiple times\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades - +11 chips\n2. 8 of Hearts - +8 chips\n3. Queen of Clubs (Gold Card) - +10 chips, $3 if held at end of round\n4. Jack of Clubs - +10 chips\n5. 9 of Clubs - +9 chips\n6. 3 of Clubs - +3 chips\n7. Jack of Diamonds - +10 chips\n8. 7 of Diamonds - +7 chips\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Pair of Jacks (Jack of Clubs + Jack of Diamonds) - positions 4 and 7\n- No other pairs visible\n- Flush potential: 4 Clubs (Queen, Jack, 9, 3)\n\n**Strategy:**\nI've been playing Two Pair exclusively, and my last hand scored 3,060 chips. The boss requires playing only one hand type, which fits perfectly with my Two Pair strategy.\n\nHowever, I only see ONE pair in my current hand (Jacks). I need to either:\n1. Play the pair of Jacks (but it won't be Two Pair)\n2. Discard to try to find another pair\n\n\n---\n\nIf I play the Pair of Jacks with the Queen of Clubs held, the calculation breaks down as follows: the pair itself gives 10 base chips plus 10 from each Jack for 30 total, multiplied by the base mult of 2. Adding the Blue Joker's 88 chips brings me to 118, and with Shoot the Moon triggering off the Queen for 13 additional mult, I'd reach a total multiplier of 15. That yields 118 × 15 = 1,770 chips, which clears the 1,600 requirement.\n\nHowever, I need to reconsider the constraint—the boss blind locks me into a single hand type for the entire round. Since I've been playing Two Pair, I should continue with that pattern rather than switching. Looking at my current cards, I only have one pair (the Jacks), so I need to discard the unpaired cards and hope to draw another pair. I'll keep the Jacks and the Gold Queen to preserve the Shoot the Moon bonus.\n\nI'll discard five cards: the Ace, 8 of Hearts, 9 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, and 7 of Diamonds. This keeps my Jack pair and Queen while giving me five fresh draws to find a second pair.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,2,5,6,8]"}
