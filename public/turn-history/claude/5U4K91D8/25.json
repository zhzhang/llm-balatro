{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 4 (just finished Small Blind)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $3\n- Owned Jokers:\n  1. Blue Joker: +104 chips (2 chips per card in deck)\n  2. Shoot the Moon: +13 Mult per Queen held in hand\n  3. Showman: Joker, Tarot, Planet, and Spectral cards may appear multiple times (just acquired)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (2 slots available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (both slots available)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Crazy Joker: +12 Mult if played hand contains a Straight - $4\n2. Mega Standard Pack: Choose 2 of 5 playing cards - $8\n3. Jumbo Standard Pack: Choose 1 of 5 playing cards - $6\n4. Blank Voucher: Does nothing? - $10\n5. Reroll: $5\n\n**What I Can Afford:**\nWith $3, I can't afford anything in the shop:\n- Crazy Joker: $4 (need $1 more)\n- Reroll: $5 (need $2 more)\n- All packs and voucher are too expensive\n\n**Upcoming Blinds:**\n- Big Blind: 1200 chips needed (Uncommon Tag if skipped - free Uncommon Joker)\n- Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed (Play only 1 hand type this round)\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n- My Two Pair strategy is working very well (last hand scored 3,060 chips vs 800 needed)\n- Blue Joker and Shoot the Moon are synergizing well\n- Showman is interesting - it makes consumables appear multiple times in shops, which could be valuable\n\n\n- I'm significantly outpacing the required chip thresholds\n\n**Current Decision:**\nSince I can't afford any shop items with my current $3, I should skip the shop and proceed to the Big Blind. My setup is already performing well above what's needed, and both upcoming blinds are manageable with my current Two Pair synergy. Selling a joker would be counterproductive given how effectively they're working together.\n\nThe right move is to advance to the next blind without making any purchases.","action":"\"round_select\""}
