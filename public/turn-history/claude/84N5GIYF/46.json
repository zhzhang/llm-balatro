{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $2\n- I have the Investment Tag now (will give $25 after beating Boss Blind)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- Big Blind: 3000 chips needed, $4 reward\n- Tag for skipping: Handy Tag (gives $1 per played hand this run - will give $10)\n- Boss Blind: 4000 chips needed, $5 reward, All Club cards are debuffed\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent scoring history:\n- Pairs have been scoring 380-1,300 chips\n- Average seems around 500-600 chips per pair\n\nFor 3000 chips:\n- If I average 500 chips per pair, I need 6 hands\n- If I average 600 chips per pair, I need 5 hands\n- My best pair scored 1,200 chips, so with 2-3 good hands I could do it\n\nThe question is: Should I skip Big Blind for the Handy Tag ($10) or play it?\n\n**Option 1: Skip Big Blind**\n- Get Handy Tag: $10 immediately\n- Total money before Boss: $2 + $10 = $12\n- Then face Boss Blind (4000 chips) with Club cards debuffed\n- If I win Boss: $12 + $5 + $1 (Rocket) + $25 (Investment Tag) = $43\n\n\n- Playing Big Blind instead gives me $4 plus Rocket's $1 payout, totaling $5 extra before facing the Boss. That would leave me with $7 total, and after beating the Boss I'd gain another $5 plus Rocket's increased payout of $3 (since it goes up by $2 after defeating a Boss Blind) plus the Investment Tag's $25, bringing me to $40 total.\n\nComparing the two paths: skipping Big Blind nets me $43 after the Boss round with the Handy Tag's $10 boost, while playing Big Blind leaves me at $40. The skip option is stronger by $3, and I keep my Club cards at full strength instead of facing the debuff.\n\nHowever, I'm uncertain whether I can actually accumulate 4000 chips needed for the Boss with my pair-focused strategy generating 380-1,200 per hand. That likely requires 4-8 successful rounds depending on variance. Playing Big first would give me a sense of my scoring ceiling, but it also burns hands and risks the entire run if I fall short.\n\nThe real decision hinges on confidence. My jokers support consistent pair scoring, and the Club debuff only impacts a quarter of my deck. Economically, skipping nets me $5 more. I think I should skip the Big Blind and attempt the Boss directly—the financial edge combined with my solid setup makes it worth the risk.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
