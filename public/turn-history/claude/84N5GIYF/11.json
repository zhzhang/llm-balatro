{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Boss Blind\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Boss Description: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\n- Reward: $5\n- Money: $4\n- Owned Jokers: Drunkard (+1 discard each round)\n\n**Key Information:**\n- Four of a Kind: Level 2, Base Chips 90, Base Mult 10\n- Flush: Level 1, Base Chips 35, Base Mult 4 (played twice for 272 chips each)\n- I have 4 hands available\n- I have 4 discards (3 base + 1 from Drunkard)\n- Boss effect: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n\nThe boss blind has a devastating effect: \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\". This means:\n- When I play a hand, 2 cards from my deck will be randomly discarded\n- This makes it MUCH harder to construct specific hands like Four of a Kind or Flush\n- Each hand I play reduces my deck by 2 cards\n\nLet me think about the strategy:\n1. I need 600 chips total\n2. I have 4 hands available\n3. The boss will discard 2 cards from my deck each time I play a hand\n\nIf I play Flush (272 chips each):\n- 2 Flushes = 544 chips (not enough)\n- 3 Flushes = 816 chips (enough!)\n- But each flush requires 5 cards of the same suit\n- With 2 cards being discarded per hand, this becomes increasingly difficult\n\nIf I play Four of a Kind (~500-1300 chips):\n- 1 Four of a Kind could be enough if I get a good one\n- 2 Four of a Kind would definitely be enough\n\n\n- But assembling four matching ranks is even more challenging than finding five cards of the same suit, especially with the random discards eating into my deck. The boss's effect makes both strategies risky, though Four of a Kind offers a faster path if I can construct it. Since I'm locked into play_round at this stage, I need to proceed with the round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
