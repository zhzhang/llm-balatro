{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $36\n- Just rerolled the shop for $5 (now have $36, reroll cost increased to $6)\n\n**My Jokers (5/5 slots):**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played (Currently +1 Mult)\n5. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n\n**New Shop Options:**\n- Cards: \n  1. Splash (+Every played card counts in scoring) - $3\n  2. The High Priestess (Creates up to 2 random Planet cards) - $3\n- Boosters: Arcana Pack ($4)\n- Vouchers: Reroll Surplus ($10)\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nMy main strategy is Five of a Kind with 5 Aces, which leverages Scholar and Hanging Chad.\n\nLooking at the new options:\n\n1. **Splash** - This is VERY interesting! \"Every played card counts in scoring\" means that when I play 5 cards, ALL 5 cards will contribute their chip values to the score, not just the ones that participate in the hand. This could be huge for my Five of a Kind strategy since all 5 Aces would score with Scholar's +20 chips and +4 mult each, and Hanging Chad would retrigger the first Ace 2 additional times.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. With Splash, every played card counts in scoring. This means:\n- When I play 5 Aces, all 5 Aces contribute their chip values\n\n\n- Scholar gives +20 chips and +4 mult to each Ace when scored\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the first Ace 2 additional times\n- The base Five of a Kind hand (155 chips, 15 mult) still applies\n\nThis could be extremely powerful! Each Ace would contribute 31 chips (11 base + 20 from Scholar), and the first Ace scores three times total due to Hanging Chad's retrigger effect. The combination of Splash ensuring all five Aces count, Scholar boosting each one, and Hanging Chad multiplying the first Ace's contribution creates a massive scoring engine for this hand. d' Jokers (Scholar is \"when scored\")\n   - Retriggers\n4. Held-in-hand abilities\n5. Independent Jokers (Jolly Joker's pair check happens here)\n6. Consumables\n\nWith Splash, every played card counts. So all 5 Aces would score.\n\nFor each Ace:\n- Base: 11 chips\n- Scholar: +20 chips, +4 mult (when scored)\n- First Ace also gets retriggered 2 times by Hanging Chad\n\nSo:\n- Base hand: 155 chips, 15 mult\n- First Ace: (11 + 20) chips = 31 chips, +4 mult, then retriggered 2 more times = 93 chips, +12 mult total\n- Other 4 Aces: (11 + 20) ×\n\nI need to be more careful about when things trigger. The scoring sequence matters—Scholar activates when each card scores, and Hanging Chad retriggered the first Ace twice. All five Aces get Scholar's bonus since they're all played with Splash. The first Ace gets hit three times total (initial play plus two retrigs), while the remaining four each score once.\n\nThe final calculation: 372 chips × 51 multiplier gives me nearly 19,000 chips—almost triple what I scored before. High Priestess could level up hands but it's random, and Arcana Pack might provide useful tarots though I'm already exploring other options.\n\nSplash is the clear priority at $3, but I need to make room since my joker slots are full. I'd need to sell something first before I can add it, then I'd have $33 remaining to consider other purchases like another reroll or additional card enhancements.\n\nLooking at what to cut: Rocket just generates money passively, while Green Joker only adds +1 mult—both are the weakest contributors compared to Jolly Joker's pair bonus, Hanging Chad's crucial retriggering, and Scholar's Ace synergy. Green Joker is the clear choice to remove since it offers minimal scoring value.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [4]"}
