{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Shop phase after beating Big Blind\n- Money: $10\n- Owned Jokers: Luchador (sells for $2) - \"Sell this card to disable the current Boss Blind\"\n- Next blind is Boss Blind (600 chips required)\n- Boss effect: \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\"\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Loyalty Card - $5 - \"X4 Mult every 6 hands played, 5 remaining\"\n2. Buffoon Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n3. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n4. Reroll Surplus voucher - $10 - Rerolls cost $2 less\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just bought Luchador for free. Now I need to decide my strategy:\n\n1. **Sell Luchador immediately** - This will disable the Boss Blind effect (no more discarding 2 random cards per hand). This gives me $2, bringing my total to $12.\n\n2. After selling Luchador, I'd have $12 to spend on:\n   - Buffoon Pack ($4) - Get a scoring joker\n   - Celestial Pack ($4) - Level up Flush (which I've been playing successfully)\n   - Loyalty Card ($5) - Won't trigger in time for Boss Blind (only 4 hands available)\n   - Reroll Surplus ($10) - Could be useful long-term but expensive\n\n**Best Strategy:**\n\nThe Boss Blind requires 600 chips. Without Luchador's effect active, the Boss will discard 2 random cards per hand, making it very difficult to form good hands. I've been successfully playing Flushes (272 chips each), but with 2 cards being randomly discarded each hand, forming a 5-card flush becomes nearly impossible.\n\n\nSelling Luchador gives me $12 total. I'll grab the Buffoon Pack to add a scoring joker and the Celestial Pack to upgrade Flush, leaving me with $4. This disables the Boss's discard effect while strengthening my hand with better multipliers and a leveled-up Flush that should push me closer to the 600-chip threshold.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
