{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n3. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n4. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n5. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n6. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n7. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round (doesn't affect scoring)\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Situation:**\n- Need 7,500 chips to beat the Big Blind\n- 4 hands remaining\n- 2 discards remaining\n- Current chips: 0\n\nI have THREE Aces (positions 2, 5, 6) and TWO Queens (positions 1, 7).\n\n**Possible hands:**\n1. Three of a Kind with Aces (positions 2, 5, 6)\n2. Full House with 3 Aces + 2 Queens (positions 2, 5, 6, 1, 7)\n3. Two Pair (Aces and Queens)\n\nLet me calculate the Full House option since it has the highest base chips and mult:\n\n**Full House: positions 2, 5, 6, 1, 7 (3 Aces + 2 Queens)**\n\nBase hand: Full House = 40 chips, 4 mult\n\nWith Splash, all 5 cards count in scoring.\n\n\nSince Hanging Chad retriggers the first card played, I need to lead with an Ace to maximize Scholar's bonus. Playing the Ace of Hearts first means it triggers Scholar (+20 chips, +4 mult) on the initial play, then again on each of the two retriggered instances, multiplying that value significantly.\n\nAfter the Ace of Hearts generates 93 chips and 12 mult total, the remaining cards follow: two more Aces each contributing 31 chips and 4 mult from Scholar, then the two Queens adding their base values of 10 chips each with no multiplier effects.\n\nThe hand totals 215 chips across all cards with 32 multiplier, yielding 6,880 points—still below the 7,500 threshold. I'm considering whether discarding makes sense given I have three Aces remaining in the deck. If I draw a fourth Ace, Four of a Kind would provide a much stronger foundation with 90 base chips and 10 base multiplier at Level 2.\n\nWith four Aces plus one additional card, the first Ace would trigger Scholar three times for 93 chips and 12 multiplier, while each subsequent Ace triggers it once more, adding 31 chips and 4 multiplier per card. The fifth card contributes its own value, and Jolly Joker adds 8 multiplier. This setup reaches 276 chips before the fifth card, then 42 total multiplier—or 286 chips if that final card is a Queen.\n\nThat gives me 286 × 42 = 12,012 chips, which comfortably surpasses the 7,500 target. My current hand falls short, so I need to pursue the fourth Ace. With two discards remaining and three Aces left in a 37-card deck, I have roughly a 24% chance of drawing at least one. The math isn't favorable, but my hand won't reach the goal otherwise, so it's worth the attempt. I'll discard the 8 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, and 7 of Diamonds to maximize my chances.\n\nOn second thought, I should play this Full House now for 6,880 chips. That leaves me needing only about 620 more across my final three hands, which is very achievable.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,5,6,1,7]"}
