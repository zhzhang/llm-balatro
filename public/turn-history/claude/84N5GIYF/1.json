{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 0\n- At BLIND_SELECT phase\n- I have an Uncommon Tag (Shop has a free Uncommon Joker)\n- Current Blind: Big blind - needs 450 chips, rewards $4\n- Tag for skipping: Investment Tag (gives $25 after defeating the Boss Blind)\n- Current Money: $4\n- No jokers yet\n- No consumables yet\n- Boss Blind: 600 chips needed, \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\", rewards $5\n\n**Options:**\n1. Play the Big Blind (450 chips needed, $4 reward)\n2. Skip the Big Blind (get Investment Tag - $25 after beating Boss Blind)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nIf I skip the Big Blind:\n- I get the Investment Tag ($25 after beating the Boss)\n- I don't get the $4 reward from beating the blind\n- I stay at $4\n- I won't get to shop before facing the Boss Blind\n- I'll have to face the Boss Blind with no jokers and only $4\n\nIf I play the Big Blind:\n- I need to beat 450 chips with no jokers\n- I get $4 reward (total $8)\n- I can then shop with my Uncommon Tag + $8\n- I'll have access to a free Uncommon Joker plus potentially buying other items\n- I can prepare for the Boss Blind\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n1. **Can I beat 450 chips with no jokers?**\n   With a standard deck and base hand levels, I should be able to:\n   - A pair gives: 10 base chips + (2 × card chips) × 2 mult = roughly 40-50 chips per hand\n   - Two pair gives: 20 base chips + (4 × card chips) × 2 mult = roughly 80-100 chips\n   - Three of a kind gives: 30 base chips + (3 × card chips) × 3 mult = roughly 120-150 chips\n   - With 4 hands and 3 discards, I should be able to manage 450 chips\n\n2. **Investment Tag value:**\n   The Investment Tag gives $25 AFTER beating the Boss Blind. That's a lot of money, but I need to beat the Boss first.\n\n3. **Boss Blind difficulty:**\n   The Boss \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\". This is quite challenging! It means every time I play a hand, 2 random cards from my hand are discarded, making it harder to build strong hands. Without jokers or preparation, this could be nearly impossible to overcome with just $4 and no items.\n\n4. **Risk assessment:**\n   Skipping leaves me vulnerable—no jokers, minimal money, and 600 chips to beat with an active Boss effect. Playing now lets me secure a free Uncommon Joker and build up to $8, which gives me actual options for the Boss fight rather than hoping the Investment Tag payoff is worth the gamble.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should play the Big Blind to establish economy and grab jokers before the Boss becomes unmanageable.\n\nThe Boss discards 2 random cards each hand, so I'll need joker support to handle that pressure. My Uncommon Tag is too valuable to waste—I can use it to shop for a strong joker right after this blind. The $25 from Investment is tempting, but it's only useful if I can actually win, and without preparation that's unlikely. Playing now gives me money, interest, remaining hand payouts, and a shop opportunity with my free Uncommon Joker to build a real strategy.\n\nAction: play_round","action":"\"play_round\""}
