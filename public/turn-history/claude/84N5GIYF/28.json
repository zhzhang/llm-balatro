{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3 (just completed Small Blind)\n- In the SHOP phase\n- Money: $2\n- Next blinds: Big Blind and Boss Blind for Ante 2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Drunkard: +1 discard each round\n2. Ice Cream: +95 chips (decreasing by 5 each hand)\n3. Jolly Joker: +8 mult for pairs\n4. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Invisible Joker: $8 (can't afford)\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: $6 (can't afford)\n- Standard Pack: $4 (can't afford)\n- Hone Voucher: $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\nWith only $2, I cannot afford any of the items in the shop or even a reroll. The cheapest item is the Standard Pack at $4, and I'm $2 short.\n\nMy options are:\n1. Sell a joker to get more money\n2. Move on to the next blind (round_select)\n\nShould I sell a joker?\n- Drunkard sells for $2 → I'd have $4 total\n- Ice Cream sells for $2 → I'd have $4 total  \n- Jolly Joker sells for $1 → I'd have $3 total\n- Hanging Chad sells for $2 → I'd have $4 total (just bought it!)\n\nIf I sell Drunkard, Ice Cream, or Hanging Chad for $2, I'd have $4 total, which could buy:\n- Standard Pack ($4) - adds one playing card to deck\n\nIf I sell Jolly Joker for $1, I'd have $3 total, which can't buy anything.\n\n\nHanging Chad's retriggering effect is too powerful to sacrifice, and Jolly Joker's pair multiplier is core to my strategy. Ice Cream is declining in value anyway, but Drunkard's extra discard is useful. A Standard Pack might provide an enhanced card, though it's uncertain. I'm leaning toward skipping the shop entirely and preserving my current joker synergies for the upcoming blinds. The Devil could turn a card into Gold for +$3 when played, and The Lovers makes a card Wild to count as any suit—both powerful options that would work well with Hanging Chad's retriggering ability. Ice Cream is declining anyway and will eventually be worthless, so trading it along with Drunkard for the Arcana Pack seems worth it, especially since Jolly Joker's +8 mult for pairs is strong enough to keep. I'll sell Ice Cream first.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [2]"}
