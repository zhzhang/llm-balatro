{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 4 (Big Blind)\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Chips Needed: 1200\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Money: $0\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades - +11 chips\n2. 9 of Spades - +9 chips\n3. 7 of Spades - +7 chips\n4. 6 of Spades - +6 chips\n5. 2 of Hearts - +2 chips\n6. 8 of Clubs - +8 chips\n7. 5 of Clubs - +5 chips\n8. Ace of Diamonds - +11 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have a pair of Aces! This is perfect for my strategy with Jolly Joker and Hanging Chad.\n\nLet me calculate the chips for playing the pair of Aces:\n\nBase hand (Pair):\n- Base chips: 10\n- Base mult: 2\n\nCards that will score (only the Aces since they form the pair):\n1. First Ace (position 1): +11 chips, will be retriggered 2 times by Hanging Chad\n2. Second Ace (position 8): +11 chips\n\nNow let me trace through the scoring order:\n1. Boss Blind effects: None\n2. 'On played' Jokers: None\n3. Played cards score left-to-right:\n   - First Ace (Ace of Spades, position 1):\n     - Base: +11 chips\n     - Retriggers 2 times (Hanging Chad): +11 chips x 2 = +22 chips\n     - Total from first Ace: 33 chips\n   - Second Ace (Ace of Diamonds, position 8):\n     - Base: +11 chips\n     - Hanging Chad only affects the first card, so no additional retriggers\n     - Total from second Ace: 11 chips\n4. Held-in-hand abilities: None\n5. 'Independent' Jokers:\n   - Jolly Joker: +8 mult (because we played a pair)\n\nThis gives me 54 chips × 10 mult = 540 total score, which falls short of the 1200 target. I need to explore other options. I could potentially form a flush with my four Spades (Ace, 9, 7, 6), but that requires five cards. Let me reconsider the available combinations more carefully.\n\nLooking back at my previous hand that scored 1,300 chips on Ante 2, I had the same jokers active. The key difference might be in how I'm calculating the retrigger mechanic. When Hanging Chad retriggers a card, it scores that card's value multiple times—once normally, then two additional times. For the pair of Aces, the first Ace should contribute its base value plus the retrigger bonuses.\n\nLet me recalculate: if the first Ace is worth 11 chips and gets scored three times total, that's 33 chips just from that card. Adding the second Ace at 11 chips and the base pair value of 10 gives me 54 chips before multipliers. With Jolly Joker providing 8 mult on top of the base 2, I'm looking at 54 × 10 = 540 chips—still far short of 1,300.\n\nI'm wondering if I'm missing something about the scoring or if my previous hand had significantly better cards. Rather than trying to optimize this current hand further, maybe I should consider discarding some cards to hunt for a stronger combination, like a better pair or additional Spades for a flush.\n\nActually, I realize I have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining. Even if this pair only yields 540 chips, that leaves me needing roughly 760 more across my remaining hands. With that many attempts left, playing this hand now and reassessing seems reasonable. The question is whether discarding to improve my odds is worth using up one of my limited discards, or if I should just commit to this play and rely on my remaining hands to close the gap. - Base mult: 4\n- Total chips with Hanging Chad retriggering: 35 + 33 + 9 + 7 + 6 + X = (90 + X) chips\n- Multiplied by 4 gives (360 + 4X) chips\n\nEven with an Ace as the fifth Spade, I'd only reach 404 chips—well short of the 540 I can guarantee with pairs over the final hands.\n\nThe pair of Aces is the stronger play. I'll select positions 1 and 8.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,8]"}
