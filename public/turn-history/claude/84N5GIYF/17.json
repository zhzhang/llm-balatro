{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n2. King of Clubs (+10 chips)\n3. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n4. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n5. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n6. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n7. 9 of Diamonds (+9 chips)\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**Situation:**\n- Need 600 chips total\n- Current chips: 324\n- Chips needed: 600 - 324 = 276 chips remaining\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 1\n- Boss effect: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\n\n**What I have:**\nLooking at suits:\n- Hearts: Ace (1 card)\n- Clubs: King, Queen, 9, 6, 3 (5 cards!)\n- Diamonds: 9, 6 (2 cards)\n\nPerfect!

Let me select the best ones by chip value:\n- King of Clubs (+10)\n- Queen of Clubs (+10)\n- 9 of Clubs (+9)\n- 6 of Clubs (+6)\n- 3 of Clubs (+3)\n\nBase chips for Flush: 35\nCard chips: 10 + 10 + 9 + 6 + 3 = 38\nTotal chips: 35 + 38 = 73\nBase mult: 4\nTotal score: 73 × 4 = 292 chips\n\nAdding this to my current 324 chips: 324 + 292 = 616 chips\n\nThat's more than 600, so I'll WIN the round with this hand!\n\n\nI'll select the five Club cards from positions 2 through 6—the King, Queen, 9, 6, and 3—which form the Flush I need to reach my target.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,6]"}
