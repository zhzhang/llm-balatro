{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, in the SHOP phase after beating the Big Blind\n- Current Money: $10\n- No jokers, no consumables\n- Next blind is the Boss Blind which requires 600 chips and \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\"\n- I previously had an Uncommon Tag, but it seems to have been consumed (not shown in current tags)\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Luchador (Uncommon) - $0 - \"Sell this card to disable the current Boss Blind\"\n2. Loyalty Card (Uncommon) - $5 - \"X4 Mult every 6 hands played, 5 remaining\"\n3. Buffoon Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n4. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately\n5. Reroll Surplus voucher - $10 - Rerolls cost $2 less\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Luchador card is FREE and will disable the Boss Blind! This is incredibly valuable. The Boss effect of \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\" is quite challenging, so disabling it would make the Boss Blind much easier.\n\nHowever, let me think about whether I should take Luchador or build a stronger strategy:\n\n**Option 1: Take Luchador (Free)**\n- Pros: Disables the Boss Blind effect, making it much easier. Costs $0\n- Cons: Takes up a joker slot, and I'd still need to score 600 chips with no actual scoring jokers\n\n**Option 2: Buy Loyalty Card ($5)**\n- \"X4 Mult every 6 hands played, 5 remaining\"\n- This means after playing 5 more hands, the next hand gets X4 mult\n\n\n- In the Boss Blind with only 4 hands available, I won't trigger this effect in time, so it's not useful here\n\n**Option 3: Buy Buffoon Pack ($4)**\n- Get to choose from 2 jokers\n- Could get a better scoring joker\n- Cost: $4, leaving me with $6\n\n**Option 4: Buy Celestial Pack ($4)**\n- Level up a hand type\n- I've been playing Flush (twice), so I could level that up\n- Current Flush: 35 chips + 4 mult\n- Cost: $4\n\n, leaving me with $6\n\nThe Boss Blind needs 600 chips with 4 hands and 3 discards available. If I take Luchador to disable the Boss's card discard effect, I'd need about 150 chips per hand on average—two Flushes would give me 544 chips, requiring one more solid hand to reach the threshold. Without Luchador, the Boss discarding 2 random cards per hand makes forming good hands nearly impossible, so I'd be heavily dependent on jokers to compensate. Taking Luchador for free seems like the strongest play since it removes the main obstacle.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider how Luchador works. It says I need to sell the card to disable the Boss, not just own it. If I sell it immediately, I don't use a joker slot and the Boss gets disabled. So I'd buy Luchador for $0, sell it right away to disable the Boss, then buy the Buffoon Pack for $4, leaving me with $6 and a joker from the pack. The question is whether selling Luchador gives me money back—typically selling cards does provide funds, which would affect my total available for other purchases.\n\nLooking at the available commands, I can buy cards by position. Luchador is position 1 in the shop. I'm weighing two main approaches: one where I disable the Boss using Luchador and then invest in a scoring joker through the Buffoon Pack, versus another where I skip the Boss disable and instead build stronger jokers by purchasing multiple booster packs with my full budget.\n\nThe first approach seems stronger—using Luchador to neutralize the Boss effect costs nothing and opens up my $10 to spend on boosters. After selling Luchador for roughly $1-2, I'd have around $11-12 to work with, enough for both a Buffoon Pack and potentially a Celestial Pack to level up a hand. The Loyalty Card option doesn't work well here since the Boss Blind only gives 4 hands, so it won't trigger.\n\nLet me go with buying Luchador first.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
