{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3 (just finished Small Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $0\n- Just used Strength tarot to upgrade King to Ace and 9 to 10\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 mult for pairs\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Invisible Joker: $8 (can't afford, have $0)\n- Standard Pack: $4 (can't afford)\n- Hone Voucher: $10 (can't afford)\n- Reroll: $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\nI have $0 and cannot afford anything in the shop. I have no consumables to sell, and my jokers are both valuable to my strategy:\n- Jolly Joker gives +8 mult for pairs, which is my main strategy\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the first card, which is very powerful\n\nSince I cannot afford to buy anything and don't want to sell my core jokers, the only logical action is to proceed to the next round. I should use `round_select` to finish shopping and move on to the blind select phase.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I could sell one of my jokers to get some money, but:\n- Selling Jolly Joker ($1) would only give me $1, not enough to buy anything\n- Selling Hanging Chad ($2) would give me $2, still not enough to buy the Standard Pack ($4)\n- Selling both would give me $3, still not enough\n\nSo selling jokers wouldn't help me buy anything meaningful. I should keep my jokers and move on to the next round.\n\nThe best action is: `round_select`","action":"\"round_select\""}
