{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Money: $0\n- Jokers: Drunkard (+1 discard), Ice Cream (+100 chips, -5 per hand), Jolly Joker (+8 mult if hand contains a pair)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (2 slots available)\n- Max Consumables: 2 (2 slots available)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Ancient Joker - Each played card with Diamond suit gives X1.5 Mult when scored - $8 (can't afford)\n2. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 3 Playing cards - $4 (can't afford)\n3. Hone Voucher - Foil/Holographic/Polychrome appear 2x more often - $10 (can't afford)\n4. Reroll - $5 (can't afford)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $0, so I cannot afford anything in the shop. My only option is to proceed to the next phase by using the `round_select` command.\n\nLet me think about my current joker setup:\n- Drunkard: +1 discard per round - useful for card selection\n- Ice Cream: +100 chips, -5 chips per hand - very strong early boost\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult if hand contains a pair - synergizes well with flush strategy\n\nMy strategy has been playing flushes (played 4 so far, averaging ~290 chips). With the new jokers:\n- Ice Cream gives +100 chips on first hand, +95 on second, etc.\n- Jolly Joker adds +8 mult when I have a pair in my flush\n\nExpected scoring for a flush with a pair:\n- Base chips: 35\n- Card chips: ~40 (varies)\n\n\n- Ice Cream: +100 (first hand)\n- Total chips: ~175\n- Base mult: 4\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult\n- Total mult: 12\n- Total score: 175 × 12 = 2,100 chips\n\nThis combination should easily exceed Ante 2's Small Blind requirement. With no funds available, I'll move forward to round select.","action":"\"round_select\""}
