{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Just beat the Big Blind (Round 8) of Ante 4\n- Now in the shop phase\n- Current Money: $37\n- At Ante 4/8, need to progress through 4 more Antes to win\n\n**Current Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\nCards:\n1. Half Joker - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards ($5)\n2. Ride the Bus - Gains +1 Mult per consecutive hand without face cards ($6)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards ($4)\n2. Jumbo Standard Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Playing cards ($6)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less ($10)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy current joker setup has been working well:\n- Splash is extremely powerful, allowing all played cards to score\n- Hanging Chad provides strong retrigger on the first card\n- Scholar synergizes well with Aces\n- Jolly Joker provides consistent Mult for pairs\n- Rocket provides economic value\n\nLooking at the shop options:\n\n1. **Half Joker** ($5) - +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards. This conflicts with Splash, which encourages playing 5 cards. Not a good fit for my current strategy.\n\n\n2. **Ride the Bus** ($6) - Gains +1 Mult per consecutive hand without face cards. This could be good, but requires careful hand management and conflicts with playing face cards/Aces which are strong with Scholar.\n3. **Buffoon Pack** ($4) - Could potentially get a better joker than what's currently in the shop. This is always a gamble but could yield something more synergistic.\n4. **Jumbo Standard Pack** ($6) - Adding playing cards to deck. Not immediately necessary unless I need specific cards for synergies.\n5. **Reroll Surplus** ($10) - Reduces reroll cost from $5 to $3, making future shop adjustments cheaper.\n\nRide the Bus creates tension with my Ace-heavy strategy since Scholar rewards face cards. The Buffoon Pack offers upside potential for a better Joker at a low cost, while Reroll Surplus provides flexibility for future rounds.\n\nLooking at my scoring trajectory—High Card at 1,716 chips, Full House at 4,152, and Five of a Kind at 6,501—I'm seeing solid growth but need to ensure I can scale further as Ante requirements climb. With $37 available and facing Ante 4/8, I should prioritize either immediate Joker upgrades or tools that let me adapt my shop options more freely.\n\nThe Buffoon Pack at $4 is appealing since it gives me a choice between up to 2 Joker cards, which is relatively efficient for potentially replacing weaker cards like my Jolly Joker. Since I'm already at max Joker capacity, landing something stronger would let me swap out lower-value pieces. I'll go with the Buffoon Pack purchase.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
