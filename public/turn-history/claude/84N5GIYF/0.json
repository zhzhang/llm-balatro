{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 0 (just starting)\n- At BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Current Blind: Small blind - needs 300 chips, rewards $3\n- Tag for skipping: Uncommon Tag (gives free Uncommon Joker in shop)\n- Current Money: $4\n- No jokers yet\n- No consumables yet\n\n**Options:**\n1. Play the Small Blind (300 chips needed, $3 reward)\n2. Skip the Small Blind (get Uncommon Tag - free Uncommon Joker in shop)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nIf I skip:\n- I get an Uncommon Tag which gives me a free Uncommon Joker in the shop\n- I don't get the $3 reward from beating the blind\n- I stay at $4\n- I move directly to the next blind decision (Big Blind)\n\nIf I play:\n- I need to beat 300 chips\n- I get $3 reward (total $7)\n- I can then shop with $7\n- I progress normally through the ante\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nAt the very start of the game with no jokers, 300 chips for the Small Blind is quite achievable with a standard deck. I should be able to play basic hands like pairs or two pairs to reach 300 chips.\n\nHowever, the Uncommon Tag is quite valuable - it gives me a free Uncommon Joker. Uncommon jokers are typically worth $5-6, so this is a significant value gain.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Playing gives me $3 + whatever I earn from the round\n- Skipping gives me a free Uncommon Joker (worth ~$5-6)\n\nBut there's more to consider:\n- If I skip, I don't get to shop after the Small Blind\n- If I play and win, I get to shop with $7 (my current $4 + $3 reward)\n\n\n- The free Uncommon Joker from skipping is very strong early game value\n\nLooking ahead at the upcoming blinds, the Big Blind offers an Investment Tag worth $25 after the boss, which is also quite strong. But skipping too many blinds early without building economy and jokers is risky. I need to balance taking valuable tags with actually progressing through the ante.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think the best play here is to **skip the Small Blind** and take the Uncommon Tag.\n\nThe free Uncommon Joker is worth roughly $5-6, significantly better than the $3 I'd earn from playing. With $4 already in hand plus this joker, I'll have a solid starting position to tackle the Big Blind. I can then use that Uncommon Joker to help me play through the Big Blind, and reassess whether to skip that one for the Investment Tag based on how things develop.\n\nSo my action should be: **skip_round**","action":"\"skip_round\""}
