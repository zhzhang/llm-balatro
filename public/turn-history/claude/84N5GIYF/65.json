{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- I'm in the SHOP phase after beating the Small Blind\n- Current Money: $49\n- I just sold Photograph joker for $2, bringing me from $47 to $49\n\n**My Jokers (4/5 slots):**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair (sells for $1)\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times (sells for $2)\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated (sells for $3)\n4. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +1 Mult) (sells for $2)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\nCards:\n1. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored ($4) - This is EXTREMELY strong for my Ace-based strategy!\n2. Crafty Joker - +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush ($4)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards to be used immediately ($4)\n2. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately ($4)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less ($10)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI just played Five of a Kind with 5 Aces and scored 6,501 chips. Scholar would be PERFECT for this strategy because:\n- Each Ace would give +20 chips and +4 mult when scored\n- With Hanging Chad retriggering the first Ace 2 additional times (3 total), that's massive value\n\n\n- Since I consistently draw all 5 Aces, the first one triggers 3 times for 93 chips and 12 mult, while the remaining 4 contribute 124 chips and 16 mult—totaling 217 chips and 28 mult per full hand. This synergy is too valuable to pass up.\n\nWith $49 to spend, I'll grab Scholar for $4, leaving me $45. From there, I could pick up Celestial Pack to boost Five of a Kind, or Arcana Pack for additional flexibility. My main focus should be securing Scholar immediately, then reassessing what makes sense with the remaining budget.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
