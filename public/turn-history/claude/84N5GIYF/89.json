{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 8 (Boss Blind)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Boss Description: Start with 0 discards\n- Current Money: $34\n- Reward for beating boss: $5\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n2. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, +$2 when Boss defeated\n3. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult\n4. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mime - Retrigger all card held in hand abilities\n\n**Key Constraint:** The Boss Blind starts with 0 discards, meaning I can't discard cards to improve my hand. I'll need to play whatever hands I'm dealt.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my last played hands, I've been scoring well:\n- Five of a Kind: 6,501 chips\n- Full House: 4,152 chips\n- High Card: 1,716 chips\n- Pairs: 590-1,092 chips\n\nI need 10,000 chips total. Given that I have no discards, I need to be strategic about which hands I play.\n\nMy joker synergies:\n- Splash makes every card count in scoring\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card 2 additional times\n- Scholar boosts Aces (+20 chips, +4 mult when scored)\n- Mime retriggers held-in-hand abilities (less useful since I'm playing all cards with Splash)\n\nWith 0 discards, I'll need to make the best of whatever I'm dealt. My best scoring hands have been:\n- Five of a Kind (Level 2): 155 chips, 15 mult base\n- Four of a Kind (Level 2): 90 chips, 10 mult base\n\n\n- Full House (Level 2): 40 chips, 4 mult base\n- Flush (Level 2): 35 chips, 4 mult base\n\nThe no-discard restriction is tough, but Splash ensures every card contributes to my score regardless of hand type. I'm ready to start the round and see what cards I'm dealt.\n\nJoker order actually matters here since effects chain left-to-right. Hanging Chad triggers on played cards first, then Scholar activates when Aces score, while Mime retriggers held-in-hand abilities later in the sequence. Since I'm playing all cards with Splash, I want Hanging Chad early to maximize retriggers before the scoring phase. The current arrangement seems solid, so I'll proceed without rearranging.\n\nI'm confident in this hand—the joker synergies are strong enough that I should hit 10,000 chips without needing discards.","action":"\"play_round\""}
