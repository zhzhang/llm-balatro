{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- Money: $6\n- I'm in the SHOP phase\n- Jokers: Drunkard (+1 discard), Ice Cream (+100 chips, -5 per hand)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n1. Ancient Joker - X1.5 Mult for Diamond cards, suit changes each round - $8 (can't afford)\n2. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n3. Jumbo Buffoon Pack - Choose 1 of 4 Joker cards - $6\n4. Hone Voucher - Foil/Holographic/Polychrome appear 2x more often - $10 (can't afford)\n5. Reroll - $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI have $6 to spend. My options are:\n- Standard Pack ($4) - leaves me with $2\n- Jumbo Buffoon Pack ($6) - leaves me with $0\n- Reroll ($5) - leaves me with $1\n- Round select - keep my $6\n\nI've been playing Flush hands successfully. Looking at my hand levels, Flush is Level 1 with base chips 35 and base mult 4. I've played 4 flushes so far.\n\nWith Ice Cream, my flushes will now score around:\n- Base chips: 35\n- Card chips: ~40 (varies by cards)\n- Ice Cream bonus: +100 chips (first hand), then -5 per hand\n- Total chips before mult: ~175 chips (first hand)\n- Mult: 4\n- Total score: ~700 chips (first hand)\n\nThis is very strong! The Ice Cream joker significantly boosts my scoring.\n\nLooking at Ante 2 requirements:\n- Small Blind: ~300 chips\n\n\n- Big Blind: ~450 chips  \n- Boss Blind: ~600 chips\n\nWith Ice Cream, I should be able to easily clear these thresholds. The Jumbo Buffoon Pack is tempting since another strong joker could multiply my scoring potential, but I'm already in a solid position. A Standard Pack would let me fine-tune my deck with a specific card, though one card's impact is minimal at this stage.\n\nRerolling for $5 leaves me with almost nothing, and while I might find better options, the risk isn't worth it when I'm already comfortable. Saving my $6 for the next shop gives me more flexibility and lets me see what other opportunities come up. I'll move forward without spending.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
