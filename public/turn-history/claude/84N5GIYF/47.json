{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $12 (I got the Handy Tag which gave me $10)\n- Boss Blind: Need 4000 chips, All Club cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5 + Investment Tag's $25 = $30 after beating this boss\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated (so will give $3 after this boss)\n\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at my past scoring:\n- Pairs have scored between 380-1,300 chips\n- My best pair was 1,200 chips\n- Average around 500-600 chips per pair\n\nTo reach 4000 chips:\n- If I average 500 chips/hand, I need 8 hands\n- If I average 600 chips/hand, I need ~7 hands\n- If I can get some 1000+ chip hands, I might need 4-5 hands\n\nThe boss debuffs all Club cards. This means:\n- Any club cards in my hand won't contribute chips\n- Club cards won't trigger their abilities\n- But they can still form pairs/hand types with other cards\n\nMy strategy should be to:\n1. Play pairs with non-club cards when possible\n2. Use Hanging Chad to retrigger the first card (ideally a face card for Photograph's X2 mult)\n3. Jolly Joker gives +8 mult for pairs\n\nLet me calculate a typical scoring hand:\n\n\n- Base pair: 10 chips + 2 mult\n- Two cards in pair (non-club): 2 * 10 = 20 chips (assuming 10-value cards)\n- Total chips before mult: 30 chips\n- Base mult: 2\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult = 10 mult\n- If first card is a face card: Photograph X2 mult = 20 mult\n- Hanging Chad retriggers first card 2 times, so I get the chips and effects from that card 3 times total. If it's a face card with 10 chips: 10 * 3 = 30 chips from retriggering alone, which then gets multiplied by the 20x mult from Photograph and Jolly Joker combined.\n\nThe final calculation works out to around 1200 chips, matching my best previous attempt. With 4-5 solid hands remaining, reaching 4000 chips seems achievable. Since I'm stuck at the Boss Blind and can't skip it, I need to play this round.","action":"\"play_round\""}
