{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 4\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $1\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Credit Card (Holographic) - Go up to -$20 in debt, +10 Mult from card + 10 Mult from holo = +20 Mult total - Cost: $4\n2. Crazy Joker - +12 Mult if played hand contains a Straight - Cost: $4\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards to be used immediately - Cost: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Hone - Foil, Holographic, and Polychrome cards appear 2X more often - Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $1, which is not enough to buy anything in the shop. My options are:\n1. Sell a joker to get more money\n2. End shopping and go to the next round\n\nLet me think about whether I should sell a joker:\n- Jolly Joker: +8 Mult for pairs - sells for $1\n- Hanging Chad: Retriggers first played card 2 times - sells for $2\n- Photograph: X2 Mult for first face card - sells for $2\n\nIf I sell Hanging Chad ($2) or Photograph ($2), I'd have $3 total, which is still not enough to buy anything ($4 minimum).\n\nIf I sell both Hanging Chad and Photograph, I'd have $5, which could:\n\n\n- Reroll the shop (but then I'd have no money to buy anything)\n- Not buy anything either\n\nSelling all three jokers gives me $5 total, still short of the $4 items. Let me recalculate the combinations: selling Hanging Chad and Photograph together would give me $1 + $2 + $2 = $5, which is enough to buy a $4 item with $1 left over, or reroll and have $0 remaining.\n\nThe Credit Card stands out—it offers +20 Mult and allows debt up to -$20, which could open up more purchasing options. Crazy Joker adds +12 Mult for straights but doesn't align with my current approach, while Arcana Pack might provide useful tarot cards. If I sell Hanging Chad and Photograph for $4 total, I'd have $5 to spend on the Credit Card, leaving me with $1. The real question is whether sacrificing my current jokers—particularly Jolly Joker's +8 Mult for pairs—is worth the trade-off.\n\nMy existing synergy is actually quite powerful. Hanging Chad retriggers my first card twice, and Photograph doubles Mult for the first face card. When I play a pair of face cards with a face card leading, the first card gets retriggered and doubled, generating around 50 chips that multiply by 20 total (base 2 Mult plus Jolly Joker's +8 and Photograph's X2), reaching 1000 chips. Breaking up this combination would significantly weaken my scoring potential.\n\nI should just move forward to the next round instead. I'll have more money to spend after completing this round, so I can shop then if needed.","action":"\"round_select\""}
