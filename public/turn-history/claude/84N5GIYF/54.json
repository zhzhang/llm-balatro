{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $47\n- I have 4 jokers (can have max 5)\n- No consumables (can have max 2)\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\nCards:\n1. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult) - $4\n2. Wrathful Joker - Played cards with Spade suit give +3 Mult when scored - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards to be used immediately - $6\n2. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately - $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis of Recent Performance:**\nLooking at my last played hands, I've been mostly playing Pairs and Two Pairs successfully. My jokers are working well together:\n- Hanging Chad retriggering the first card 2 additional times\n- Photograph giving X2 Mult on first face card\n- Jolly Joker giving +8 Mult on pairs\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Pair: Level 1 (played 6 times)\n\n\n- Two Pair: Level 1 (played 3 times)\n- Three of a Kind: Level 1 (played 1 time)\n- Flush: Level 1 (played 4 times)\n- Four of a Kind: Level 2\n\n**Considerations:**\n\nGreen Joker starts at +0 and scales based on hands played minus discards, which doesn't align well with my current strategy since I discard frequently. Wrathful Joker offers +3 Mult for Spades, which could complement my existing setup if I build around that suit.\n\nJumbo Arcana Pack would let me upgrade cards and jokers through Tarot effects. Celestial Pack directly levels up hand types I'm already using—particularly Pairs and Two Pairs—making it a straightforward way to boost scoring. Reroll Surplus costs $10 but cuts reroll expenses from $5 to $3, which could pay for itself if I plan multiple rerolls with my $47 bankroll.\n\nI'm at Ante 4/8, so difficulty is ramping up.  I should prioritize strengthening what's already working. The Celestial Pack at $4 is the most efficient choice since I've played Pair six times already—leveling it up will immediately improve my base scores. I'll grab that first, then reassess whether the Wrathful Joker or other upgrades make sense for future rounds.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
