{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $25\n- Just rerolled the shop (cost went up from $6 to $7)\n\n**My Jokers (5/5 slots - FULL):**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards: \n  1. Diet Cola - Sell to create free Double Tag ($6)\n  2. Mr. Bones - Prevents Death if chips scored are at least 25% of required ($5)\n- Boosters: None\n- Vouchers: Reroll Surplus ($10)\n- Reroll Cost: $7\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nMy goal is building toward Five of a Kind with 5 Aces. I currently have 2 Aces after using Strength on a King.\n\nLet me consider the new shop options:\n\n1. **Diet Cola ($6)** - Sell to create free Double Tag\n   - Costs $6 to buy, then sell for a Double Tag\n   - Double Tag would copy the next tag I receive\n   - This is a future investment - I'd need to skip a blind or win a blind to get a tag\n   - Not immediately useful for my current strategy\n\n2. **Mr. Bones ($5)** - Death prevention\n   - Safety net if I fail a blind\n   - Costs $5, would leave me with $20\n   - My joker slots are full, so I can't buy it without selling a joker\n   - Not critical right now since I've been scoring well\n   \nReroll Surplus would reduce future reroll costs to $5 instead of $7, but at $10 it's expensive and only pays off if I plan multiple rerolls. Another reroll itself costs $7 and leaves me with $18 to work with. I'm approaching the Big Blind next at Round 7, so I should focus on whether I need to see more shop options or move forward with my current Ace-building strategy.\n\nMy last Five of a Kind scored 6,501 chips, which should clear the Big Blind. The current shop doesn't offer cards that directly strengthen my Ace strategy—Diet Cola requires a longer investment cycle, and Mr. Bones would force me to sell a joker I need. Moving to the blind select makes sense since I have Scholar boosting my Aces by +20 chips and +4 mult each, Hanging Chad retriggering, Splash counting all cards, and Jolly Joker providing +8 mult on pairs. Even without hitting another Five of a Kind, pairs or trips of Aces should score well enough.","action":"\"round_select\""}
