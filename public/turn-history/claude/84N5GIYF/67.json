{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In PLANET_PACK phase (choosing from a Celestial Pack)\n- Current Money: $41\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 5)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +1 Mult)\n5. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n\n**Planet Pack Choices:**\n1. Pluto - Level up High Card +1 Mult and +10 chips\n2. Mercury - Level up Pair +1 Mult and +15 chips\n3. Planet X - Level up Five of a Kind +3 Mult and +35 chips\n\n**Current Hand Levels:**\n- Five of a Kind: Level 1, Base Chips 120, Base Mult 12, Times Played 1\n- Pair: Level 1, Base Chips 10, Base Mult 2, Times Played 6\n- High Card: Level 1, Base Chips 5, Base Mult 1, Times Played 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my last played hands:\n- Five of a Kind - 6,501 chips (most recent)\n- I've been playing various hands but Five of a Kind is clearly my strongest play\n\nPlanet X would level up Five of a Kind from Level 1 (120 chips, 12 mult) to Level 2 (155 chips, 15 mult).\n\nThe choice is clear: **Planet X** is the best option because:\n\n\nFive of a Kind is my primary winning strategy with all Aces available in my deck, and the Scholar-Hanging Chad combo amplifies this significantly. The +35 chips and +3 mult boost is substantial compared to Mercury's weaker Pair synergy or Pluto's negligible High Card value.\n\nI'm selecting Planet X to upgrade Five of a Kind.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
