{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $25\n- I have 2 Aces in my deck after using Strength to upgrade a King\n\n**My Jokers (5/5 slots - FULL):**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Current Blind Decision:**\n- Big Blind: 7,500 chips needed, Reward: $4\n- Skip Tag: Meteor Tag - Gives a free Mega Celestial Pack\n- Upcoming Boss Blind: 10,000 chips needed, \"Start with 0 discards\", Reward: $5\n\n**Last Hand Performance:**\n- Five of a Kind scored 6,501 chips on the Small Blind\n- This was with likely 5 Aces (given I just got 2 Aces total now, it must have been something else or maybe I'm misreading - let me check)\n\nWait, looking at the history, I scored 6,501 chips with Five of a Kind on Ante 4 Small Blind. But I only have 2 Aces now. That's strange. Let me think...\n\nActually, the Strength tarot was used to convert a King to an Ace, giving me 2 Aces total. The Five of a Kind that scored 6,501 chips must have been from before or something else.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n1. **Big Blind (7,500 chips):**\n   - I scored 6,501 chips with Five of a Kind before\n   - My Aces work well with Scholar and Hanging Chad for chip multiplication, plus Splash ensures all cards contribute to the score. With just 2 Aces, I can form pairs that trigger Jolly Joker's bonus, and the retrigger effect from Hanging Chad amplifies the Scholar bonus significantly.\n\n2. **Meteor Tag** offers a free Mega Celestial Pack to level up hand types like Five of a Kind, though I'd forfeit the $4 reward and skip practice.\n\n3. **Boss Blind** requires facing 10,000 chips with no discards available, which is a significant constraint.\n\nThe real question is whether I'm ready. Skipping the Big Blind means missing a chance to test my deck and confirm I can actually hit those numbers. The $4 also matters for maintaining resources. Playing through gives me concrete data on whether my scoring works before facing the Boss with zero room for error.","action":"\"play_round\""}
