{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $35\n- Just bought Splash for $3\n\n**My Jokers (5/5 slots - FULL):**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards: The High Priestess (Creates up to 2 random Planet cards) - $3\n- Boosters: Arcana Pack ($4)\n- Vouchers: Reroll Surplus ($10)\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nI now have Splash, which will make my Five of a Kind strategy extremely powerful. My joker setup is solid:\n- Scholar: Essential for Ace scoring\n- Hanging Chad: Crucial for retriggering first card\n- Splash: Makes all played cards count\n- Jolly Joker: Adds +8 mult for pairs (Five of a Kind contains a pair)\n- Rocket: Generates money at end of round\n\nNow I need to consider:\n1. The High Priestess ($3) - Creates up to 2 random Planet cards\n   - Could level up Five of a Kind or other useful hands\n   - But it's random, so I might not get Five of a Kind planets\n   - I have 2 consumable slots available\n\n2. Arcana Pack ($4) - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards\n   - Could enhance my Aces (make them Gold, Glass, etc.)\n   - Could provide other useful effects\n   - More controlled than High Priestess\n\n3. Reroll Surplus ($10) - Reduces reroll cost by $2\n   - Would leave me with $25\n   - Future rerolls would cost $4 instead of $6\n   - Long-term value but expensive now\n\n4. Reroll ($6) - See new options\n   - Would leave me with $29\n\n5. Round Select - Move on to next blind\n\nI'm halfway through Ante 4/8, and blinds will escalate. With Splash amplifying my scoring, I should focus on whether enhancing my Aces through the Arcana Pack makes sense, or if the randomness of High Priestess is worth the low cost for potential Five of a Kind scaling.\n\nThe Arcana Pack at $4 stands out—I'd get to pick from three tarot cards that could directly upgrade my Aces with effects like Gold (generating $3 per score) or other strategic modifiers. That's more reliable than hoping High Priestess triggers the right upgrade, and it leaves me with $31 for future flexibility. The World converts all cards in hand to random suits. Judgment creates a random Joker, The Fool makes the last played poker hand into a Planet card, and the suit converters (Star, Sun, Moon) can shift up to 3 cards to Diamonds, Hearts, or Clubs respectively. The Tower adds Stone enhancement for flat chips without rank or suit considerations.\n\nFor my strategy, The Strength could turn other cards into Aces, The Devil could make Aces Gold for money, Justice could give Aces Glass for doubled mult (though they'd be destroyed when scored), and The Emperor generates additional Tarot cards. The Arcana Pack at $4 seems worth it—the variety of effects could really strengthen my approach.\n\nAfter purchasing it, I'd have $31 remaining. I'm at Round 7 of Ante 4, heading into the Big Blind and then the Boss Blind, so I need to weigh whether I should grab High Priestess for $3, reroll for $6, or preserve funds for the next shop. Since my scoring just got a major boost from Splash, I'm reasonably positioned for the upcoming blinds. The Arcana Pack offers flexibility, but I should also keep some money available for unexpected needs later. I'll buy it and evaluate what I get from the pack.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
