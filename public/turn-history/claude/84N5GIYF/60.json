{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $33\n- I have 5/5 jokers (FULL)\n- 0/2 consumables\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n5. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult)\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. **Small Blind** - 5000 chips needed, $3 reward\n   - Skip tag: Rare Tag (Shop has a free Rare Joker)\n   \n2. **Big Blind** - 7500 chips needed, $4 reward\n   - Skip tag: Meteor Tag (Gives a free Mega Celestial Pack)\n   \n3. **Boss Blind** - 10000 chips needed, $5 reward\n   - Boss Effect: Start with 0 discards\n\n**Recent Enhancements:**\n- Jack of Diamonds is now a Mult Card (+4 mult)\n- Ace of Diamonds is now a Mult Card (+4 mult)\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n\nMy scoring potential is quite strong:\n- Two Pair (Level 2): Base 40 chips + 3 mult\n- Pair (Level 1): Base 10 chips + 2 mult\n- With Jolly Joker: +8 mult on pairs\n- With Hanging Chad: First card retriggers 2 additional times\n\n\n- Photograph doubles the multiplier on my first face card, and the enhanced Jack and Ace each contribute +4 mult. Playing a pair with the Jack of Diamonds could generate substantial multiplier: the base pair gives 2 mult, Jolly Joker adds 8, the Jack adds 4, and Photograph doubles it all, reaching 28 mult before Hanging Chad's retriggering amplifies the scoring further. ial for my current setup, and the extra cash helps me build toward better shop options. The Rare Tag would require selling a joker I'm using effectively, which isn't worth the trade-off right now.\n\nI'm evaluating whether my deck can consistently hit the remaining blind thresholds. With the scoring mechanics I've mapped out, the Small Blind at 5000 chips should be straightforward. I'll take the money and momentum rather than gamble on needing to restructure my joker setup for a single rare card.","action":"\"play_round\""}
