{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Boss Blind: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\"\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Current Chips: 1200 (I just scored 1200 chips on the previous hand!)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $1\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Unknown (face down)\n2. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n3. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n4. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\n6. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n8. 3 of Diamonds (+3 chips)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI need 1600 chips total, and I already have 1200 chips. So I only need 400 more chips to win this boss round!\n\nLooking at my visible hand:\n- I have a pair of 8s (positions 2 and 7)\n- I have a pair of 4s (positions 3 and 5)\n- Position 1 is face down (unknown)\n\nThe pair of 8s would give me:\n- Base chips: 10 (pair) + 8 (first 8) + 8 (second 8) = 26 chips\n- Hanging Chad retriggers first 8 twice: +8 chips x 2 = +16 chips\n\n\n- Total chips: 42 chips\n- Base mult: 2 (pair)\n- Jolly Joker: +8 Mult = 10 mult\n- Photograph doesn't trigger since 8s aren't face cards\n- Final score: 42 chips × 10 mult = 420 chips\n\nThis gets me to 1620 chips, surpassing the 1600 requirement. Playing the pair of 8s with the first 8 of Spades triggering Hanging Chad twice gives me the winning score.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [2,7]"}
