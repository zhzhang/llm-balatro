{"reasoning":"Looking at the current state:\n- I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK phase\n- I just sold Jolly Joker (position 1)\n- I now have 4 jokers (under max capacity of 5)\n- Money: $34\n- I need to choose between:\n  1. Mime - Retrigger all card held in hand abilities\n  2. Driver's License - X3 Mult if I have at least 16 Enhanced cards (currently have 2)\n\nMy current jokers:\n1. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n2. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n3. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n4. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\nBased on my previous reasoning, I should select Mime because:\n- Driver's License requires 16 enhanced cards when I only have 2, which is unrealistic to achieve at Ante 4/8\n- Mime has potential upside if I get cards with held-in-hand abilities (like Steel cards)\n- I've already spent $4 on this pack, so I should take something\n\nSince I now have room (4/5 jokers), I should be able to select from the pack.\n\nThe command would be: select 1\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Should I actually take either of these jokers? Let me think...\n\nMime: Retrigger all card held in hand abilities\n- Currently I don't have many cards with held-in-hand abilities\n- Steel cards trigger when held in hand (+50 chips)\n- Baron (if I had it) gives x1.5 mult for each King held in hand\n- With Splash, I typically play all 5 cards, leaving only 3 in hand\n- This could be useful if I get Steel cards later, but right now it doesn't do much\n\nDriver's License: X3 Mult if I have at least 16 Enhanced cards\n\n\n- I only have 2 enhanced cards currently, so I'd need 14 more\n- That's a steep requirement for the remaining antes and would consume significant resources\n\nSince I've already committed $4 to this pack, skipping it wastes that investment. Between the two options, Mime offers more realistic upside—I could naturally acquire Steel cards or other held-in-hand effects as the run progresses, whereas reaching 16 enhanced cards seems impractical.\n\nDriver's License doesn't fit my current deck at all. Mime is the better choice here.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
