{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Need 7,500 chips total to beat the Big Blind\n- Current chips: 5,244\n- Chips still needed: 7,500 - 5,244 = 2,256 chips\n- Remaining hands: 2\n- Remaining discards: 1\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n2. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n3. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n4. 2 of Hearts (+2 chips)\n5. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n6. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n7. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round (doesn't affect scoring)\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored (not active - no Aces in hand)\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Flush (4 Hearts): positions 1, 2, 3, 4\n- Pair of 7s: positions 2, 5\n- Pair of 2s: positions 4, 8\n\nLet me calculate the best scoring options:\n\n**Option 1: Flush (4 Hearts) - positions 1, 2, 3, 4**\nBase: 35 chips, 4 mult (Level 1)\nWith Splash, I can play 5 cards total.\n\nLet me play positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 (adding the 10 of Diamonds for extra chips).\n\n\nSince Hanging Chad retriggers the first card played, I should lead with the 10 of Diamonds to maximize that effect. Playing it first gives me 10 chips × 3 (original plus 2 retriggered plays) = 30 chips, then adding the 8, 7, 5, and 2 of Hearts for 22 additional chips. This totals 87 chips with a 4x multiplier.\n\nBut 348 seems too low for this hand. Let me explore a pair of 7s instead—that gives me a Level 1 base of 10 chips and 2 mult, allowing me to play 5 cards with Splash. I'd arrange positions 2 and 5 for the pair, then add the 10 of Diamonds, 8 of Hearts, and 7 of Clubs as my remaining cards. Leading with the 10 of Diamonds again for the retrigger bonus, followed by the two 7s and the 8 of Hearts\n\n, I'd score 10 + 30 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 5 = 67 chips before multipliers. With the Jolly Joker adding 8 mult to my base 2, that's 67 × 10 = 670 chips total. Still short of what I need with only two hands left. I should consider whether drawing an Ace could help—there are 3 remaining in the deck, and the Scholar joker would give a significant boost if I land one. Let me also recalculate the Flush option more carefully to see if that's actually stronger than I initially thought.\n\nIf I play a flush with 4 hearts and use Splash to add a 5th card, I can score all 5 cards. Leading with the 10 of Diamonds for Hanging Chad gives me 30 chips from that card alone, then 8, 7, 5, and 2 from the hearts, totaling 87 chips before multipliers.\n\nWith a 4x multiplier from the flush, that's only 348 chips—not enough. I should discard and hunt for Aces instead. Since there are 3 Aces in the remaining deck, discarding 5 cards gives me decent odds of hitting at least one. I'll drop the weakest cards and keep the 7 of Clubs for potential pairing, discarding the 7 of Hearts along with the 2 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds, and 5 of Hearts.\n\nActually, I need to think about this differently. I need roughly 1,128 chips per hand to reach 2,256 total, but my current best is only around 670 chips. The discard is my chance to improve significantly. Aces would unlock Scholar and give me much better scoring. Let me discard the five weakest cards—the two 2s, the 5, the 6, and the 7 of Hearts—leaving me with a shot at drawing from cards like the remaining Aces, Queens, Jacks, and 10s.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,6,8]"}
