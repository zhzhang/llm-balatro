{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $38\n- Just sold Green Joker for $2, now have 4/5 joker slots\n\n**My Jokers (4/5 slots):**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards: \n  1. Splash (Every played card counts in scoring) - $3\n  2. The High Priestess (Creates up to 2 random Planet cards) - $3\n- Boosters: Arcana Pack ($4)\n- Vouchers: Reroll Surplus ($10)\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nMy main strategy is Five of a Kind with 5 Aces. Based on my previous reasoning, Splash would be extremely powerful because:\n\n1. Normally, when playing cards, only the cards that participate in the scoring hand contribute chips\n2. With Splash, ALL played cards count in scoring\n3. This means all 5 Aces would score when I play Five of a Kind\n\nLet me calculate the potential scoring with Splash:\n- Base Five of a Kind: 155 chips, 15 mult\n- Each Ace: 11 base chips + 20 from Scholar = 31 chips, +4 mult from Scholar\n- First Ace gets retriggered 2 times by Hanging Chad (3 total triggers)\n- Jolly Joker adds +8 mult since Five of a Kind contains a Pair\n\nScoring sequence:\n1. Base hand: 155 chips, 15 mult\n\n\n2. First Ace scores 3 times: 3 × (31 chips + 4 mult) = 93 chips, +12 mult\n3. Other 4 Aces score once each: 4 × (31 chips + 4 mult) = 124 chips, +16 mult\n4. Jolly Joker: +8 mult\n\nTotal: 155 + 93 + 124 = 372 chips with 51 mult, giving 18,972 chips. This is nearly 3x my current scoring of 6,501 chips!\n\nSplash is the clear choice here. With $38 available and a $3 cost, I'll have $35 remaining. After purchasing it, I could explore High Priestess ($3), Arcana Pack ($4), Reroll Surplus ($10), or another reroll ($6), but acquiring Splash takes priority.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
