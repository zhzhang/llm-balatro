{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2 (Small Blind)\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Money: $0\n- Jokers: Drunkard (+1 discard), Ice Cream (+100 chips, -5 per hand), Jolly Joker (+8 mult if hand contains a pair)\n\n**Blind Options:**\n1. Small Blind: 800 chips needed, Reward: $3, Skip tag: Coupon Tag (free cards and boosters in next shop)\n2. Big Blind: 1200 chips needed, Reward: $4, Skip tag: Boss Tag (rerolls Boss Blind)\n3. Boss Blind: 1600 chips needed, Reward: $5, Description: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\"\n\n**My Current Power:**\nLet me calculate what I can score with my current jokers:\n\nFlush with a pair (most likely scenario):\n- Base chips: 35\n- Card chips: approximately 40 (5 cards × ~8 chips average)\n- Ice Cream: +100 chips (first hand), then +95, +90, +85, +80, etc. (decreases by 5 each hand)\n- Total chips first hand: 35 + 40 + 100 = 175 chips\n- Base mult: 4\n- Jolly Joker: +8 mult (if I have a pair in my flush)\n- Total mult: 4 + 8 = 12\n- Total score: 175 × 12 = 2,100 chips\n\nThat's enough for the Small Blind in ONE hand! \n\nFor subsequent hands, Ice Cream decreases by 5 each time:\n- Second hand: 35 + 40 + 95 = 170 × 12 = 2,040 chips\n\n\n- Third hand: 35 + 40 + 90 = 165 × 12 = 1,980 chips\n\nMy scoring stays well above what I need even as Ice Cream's bonus diminishes. The Coupon Tag would be nice, but I'm broke anyway, so skipping doesn't help me right now. Playing the Small Blind nets me $3 to spend later, and I should avoid the Boss Blind until I've built up more resources and money.\n\nThe command is: play_round","action":"\"play_round\""}
