{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n4. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n5. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n6. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Blind: Big Blind needing 7,500 chips\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n- Money: $25\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Available Hands to Make:**\n- Pair of Aces (positions 3, 4) - This would be a strong play\n- Pair of Queens (positions 1, 5)\n- Flush (3 clubs: positions 3, 4, 5, 6)\n\nLet me calculate what I could score with a pair of Aces:\n\n**Pair of Aces Play (positions 3, 4):**\n\nWith Splash, ALL played cards count in scoring, so I should play more cards to maximize score.\n\nLet me think about playing all 5 cards with the pair of Aces:\n- Positions 3, 4 (Ace of Clubs pair)\n- I should add more cards to maximize scoring with Splash\n\nActually, let me recalculate. \n\nSince Splash makes every card count toward scoring, I want to include as many cards as possible. Playing positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 gives me a pair of Aces plus three additional cards (Queen, 10, King). The pair scores 10 base chips with 2 mult, and with Splash active, all five cards contribute their individual chip values to the total.\n\nThe Aces each give 11 chips, while the Queen, 10, and King each contribute 10 chips, totaling 52 chips from the cards themselves. Hanging Chad then retriggers the first card in the scoring sequence—the Ace of Clubs—two additional times. Since that Ace also triggers Scholar, each retrigger adds 20 chips and 4 mult, meaning the retriggered Ace generates 93 chips across its three total activations. 4×3 (Ace #1 with retriggers) + 4 (Ace #2) + 8 (Jolly Joker for pair) = 2 + 12 + 4 + 8 = 26 mult\n\nTotal: 164 × 26 = 4,264 chips\n\nThat falls short of the 7,500 target. I need to explore other options. With 4 Aces still in the deck and 44 cards remaining, discarding the weaker cards could help me draw something more valuable to boost my score.\n\nI'll drop the Jack, 10, King, and 8 from positions 2, 6, 7, and 8.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,6,7,8]"}
