{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5 (Still in round 5, just advanced to Ante 3)\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round, Payout increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\nMax Jokers: 5 (I have 4, can buy 1 more)\n\n**Shop Options:**\nCards:\n1. Stuntman: +250 Chips, -2 hand size. Cost: $7\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack: $6\n2. Standard Pack: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Planet Merchant: Planet cards appear 2X more frequently in the shop. Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $2, which severely limits my options:\n- Can't buy Stuntman ($7)\n- Can't buy either booster pack ($6 or $4)\n- Can't buy the voucher ($10)\n- Can't reroll ($5)\n\nMy only real option is to proceed to round select with my current setup. I just bought Rocket, which will give me $1 at the end of each round (and increases by $2 when I beat boss blinds).\n\nLooking at Ante 3, the chip requirements will be significantly higher. My pair-based strategy has been working well so far, with scores ranging from 380 to 1,300 chips on pairs. With my current joker setup:\n- Jolly Joker: +8 Mult for pairs\n\n\n- Hanging Chad: Retriggers first played card 2 times\n- Photograph: X2 Mult for first face card\n- Rocket: Economy joker for long-term value\n\nSince I can't afford anything in the shop, I'll move to round select to see what the next blind requires. The Rocket will help me accumulate funds over the coming rounds for future purchases.","action":"\"round_select\""}
