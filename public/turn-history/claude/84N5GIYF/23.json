{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 3\n- Current Blind: Small Blind\n- Chips Needed: 800\n- Money: $0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 5\n- Current Chips: 0\n\n**My Hand:**\n1. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n2. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n3. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n5. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n6. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. 8 of Diamonds (+8 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Drunkard: +1 discard per round\n2. Ice Cream: +100 Chips, -5 chips for every hand played\n3. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n\n**Strategy:**\nI've been successfully playing Flushes in previous rounds. Looking at my current hand:\n- Hearts: Ace, Jack, 8, 7 (4 cards)\n- Clubs: 10, 3 (2 cards)\n- Spades: 4 (1 card)\n- Diamonds: 8 (1 card)\n\nI have 4 Hearts, so I'm one card away from a flush. I also have a pair of 8s (8 of Hearts and 8 of Diamonds).\n\n**Best Move:**\nI should discard the cards that don't fit my flush strategy and try to draw into a 5th heart. Let me discard the non-hearts:\n- 4 of Spades\n- 10 of Clubs\n- 3 of Clubs\n\n\n- 8 of Diamonds\n\nThis gives me 4 discards. I'll keep the 4 hearts (Ace, Jack, 8, 7) and hope to draw another heart.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. I have a pair of 8s right now. If I play the pair, I can get 126 chips from the base hand value plus Ice Cream bonus, and the Jolly Joker triggers on the pair to add 8 multiplier. This might be worth calculating more carefully against the flush draw.\n\nBut that feels like I'm wasting the Ice Cream bonus on a relatively weak hand. A flush would be much stronger and make better use of that bonus. With 4 hearts already in hand, I have about a 20% chance per draw of hitting another heart from the remaining deck. Discarding 4 cards gives me 4 chances to complete the flush, which is a reasonable shot.\n\nI'll discard the 4 of Spades, 10 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, and 8 of Diamonds to maximize my chances of drawing a fifth heart.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [1,6,7,8]"}
