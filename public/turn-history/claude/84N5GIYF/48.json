{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state carefully.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Boss Blind: All Club cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 4\n- Current Money: $12\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n4. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n5. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n6. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n7. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n8. 5 of Diamonds (+5 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n\n**Possible Hands in Current Hand:**\n- Pair of 7s: 7 of Hearts and 7 of Diamonds\n- Pair of 6s: 6 of Hearts and 6 of Diamonds  \n- Pair of 5s: 5 of Spades and 5 of Diamonds\n- Two pair: 7s and 6s, or 7s and 5s, or 6s and 5s\n- Flush: 3 Spades (Jack, 10, 5) - not enough for a flush\n\n**Best Option Analysis:**\n\nLet me calculate what I can get with different plays:\n\n\nPlaying the pair of 7s gives me a base of 10 chips with 2 mult. The 7 of Hearts contributes 7 chips and the 7 of Diamonds adds another 7, bringing me to 24 chips. Jolly Joker boosts this to 10 mult, and Hanging Chad retriggers the first card twice, meaning the 7 of Hearts scores three times total for 21 additional chips, reaching 45 chips total.\n\nMultiplying by the multiplier: 45 × 10 = 450 chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the triggering sequence. Hanging Chad retriggers the first card played, so if I lead with 7H then 7D:\n\nThe pair scores 10 chips with 2x multiplier. The 7H adds 7 chips, then Hanging Chad triggers it twice more for 7 additional chips each time, bringing me to 31 chips. Playing the 7D adds another 7 for 38 chips. Jolly Joker boosts the multiplier to 10x, giving 380 chips total.\n\nFor a pair of 6s, I'd get 36 chips × 10 = 360 chips. A pair of 5s yields 35 × 10 = 350 chips. The Jack of Spades would benefit from Photograph's 2x multiplier, but I don't have a second Jack to form a pair with it.\n\nWhat about playing two pair instead? If I play 7s and 6s together, the base two pair hand gives 20 chips with 2x multiplier. The 7H contributes 7 chips, Hanging Chad retriggers it twice for 14 more, the 7D adds 7, and the 6H and 6D each add 6, totaling 60 chips. Since two pair contains a pair, Jolly Joker applies its +8 multiplier bonus, bringing me to 10x total. That's 600 chips—significantly better than any single pair option.\n\nBut I should verify whether Photograph triggers. The 7H is my first card, and it's not a face card, so Photograph won't activate here. Given that I need 1,000 chips per hand on average to reach 4,000 total, I'm wondering if I should pursue a different approach using the Jack of Spades to unlock Photograph's X2 multiplier instead. ~600 chips, or I could discard some cards to try to get better cards.\n\nWith 4 hands and 4 discards available, I should prioritize discarding low-value singletons to improve my chances of drawing pairs or face cards that work with Photograph. The 10 of Spades and one of the 5s seem like candidates, but I need to be careful—the 5 of Spades and 5 of Diamonds actually form a pair, so discarding both would be wasteful. I should focus on keeping my existing pairs like the 7s and consider what would give me the most value if I draw well. I have 4 discards to work with, so I should leverage them strategically. Two pair gives me around 600 chips, but I need closer to 1000 per hand to stay on pace. Looking back at successful hands, I scored 1200 chips when I had a pair paired with a face card and used Photograph's X2 multiplier. That suggests I should aim for a stronger hand composition rather than just playing what I have now. I'll discard the singleton 10S and the weak 5S and 5D pair to chase another Jack or face card that could combine with my remaining pair for better scoring potential.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,8]"}
