{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 2\n- In BUFFOON_PACK phase - need to select 1 joker from 4 options\n- Money: $0\n- Current Jokers: Drunkard (+1 discard), Ice Cream (+100 chips, -5 per hand)\n- Max Jokers: 5 (3 slots available)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Vampire - Gains X0.1 Mult per scoring Enhanced card played, removes Enhancement (Currently X1 Mult)\n2. Greedy Joker - Played cards with Diamond suit give +3 Mult when scored\n3. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n4. Square Joker - Gains +4 Chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards (Currently 0 Chips)\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI've been playing Flush hands successfully (played 4 flushes so far). With Ice Cream, I'm getting great chip bonuses.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Vampire** - X0.1 Mult per Enhanced card, but removes Enhancement\n   - This is problematic because it removes enhancements, which could hurt long-term\n   - I don't have Enhanced cards yet anyway\n   - Starts at X1 Mult, needs to build up\n   - Not ideal for my current strategy\n\n2. **Greedy Joker** - +3 Mult for Diamond cards\n   - Only works for Diamonds\n   - I play flushes, so I'd need 5 Diamonds to get +15 Mult\n   - Additive mult (+15 total if 5 diamonds)\n   - Conditional on suit availability\n\n3. **Jolly Joker** - +8 Mult if hand contains a Pair\n   - A flush can contain a pair! This is important\n   - Solid additive bonus that triggers consistently with my flush strategy since I can get matching ranks\n   - Reliable as long as I have a pair in hand\n\n4. **Square Joker** - +4 Chips per hand with exactly 4 cards\n   - I play 5-card flushes, so this doesn't help me\n   - Would need to change strategy to play 4-card hands\n   - Not compatible with my current approach\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nJolly Joker is the clear winner. It synergizes perfectly with my flush strategy—I can easily include a pair within a 5-card flush, giving me consistent +8 Mult without changing my playstyle. The other options either require specific conditions I can't reliably meet or would force me to abandon my successful approach.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3]"}
