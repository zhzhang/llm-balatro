{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 2/8, Round: 4\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT (Boss Blind)\n- Chips Needed: 1600\n- Current Money: $1\n- Boss Description: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\"\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe boss blind says \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\". This is likely \"The Serpent\" boss which draws 7 cards face down at the start of the round. This means I won't be able to see what those 7 cards are when making decisions about which cards to play.\n\nThis is a challenging boss because:\n1. I can't see the face-down cards\n2. It makes it harder to identify pairs, especially pairs of face cards\n3. My strategy relies on playing pairs with face cards to maximize the synergy between Jolly Joker, Hanging Chad, and Photograph\n\nHowever, I need to play this round - boss blinds cannot be skipped. The chips needed is 1600, which is reasonable for my current setup.\n\nLet me estimate my scoring potential:\n- Playing a pair of face cards (like two Kings) with one face card first:\n  - Base chips: 10 (pair base) + 10 (first King) + 10 (second King) = 30 chips\n  - Hanging Chad retriggers first King 2 more times: +10 chips x 2 = +20 chips\n  - Total chips: 50 chips\n  \n  - Base mult: 2 (pair base)\n  - Jolly Joker: +8 Mult (for pair) = 10 mult\n  - Photograph: X2 Mult (for first face card) = 20 mult\n  - Total: 50 chips × 20 mult = 1000 chips\n\nThat's solid scoring per hand. With 3-4 hands available, I should comfortably exceed the 1600 chip requirement despite the face-down handicap. I need to rearrange my jokers to ensure the first face card triggers Photograph before the pair bonus applies.\n\nThe scoring sequence matters: Blind effects, then 'on played' jokers, then card scoring left-to-right, then 'on scored' jokers, retriggers, and finally independent jokers. Since Photograph triggers when a face card scores and Hanging Chad retriggers the first card, Photograph needs to activate before the retrigger happens. Jolly Joker's pair bonus comes last as an independent effect. Positioning Photograph leftmost ensures it multiplies the first face card before Hanging Chad duplicates that scoring. first face card scores. Photograph needs to be leftmost so it activates before other effects take hold. Hanging Chad's position is irrelevant since it retriggers the card during its own step regardless. Jolly Joker should sit last to accumulate all the multiplier bonuses that build up. The current arrangement has them backwards—I should move Photograph to the left, keep Hanging Chad in the middle, and place Jolly Joker on the right. Photograph triggers during the \"on scored\" phase while Jolly Joker activates in the \"independent\" phase, so their positions relative to each other matter for the final multiplier calculation. 't matter for the final calculation.\n\nSince these jokers activate in different steps of the scoring process, their relative positioning doesn't affect the outcome. I'll proceed with the current setup.","action":"\"play_round\""}
