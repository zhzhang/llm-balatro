{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3 (Big Blind)\n- In BLIND_SELECT phase\n- Money: $0\n- Jokers: Jolly Joker (+8 mult for pairs), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card 2 times)\n- No consumables\n\n**Big Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 1,200\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Boss Tag (Rerolls the Boss Blind)\n\n**Boss Blind (upcoming):**\n- Chips Needed: 1,600\n- Boss Description: \"in 7 cards get drawn face down\" (This seems incomplete but likely means some cards are drawn face down, making it harder to identify them)\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Last Played Hand:**\n- Pair - 1,300 chips (on Ante 2, Small Blind)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Can I beat the Big Blind?**\n   - I need 1,200 chips\n   - My last pair scored 1,300 chips on the Small Blind\n   - I have upgraded my King to Ace and one 9 to 10 using Strength tarot\n   - With Jolly Joker (+8 mult for pairs) and Hanging Chad (retrigger first card 2 times), I should be able to score well\n   - A pair should be feasible to find and should score around 1,300+ chips\n\n2. **Should I skip for the Boss Tag?**\n   - Boss Tag allows rerolling the Boss Blind\n   - The upcoming boss blind has cards drawn face down, which could be challenging\n   - However, I just beat the Small Blind easily with 1,300 chips\n   - Skipping means I won't get the $4 reward and won't have a chance to shop before the boss\n   - Boss Tag is valuable for rerolling difficult bosses\n   \nPlaying the Big Blind gives me $4 plus additional money from remaining hands and interest, which I can use to shop before facing the boss. Skipping grants the Boss Tag for rerolling but leaves me with $0 going into the boss encounter with no purchasing power.\n\nThe boss blind's face-down card mechanic could complicate hand identification, but having resources to buy additional jokers or consumables beforehand would help me prepare. Since I just scored 1,300 chips on the Small Blind—above the 1,200 threshold—I should play to secure the financial advantage and shop opportunities before the final challenge.","action":"\"play_round\""}
