{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- I'm in the SHOP phase after successfully beating the Small Blind\n- Current Money: $47\n- I just played Five of a Kind and scored 6,501 chips, which was way more than the 5,000 needed!\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n5. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +1 Mult)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\nCards:\n1. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored ($4)\n2. Crafty Joker - +80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush ($4)\n\nBoosters:\n1. Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Tarot cards to be used immediately ($4)\n2. Celestial Pack - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards to be used immediately ($4)\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less ($10)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Scholar joker looks extremely strong! I've been playing a lot of Aces (I just played a Five of a Kind with 5 Aces). Looking at my last hand:\n- Five of a Kind scored 6,501 chips\n- With Scholar, each Ace would give +20 chips and +4 mult when scored\n- With Hanging Chad retriggering the first Ace twice, that's 3 activations of the first Ace\n\n\n- If I play 5 Aces with Scholar and Hanging Chad, the first Ace alone generates 93 chips and 12 mult across its three triggers, while the remaining four Aces contribute 124 chips and 16 mult, totaling 217 bonus chips and 28 bonus mult on top of the base Five of a Kind's 120 chips and 12 mult.\n\nScholar at $4 is a clear win since it amplifies my Ace-focused strategy and pairs perfectly with Hanging Chad's retriggering effect. Crafty Joker doesn't fit my current playstyle, but the Celestial Pack could level up Five of a Kind, which would be valuable. Reroll Surplus is too expensive at $10. I'll buy Scholar and have $43 left to potentially grab the Celestial Pack afterward.\n\nBut I'm at max joker capacity with 5 cards, so I need to sell something first. Jolly Joker is the weakest link—I'm not building around Pairs anymore, and it only sells for $1. Hanging Chad is too valuable to lose given how it synergizes with Scholar. Photograph doesn't fit my strategy without face cards. Rocket generates solid income. Green Joker provides consistent scaling. Selling Jolly Joker makes the most sense.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [3]"}
