{"reasoning":"Looking at the current situation:\n\n1. I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK phase where I need to select a joker from 2 options\n2. My previous action failed - I tried to \"select 1\" but got the error \"Cannot select this pack card. Please try a different selection.\"\n3. I have 5 jokers (at max capacity)\n\nThe two options are:\n1. Mime - Retrigger all card held in hand abilities\n2. Driver's License - X3 Mult if I have at least 16 Enhanced cards in my full deck (Currently 2)\n\nThe error message says I cannot select the pack card. This is likely because I'm at max joker capacity (5/5). In Balatro, when you're at max capacity, you need to make room by selling a joker before you can select a new one from a pack.\n\nSo the issue is clear: I need to sell a joker first before I can select from the pack.\n\nLooking at my current jokers:\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair (Common, $1)\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times (Common, $2)\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round (Uncommon, $3)\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored (Common, $2)\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring (Common, $1)\n\nIf I want to take Mime, I should sell the weakest joker. Jolly Joker seems weakest - it only gives +8 Mult for pairs, which is decent but not amazing.\n\nIf I want to take Driver's License, I'd need to invest heavily in enhanced cards, which seems unrealistic at Ante 4/8.\n\nActually, I should reconsider whether I even want either of these jokers. \n\nMime only triggers held-in-hand abilities, which I don't currently have—it would only become useful if I acquire Steel cards or specific jokers later. Driver's License demands 16 enhanced cards when I only have 2, making it a massive commitment. I could skip the booster entirely, but I've already spent $4 on it, so abandoning it now would be wasteful. Between the two options, Mime has more potential upside if I manage to get the right cards down the line.\n\nDriver's License is nearly impossible to activate given my current setup. I'll sell Jolly Joker since it's my weakest joker at just +8 Mult for pairs, then take Mime.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
