{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n4. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n5. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n6. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n7. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n8. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n\n**Situation:**\n- Need 600 chips total\n- Current chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 2\n- Boss effect: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\n\n**What I have:**\nI have SIX SPADES! This is perfect for a Flush!\n- Ace of Spades (+11)\n- Queen of Spades (+10)\n- 10 of Spades (+10)\n- 8 of Spades (+8)\n- 7 of Spades (+7)\n- 6 of Spades (+6)\n\n**Calculating Flush score:**\nI should play 5 of the 6 Spades for a Flush. I want to maximize chip value, so I should play the 5 highest value Spades:\n1. Ace of Spades (+11)\n2. Queen of Spades (+10)\n3. 10 of Spades (+10)\n4. 8 of Spades (+8)\n5. 7 of Spades (+7)\n\nBase chips for Flush: 35\nCard chips: 11 + 10 + 10 + 8 + 7 = 46\nTotal chips: 35 + 46 = 81\nBase mult: 4\nTotal score: 81 × 4 = 324 chips\n\n\nLet me verify this against the previous Flush hands that scored 272 chips. I need to double-check which cards actually contribute to the chip total—only the 5 cards in the Flush itself count toward the chip value, not the discarded ones.\n\nFor the Ace-Queen-10-8-7 of Spades combination, the card values sum to 46 chips. Combined with the 35 base chips for a Flush and multiplied by the 4x multiplier, that gives 324 chips total. Since I have 4 hands left and need 600 chips, scoring 324 twice would put me over the threshold. The boss mechanic discards cards from the deck rather than my hand, so it won't interfere with my current play. I'll go ahead and play this Flush.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,3,4,5]"}
