{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in a PLANET_PACK phase where I need to choose 1 of 3 planet cards\n- Money: $4\n- Owned Jokers: Drunkard (+1 discard per round)\n- Next blind: Boss Blind requiring 600 chips\n\n**Pack Choices:**\n1. Neptune - Levels up Straight Flush (+4 Mult and +40 chips) - Currently level 1: 100 chips, 8 mult\n2. Mars - Levels up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips) - Currently level 1: 60 chips, 7 mult\n3. Mercury - Levels up Pair (+1 Mult and +15 chips) - Currently level 1: 10 chips, 2 mult\n\n**What I Need:**\n- Boss Blind requires 600 chips with 4 hands available\n- I've been successfully playing Flushes (272 chips each)\n- Two flushes = 544 chips, so I need about 56 more chips from remaining hands\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWait, I notice something important - NONE of these planet cards level up Flush, which is what I've been playing! This is unfortunate. Let me reconsider my options:\n\n1. **Neptune (Straight Flush)**: This would level up Straight Flush from 100/8 to 140/12. Straight Flush is very hard to make - it requires 5 cards in sequence AND all the same suit. This is much harder than a regular flush. Unlikely to help me in the Boss Blind.\n\n2. **Mars (Four of a Kind)**: This would level up Four of a Kind from 60/7 to 90/10. Four of a kind requires 4 cards of the same rank. This is also quite difficult to make consistently, though more realistic than Straight Flush.\n\n3. **Mercury (Pair)**: This would level up Pair from 10/2 to 25/3. \n\nPairs are the easiest hand to form consistently. If I upgrade Mercury, a pair would score around 135 chips (25 base + 20 from two cards × 3 mult), but even playing 4 pairs only nets 540 chips—still short of 600. Mars offers better scaling with Four of a Kind at level 2 (90 chips, 10 mult), which could yield 200+ chips per hand if I can assemble the cards, though that's a tall order with limited hands remaining.\n\nNeptune's Straight Flush is the most powerful option—a level 2 version would generate roughly 2160 chips with just one hand, easily clearing the Boss Blind. The challenge is whether I can reliably construct a five-card straight flush given my current deck composition and remaining plays.\n\nI'm working with 4 hands and 4 discards total in this final round. Pairs are my most consistent play, Four of a Kind is possible but requires careful discard management, and Straight Flush demands both luck and precise card sequencing. Since I've been successfully building regular flushes throughout the run and they're generating solid returns at 272 chips each, I should evaluate whether sticking with that proven strategy makes more sense than gambling on a hand type I haven't been constructing. the better choice because one successful Four of a Kind would easily exceed the blind, and with multiple hands and discards, I have several opportunities to assemble it. Even if that fails, I can fall back on pairs or three of a kind. Mars gives me the highest ceiling while still preserving a safety net with my existing Flush strategy if the Four of a Kind doesn't materialize.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
