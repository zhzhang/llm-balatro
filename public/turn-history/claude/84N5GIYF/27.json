{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3\n- Just finished the Small Blind and I'm in the shop\n- Money: $6\n- Ice Cream now at +95 chips (lost 5 from playing one hand)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Drunkard (+1 discard each round)\n2. Ice Cream (+95 chips, will continue to decrease)\n3. Jolly Joker (+8 mult for pairs)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\n**Cards:**\n1. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times - $4\n2. Invisible Joker - After 2 rounds, duplicate a random joker - $8 (can't afford)\n\n**Boosters:**\n1. Jumbo Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of 5 Tarot cards - $6\n2. Standard Pack - Choose 1 of 3 playing cards - $4\n\n**Voucher:**\n1. Hone - Foil/Holographic/Polychrome appear 2x more often - $10 (can't afford)\n\n**Reroll Cost:** $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith $6, I can afford:\n- Hanging Chad ($4) \n- Jumbo Arcana Pack ($6)\n- Standard Pack ($4)\n- Reroll ($5)\n\nLet me think about what would be most valuable:\n\n1. **Hanging Chad** ($4) - This retriggers the first played card 2 additional times. This could be very powerful if I'm playing high-value cards or enhanced cards. It would trigger before other jokers, so it could multiply the effect of cards significantly. For $4, this seems like a solid value.\n\n2. **Jumbo Arcana Pack** ($6) - Tarot cards can enhance playing cards or modify jokers. This could be useful for upgrading my deck, but I'd spend all my money.\n\n\n3. **Standard Pack** ($4) - Adding a playing card is typically less impactful than jokers or tarot effects. 4. **Reroll** ($5) - I'd only have $1 left, limiting future flexibility.\n\nHanging Chad synergizes well with my pair-focused strategy using Jolly Joker. Retriggering the first card twice means three total activations, which compounds significantly with high-value cards. Meanwhile, Ice Cream's declining value each hand means I need to generate chips through other means soon.\n\nThe Jumbo Arcana Pack offers tempting options like The Magician for Lucky cards, The Hermit to double money, or The Chariot and Devil for Steel and Gold enhancements. But I'm already at the shop after the Small Blind with two more blinds remaining this ante, so I need to decide quickly. Hanging Chad at $4 leaves me with $2 and could provide the multiplicative boost I need as I progress through the remaining antes.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
