With difficulty increasing at Ante 4/8, I need to strengthen my synergies. My current strategy revolves around pairs triggering Jolly Joker, Hanging Chad retriggering my first card, and Photograph multiplying face cards. Green Joker could work well since I'm playing hands frequently and not discarding much, so it should stay positive. Wrathful Joker adds another mult source if I'm playing spades. The Jumbo Arcana Pack offers flexibility to grab a useful tarot effect immediately. d Wrathful Joker ($5) for $9 total, leaving me with $34. Green Joker offers reliable scaling since I play more hands than I discard, making it a strong value pick at just $4. The other options—Jumbo Arcana Pack for deck enhancement, Reroll Surplus to reduce reroll costs, or spending $5 to reroll now—are less immediately impactful. Given that I'm at the midpoint of the game and difficulty will spike significantly, I should prioritize permanent multiplicative growth over situational effects or flexibility. have $39 left. The Jumbo Arcana Pack could provide immediate power through enhancements like Steel cards for chip scaling or Tarot effects, but I'm also considering a reroll to find better jokers. At Ante 4, I need to balance scaling potential with meeting the higher chip requirements. Green Joker fills my last slot and grows stronger over time, so committing to it makes sense, then I can decide whether to invest in card enhancements or preserve resources for future rounds.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
