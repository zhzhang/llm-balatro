{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3 (just finished Small Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $4\n- Just sold Ice Cream joker\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Drunkard: +1 discard each round (sells for $2)\n2. Jolly Joker: +8 mult for pairs (sells for $1)\n3. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times (sells for $2)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Invisible Joker: $8 (need $4 more)\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: $6 (need $2 more)\n- Standard Pack: $4 (can afford!)\n- Hone Voucher: $10 (need $6 more)\n- Reroll: $5 (need $1 more)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWith $4, I can afford:\n1. Standard Pack ($4) - adds one playing card to deck\n2. Or sell another joker to get more money\n\nLooking at my previous reasoning, I mentioned wanting to get the Jumbo Arcana Pack for powerful tarot effects like The Devil (Gold enhancement), The Lovers (Wild card), The Magician (Lucky card), etc. These would synergize well with Hanging Chad's retriggering ability.\n\nIf I sell Drunkard for $2 more, I'd have $6 total, which would let me buy the Jumbo Arcana Pack.\n\nLet me evaluate:\n- Drunkard gives +1 discard per round, which is useful for finding the right cards\n- Jolly Joker gives +8 mult for pairs, which is my core strategy\n- Hanging Chad retriggers first card 2 additional times, which is very powerful\n\nThe question is: Is Drunkard worth keeping, or should I trade it for the Jumbo Arcana Pack?\n\n\nSelling Drunkard would free up funds for the Jumbo Arcana Pack. The extra discard is helpful but not critical, whereas enhanced cards become exponentially more valuable with Hanging Chad's retriggering. A Gold card would generate $9 instead of $3, and a Lucky card's bonus multiplies significantly across three activations rather than one.\n\nThe Standard Pack is cheaper but offers less control—the Arcana Pack lets me select from five Tarot cards, guaranteeing synergy with my current setup. This seems like the stronger move: trade the Drunkard for $2, bringing me to $6, then purchase the Jumbo Arcana Pack to unlock those multiplicative effects.","action":"\"sell_joker\"\nPositions: [1]"}
