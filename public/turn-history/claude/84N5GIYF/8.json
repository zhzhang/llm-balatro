{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Shop phase\n- Money: $8\n- Owned Jokers: Drunkard (+1 discard each round)\n- Next blind: Boss Blind requiring 600 chips\n- I've sold Luchador, which should have disabled the Boss Blind effect\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Loyalty Card - $5 - \"X4 Mult every 6 hands played, 5 remaining\"\n2. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n3. Reroll Surplus voucher - $10 - Rerolls cost $2 less\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI've been playing Flushes successfully (272 chips each). The Boss Blind requires 600 chips with 4 hands available.\n\nCurrent Flush scoring:\n- Base: 35 chips, 4 mult\n- With 5 cards in the flush, each card adds chips (let's assume face cards ~10 chips each)\n- 272 chips means: (35 + card chips) × 4 mult ≈ 272\n- So roughly: (35 + 33) × 4 = 272\n\nIf I level up Flush with a Celestial Pack:\n- Level 2 Flush would be higher base chips and mult\n- This would push each flush above 272, potentially to 350-400 chips\n- Two leveled flushes could get me close to or over 600 chips\n\n**Options:**\n1. Buy Celestial Pack ($4) - Level up Flush, leaves me with $4\n2. Buy Loyalty Card ($5) - Won't trigger in Boss Blind (needs 6 hands, only 4 available)\n3. Reroll shop ($5) - Could find better options\n4. Go to round select immediately\n\n**Best Strategy:**\n\nThe Celestial Pack for $4 is the clear choice here. Leveling up Flush will:\n\n\n- Boost the base chips and multiplier on each flush I play\n- Combined with Drunkard's extra discard, I'll have better odds of forming flushes consistently\n- Two upgraded flushes should push me past the 600-chip threshold needed\n\nThe Loyalty Card won't activate during the Boss Blind since it requires 6 hands and I only get 4. Reroll Surplus is too pricey for immediate value. I'll grab the Celestial Pack, upgrade Flush, and head into the blind with $4 remaining.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
