{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 9\n- Boss Blind: Start with 0 discards\n- Chips Needed: 10,000\n- Current Chips: 4,715 (after playing the three Aces hand)\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 0\n- Money: $34\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n2. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3. 3 of Spades (+3 chips)\n4. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n5. 8 of Hearts (+8 chips)\n6. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n7. 4 of Hearts (+4 chips)\n8. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n2. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, +$2 when Boss defeated\n3. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n4. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mime - Retrigger all card held in hand abilities\n\n**What I need:**\nI need 10,000 - 4,715 = 5,285 more chips with 3 hands remaining.\n\n**Analysis of current hand:**\n\nLooking at suits:\n- Spades: 7, 5, 3 (3 cards)\n- Hearts: Ace, 8, 7, 4 (4 cards)\n- Clubs: 6 (1 card)\n\nLooking at ranks:\n- 7s: Spades, Hearts (pair)\n- All other ranks appear once\n\nPossible hands:\n1. **Flush (Hearts):** I could play 5 hearts for a flush. \n\nI only have 4 hearts available, so a flush won't work. The pair of 7s gives me a base of 10 chips with 2x multiplier at Level 1. I should consider playing the pair alongside other cards to maximize Scholar's bonus on the Ace, since that gives +20 chips and +4 mult when the Ace scores.\n\nWith Splash active, all 5 cards I play will contribute. The 7 of Spades gets retriggered twice by Hanging Chad, so it scores 3 times total (21 chips). Adding the Ace of Hearts with Scholar gives me 31 chips from that card alone, plus the pair's base value and multiplier.\n\nLet me work through the full hand: 10 base chips, 21 from the retriggered 7♠, 7 from the 7♥ in the pair, 31 from the Ace with Scholar's bonus, and 13 from two additional cards (8♥ and 5♠). That's 82 chips total with a 6x multiplier, giving me 492 chips. This is clearly not enough.\n\nI should try a different approach—playing 5 cards that include the Ace to better leverage Scholar's multiplier bonus. Let me position the Ace of Hearts at position 4, with the 8 of Hearts at position 5, and keep the 7 of Spades in the mix.\n\nWith the 7♠ at position 1, 5♠ at position 2, and 3♠ at position 3, I'd have a High Card hand. The Ace triggers Scholar three times, generating 33 chips from the card itself and 60 additional chips from Scholar's effect, plus 12 multiplier. The remaining cards contribute 23 chips. This totals 121 chips with 13x multiplier, reaching 1,573 chips.\n\nThat's still short of the 5,285 I need. I'm realizing my situation has changed significantly—my previous hand with three Aces scored 4,715 chips, but now I only have one Ace available. With three hands left, I need roughly 1,762 chips per hand on average. Looking at my scoring patterns, a single Ace in a High Card won't come close to matching what a Three of a Kind with multiple Aces could achieve.\n\nLet me work through the actual hand I'm holding. If I lead with the Ace and arrange the remaining cards (7♠, 8♥, 7♥, 5♠), I'd form a Pair of 7s. The Ace would trigger Scholar bonuses through Hanging Chad, giving me around 93 chips from the retriggered Aces plus the base pair value and kicker cards. This gets me closer to what I need, but I'm still looking at a hand that falls well short of my target. The Ace needs to be played first to trigger Hanging Chad's retriggering effect, which will maximize Scholar's multiplier stacking. Playing in positions 4, 1, 6, 5, 2 gives me the pair of 7s while ensuring the Ace gets the most retriggering benefit, yielding around 1,820 chips.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [4,1,6,5,2]"}
