{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state:\n\nI just bought a Celestial Pack and now I need to choose one of three planet cards:\n1. Uranus - Level up Two Pair (+1 Mult and +20 chips)\n2. Mars - Level up Four of a Kind (+3 Mult and +30 chips)\n3. Jupiter - Level up Flush (+2 Mult and +15 chips)\n\nLooking at my hand history:\n- Pair: Played 6 times (most frequent)\n- Two Pair: Played 3 times\n- Flush: Played 4 times\n- Four of a Kind: Played 0 times (but it's already at Level 2 somehow)\n- Three of a Kind: Played 1 time\n\nMy jokers are optimized for pairs:\n- Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n- Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n- Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n\nGiven that:\n1. I play Pair the most (6 times)\n2. Two Pair is my second most common hand (3 times)\n3. Four of a Kind I haven't played at all\n4. Flush I've played 4 times but it's not synergistic with my pair-focused jokers\n\nTwo Pair contains a Pair, so it would trigger Jolly Joker's +8 Mult bonus. Upgrading Two Pair would improve a hand type I already use frequently and that synergizes with my joker setup.\n\nMars (Four of a Kind) would give a bigger boost (+3 Mult, +30 chips) but I haven't played it once yet, so it's not part of my current strategy.\n\nJupiter (Flush) I've played 4 times, but it doesn't synergize with my pair-focused jokers.\n\nUranus (Two Pair) seems like the best choice because:\n\n\n- I've already played it 3 times, so it's an established part of my strategy\n- It triggers Jolly Joker since Two Pair contains a Pair\n- The upgrade will strengthen a hand I'm already using regularly\n\nI should select Uranus (position 1).","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
