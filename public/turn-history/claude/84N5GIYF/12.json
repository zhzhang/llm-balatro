{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 1/8, Round 2\n- Boss Blind: \"Discards 2 random cards per hand played\"\n- Chips Needed: 600\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 5\n- Money: $4\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n3. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n4. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n6. Jack of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n7. 10 of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**Deck Composition:**\n- Diamonds: 10 cards\n- Hearts: 11 cards\n- Spades: 10 cards\n- Clubs: 13 cards\n\n**Hand Levels:**\n- Four of a Kind: Level 2, Base 90 chips, 10 mult\n- Flush: Level 1, Base 35 chips, 4 mult\n- Pair: Level 1, Base 10 chips, 2 mult\n- Two Pair: Level 1, Base 20 chips, 2 mult\n\n**What I can make with current hand:**\nLet me look at what hands I can form:\n\nSpades: Ace, 8, 6 (3 cards)\nHearts: Jack, 10 (2 cards)\nDiamonds: Jack, 10, 2 (3 cards)\n\nPairs:\n- Jack of Hearts and Jack of Diamonds = Pair of Jacks\n- 10 of Hearts and 10 of Diamonds = Pair of 10s\n\nTwo Pair:\n- Jacks and 10s = Two Pair\n\n\n- Playing Two Pair with the four face cards gives me (20 + 40) × 2 = 120 chips, which falls short of the 600 needed across four hands. I need to consider discarding strategically to build stronger hands, especially since the boss removes 2 random cards each time I play.\n\nA Flush would be valuable—I currently have three spades and could potentially draw more if I discard the non-spade cards. That would yield around 272 chips. Alternatively, I could pursue Four of a Kind by trying to collect four cards of the same rank, since I already have pairs of Jacks and 10s. Each hand I play triggers the boss's discard effect, so I need to maximize chip generation per play. Let me explore the Flush path more carefully—I have three spades in hand with ten remaining in the deck, so drawing five new cards gives me a reasonable chance of hitting additional spades for a complete hand.\n\nThe flush would score around 270+ chips based on my earlier calculation, so I should discard the non-spade cards in positions 4 through 8 (the Hearts, Diamonds) and draw fresh cards. This maximizes my odds of completing the flush on the next round.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [4,5,6,7,8]"}
