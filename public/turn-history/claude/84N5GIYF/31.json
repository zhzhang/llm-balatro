{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3\n- In TAROT_PACK phase (after buying Jumbo Arcana Pack)\n- Money: $0\n- Jokers: Jolly Joker (+8 mult for pairs), Hanging Chad (retrigger first card 2 times)\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Strength - Increases rank of up to 2 selected cards by 1\n2. The Star - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Diamonds\n3. The Hermit - Doubles money (Max $20) - Currently $0, so useless\n4. Temperance - Gives total sell value of jokers (Max $50) - Currently $3\n5. The Hanged Man - Destroys up to 2 selected cards\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. King of Hearts\n2. 9 of Hearts\n3. 6 of Hearts\n4. 8 of Clubs\n5. 7 of Clubs\n6. 4 of Clubs\n7. 9 of Diamonds\n8. 4 of Diamonds\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI was hoping for powerful enhancement cards like The Devil (Gold), The Lovers (Wild), or The Magician (Lucky), but none of those are in this pack.\n\nLet me evaluate the options:\n\n1. **Strength** - Increases rank by 1. This could turn my 9s into 10s, Kings into Aces, etc. With Hanging Chad, higher rank cards will score more chips when retriggered. This is moderately useful.\n\n2. **The Star** - Converts up to 3 cards to Diamonds. This could help build flushes, but I have mixed suits currently. With Hanging Chad retriggering, this could be useful for creating flush opportunities. Currently I have: 3 Hearts, 3 Clubs, 2 Diamonds.\n   \nThe Hermit and Temperance don't help much—doubling $0 is pointless, and getting $3 doesn't enhance my scoring. The Hanged Man could thin my deck but doesn't directly improve my hands. Since my strategy centers on pairs and retriggering, Strength is the clear winner—upgrading my 9s to 10s and my King to an Ace will maximize the value when Hanging Chad triggers them.\n\nThe Star presents an interesting alternative though. Converting three cards to Diamonds would give me five total, which could form a flush worth 35 chips plus 4 multiplier. But my recent hands show I've been relying on pairs for consistent damage, so pivoting to flushes seems risky at this point.\n\nGiven my Jolly Joker boosts pairs and Hanging Chad retriggered my first card, I should stick with upgrading cards that benefit from that synergy. Strength lets me push my King to an Ace and a 9 to a 10, both of which gain more value when retriggered. That's the move.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,1,2]"}
