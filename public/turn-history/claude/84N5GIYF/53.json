Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round\\n\\n**What I need:**\\n- I need 4000 - 600 = 3400 more chips\\n- I have 3 hands remaining\\n- I need to average about 1133 chips per hand\\n\\n**Analyzing my current hand:**\\nLooking at the cards:\\n- I don't have any pairs\\n- I have two Aces (Ace of Clubs is debuffed, Ace of Diamonds is active)\\n- I have a King of Diamonds (face card)\\n- No flush potential (4 Diamonds, 2 Spades, 1 Heart, 2 Clubs)\\n- No straight potential\\n\\nMy best options seem to be:\\n1. Discard some cards to try to draw pairs or better hands\\n\\n\\n2. Play a high card hand with the King of Diamonds leading to trigger Photograph\\n\\nIf I lead with the King of Diamonds, I'd get the base high card value of 5 chips plus 1 mult, then add the King's 10 chips. Hanging Chad would retrigger it twice more for an additional 20 chips. With Photograph doubling the multiplier on that face card, I'd end up with 35 chips total and 2x multiplier applied.\\n\\nThat gives me only 70 chips\\u2014clearly not enough. I need to discard and hunt for better cards. The two Club cards are completely dead weight due to the debuff, and the low cards like the 4 of Spades, 3 of Hearts, and 2 of Diamonds won't contribute much. I should hold onto the Ace of Diamonds, King of Diamonds, and 7 of Spades while discarding the weak cards to draw pairs or additional face cards that synergize better with my jokers.\\nCommand: discard 2 3 4 5 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 52]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 6\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Jolly Joker.

Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round\\n\\n**What I need:**\\n- I need 4000 - 600 = 3400 more chips\\n- I have 3 hands remaining\\n- I need to average about 1133 chips per hand\\n\\n**Analyzing my current hand:**\\n- I have a pair of Kings: King of Spades and King of Diamonds\\n- I have high-value face cards: Queen of Spades, Ace of Diamonds\\n- 3 debuffed Club cards (useless except for hand formation)\\n- 7 of Spades\\n\\n**Best Play Option:**\\n\\nIf I play the pair of Kings (King of Spades, King of Diamonds):\\n\\n\\n- Leading with King of Spades triggers Hanging Chad for 2 retriggered plays, and Photograph activates for X2 mult on the first face card\\n- The pair itself gives 10 chips with 2 mult, plus King of Diamonds adds another 10 chips\\n- This totals 50 chips before multipliers: 10 base + 10 (King of Spades) + 20 (retriggered) + 10 (King of Diamonds)\\n- Multiplier reaches 10x: 2 base + 8 from Jolly Joker for the pair, then X2 from Photograph\\n- This yields 50 \\u00d7 10 \\u00d7 2 = 1000 chips from this hand alone\\n\\nI'm considering whether adding more cards could improve the score. Playing King of Spades, Queen of Spades, King of Diamonds, and Ace of Diamonds keeps the pair intact while introducing additional face cards. The Kings still form the scoring pair with their base 10 chips and 2 mult, King of Spades retriggered twice for 30 chips total, and Photograph doubling the multiplier again. Queen and Ace don't contribute to the pair scoring but might offer other value through different card interactions.\\n\\nHowever, this approach yields the same 1000 chips as the simpler two-King configuration since only paired cards generate chips. The optimal play appears to be sticking with just the Kings\\u2014King of Spades and King of Diamonds\\u2014which delivers the 1000-chip result. That brings my running total to 1600 chips, leaving me needing 2400 more across the remaining two hands, averaging 1200 per hand.\\n\\nI could try discarding some Club cards to improve my draw, but with only two discards remaining and three hands left to play, it makes more sense to lock in this solid 1000-chip hand now rather than risk it.\\nCommand: play 1 8 pair 1000\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 53]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 6\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Jolly Joker.

The pair gives 10 base chips with 2 multiplier, then the Queen of Spades contributes 30 additional chips from the retriggered plays, and the Queen of Diamonds adds 10 more, totaling 50 chips from this hand.\\n\\nWith the multiplier stack\\u20142 base plus 8 from Jolly Joker for the pair, then doubled by Photograph\\u2014I'd reach 20x, giving me 1000 chips on this hand. Combined with my previous score, that puts me at 2800, still 1200 short with one hand remaining.\\n\\nI could also attempt a two pair using the Queens and 8s instead. The two pair base would give 20 chips and 2 multiplier, with the Queen of Spades retriggering twice for 30 additional chips, the Queen of Diamonds for 10 more, and the 8 of Spades for 8 chips, though the 8 of Clubs would be debuffed. The debuffed 8 of Clubs contributes zero chips but still qualifies for the hand type. Adding up: 20 base + 30 (Queen of Spades retriggered) + 10 (Queen of Diamonds) + 8 (8 of Spades) = 68 chips. With Jolly Joker's 8 multiplier plus Photograph's X2, I get 20 total multiplier, yielding 1360 chips. Combined with the 1800 from the Queens alone, that's 3160 chips\\u2014leaving 840 chips needed with my final hand.\\n\\nI should play this two pair now since it's my best option. I'll use Queen of Spades, 8 of Spades, Queen of Diamonds, and 8 of Clubs to lock in the score.\\n\\nLet me verify the math: Two Pair gives 20 base chips with 2x multiplier. The Queen of Spades triggers both Hanging Chad and Photograph, retriggering for 30 chips total. The 8 of Spades adds 8 chips, the Queen of Diamonds adds 10, and the debuffed 8 of Clubs contributes nothing. That's 68 chips before multipliers. With Jolly Joker adding 8 and Photograph doubling the multiplier, I get 10x that becomes 20x, resulting in 1360 chips. This hand is worth playing.\\nCommand: play 1 2 8 5 two pair 1360\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 3/8, Round: 6\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Jolly Joker.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Boss Blind: All Club cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 3432\n- Remaining hands: 1\n- Remaining discards: 2\n- Current Money: $12\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n2. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n3. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n4. Jack of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. King of Clubs (Debuffed - no chips, no abilities)\n6. 10 of Clubs (Debuffed - no chips, no abilities)\n7. 4 of Clubs (Debuffed - no chips, no abilities)\n8. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round\n\n**What I need:**\n- I need 4000 - 3432 = 568 more chips\n- I have 1 hand remaining\n- I need to score at least 568 chips in this final hand\n\n**Analyzing my current hand:**\n- I have a pair of Aces: Ace of Hearts (2 copies) and Ace of Diamonds\n- Actually, I have THREE Aces of Hearts and one Ace of Diamonds! That's a THREE OF A KIND!\n- Wait, let me recount: position 2 and 3 are both \"Ace of Hearts\", position 8 is \"Ace of Diamonds\"\n- So I have 2 Ace of Hearts and 1 Ace of Diamonds = 3 Aces total\n\n\n- The Jack of Hearts is also in my hand, and I have three debuffed Clubs that won't contribute anything.\n\nFor the three-of-a-kind play, if I lead with an Ace of Hearts, Hanging Chad will retrigger it twice for additional scoring. The Photograph joker won't apply since Aces aren't face cards, but the Jolly Joker will add 8 Mult to the hand. A three-of-a-kind scores 30 base chips with 3x multiplier, which gives me 90 chips before joker effects.\n\nIf I instead play the Jack of Hearts first, it triggers both Hanging Chad and Photograph for X2 Mult, but then I'd need to add the Aces to form the three-of-a-kind hand. The scoring would depend on which cards actually count toward the hand type and which ones just add chip values.\n\nLet me focus on a simpler approach with just a Pair of Aces. Playing two Aces of Hearts would give me the base pair scoring (10 chips, 2x mult), and the first Ace would retrigger Hanging Chad three times for 33 additional chips, while the second Ace contributes its 11 chip value. This seems more straightforward than trying to coordinate multiple card types. chips\n- Total chips: 30 (base) + 33 + 11 + 11 = 85 chips\n- Mult: 3 (base) + 8 (Jolly Joker)\n\nI need to verify if Jolly Joker triggers here. The card grants \"+8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\", and since Three of a Kind inherently contains a Pair within it, the bonus should apply.\n\n- Mult: 3 + 8 = 11\n- Total: 85 × 11 = 935 chips\n\nThis exceeds the 568 chip requirement."
