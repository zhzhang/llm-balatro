{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $41\n- Just upgraded Five of a Kind to Level 2 (155 chips, 15 mult)\n\n**My Jokers (5/5 slots):**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played (Currently +1 Mult)\n5. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards: Crafty Joker (+80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush) - $4\n- Boosters: Arcana Pack ($4)\n- Vouchers: Reroll Surplus ($10)\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nMy main strategy is playing Five of a Kind with 5 Aces, which synergizes perfectly with Scholar and Hanging Chad. I just scored 6,501 chips on the Small Blind.\n\nLooking at my current jokers:\n- Scholar is crucial for my Ace strategy\n- Hanging Chad is crucial for retriggering\n- Jolly Joker gives +8 mult for pairs (which Five of a Kind contains)\n- Green Joker gives minimal value (+1 mult currently)\n- Rocket gives money at end of round\n\n**Evaluating Shop Options:**\n\n1. **Crafty Joker** - Not useful since I'm not playing flushes. My strategy is Five of a Kind.\n\n2. **Arcana Pack** - Could provide useful tarot cards to enhance my deck/jokers. Possible cards could include:\n   - Cards to enhance Aces (like making them Gold, Glass, etc.)\n   - Cards to copy jokers\n   - Cards to add modifiers\n\n3. **Reroll Surplus** - $10 to reduce reroll cost by $2. With $41, this would leave me with $31 and future rerolls would cost $3 instead of $5. This could be valuable long-term.\n\n4. **Reroll** - $5 to see new options. With $41, this leaves me with $36.\n\nI'm halfway through the game at Ante 4/8, so I need to strengthen my deck for tougher blinds ahead. The Arcana Pack seems most promising since it could enhance my Aces or provide joker synergies, while Reroll Surplus offers long-term savings if I plan multiple rerolls. I should consider whether immediate upgrades or future flexibility matters more right now. Actually, looking at my joker lineup more carefully - Jolly Joker and Scholar are essential to my strategy, and Hanging Chad is critical for scoring. But Green Joker only gives +1 mult and loses value when I discard, while Rocket just generates money without helping my actual scoring. Those two seem replaceable. I should spend $5 to reroll and hunt for jokers that actually synergize with my Five of a Kind and Ace approach rather than keeping dead weight.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
