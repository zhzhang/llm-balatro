{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: TAROT_PACK\n- Current Money: $33\n- I have 5/5 jokers (FULL)\n- 0/2 consumables\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n5. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult)\n\n**Tarot Pack Options:**\n1. The Empress - Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n2. The Sun - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Hearts\n3. Temperance - Gives the total sell value of all current Jokers (Max of $50) (Currently $10)\n4. Judgement - Creates a random Joker card (Must have room) - CAN'T USE, JOKERS ARE FULL\n5. The Moon - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Clubs\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 8 of Spades\n2. 7 of Spades\n3. 6 of Spades\n4. 5 of Spades\n5. 3 of Spades\n6. Ace of Diamonds\n7. Jack of Diamonds\n8. 7 of Diamonds\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy strategy is based on pairs and two pairs, with:\n- Jolly Joker adding +8 mult to pairs\n- Hanging Chad retriggering the first card\n\n\n- Photograph doubling mult on the first face card played\n- Green Joker gaining mult each hand played\n\nI'm holding 5 spades and 3 diamonds. The Empress could permanently boost key cards like the Jack of Diamonds with +4 mult, which synergizes well with Photograph's x2 multiplier on face cards.\n\nThe Sun and The Moon both convert cards to different suits, but neither aligns with my current joker synergies since I'm not building around suit-based strategies. Temperance offers $10 but I need deck strength more than money at this ante level. Judgement is unusable since my joker slots are maxed out.\n\nThe Empress stands out as the clear winner—it permanently adds +4 mult to two cards. I should enhance the Jack of Diamonds since it's my only face card and will trigger Photograph's x2 mult alongside the enhancement bonus. The Ace of Diamonds makes sense as my second choice for a high-value card I'll play frequently. I'll go with The Empress and apply both enhancements there.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1,7,6]"}
