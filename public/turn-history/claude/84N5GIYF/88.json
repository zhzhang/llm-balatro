{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 4/8, Round 8, in the SHOP phase\n- Money: $34\n- Just acquired Mime joker from the booster pack\n\n**Current Jokers (5/5):**\n1. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card 2 additional times\n2. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, +$2 when Boss defeated\n3. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult\n4. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n5. Mime - Retrigger all card held in hand abilities\n\n**Shop Offerings:**\n- Half Joker: +20 Mult if played hand contains 3 or fewer cards ($5)\n- Ride the Bus: Gains +1 Mult per consecutive hand without face card ($6)\n- Jumbo Standard Pack: Choose 1 of up to 5 cards ($6)\n- Reroll Surplus voucher: Rerolls cost $2 less ($10)\n- Reroll cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my jokers:\n- Splash makes every played card count, so I typically want to play 5 cards\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the first card played\n- Scholar boosts Aces\n- Mime retriggers held-in-hand abilities (but I don't have many cards with those abilities yet)\n- Rocket provides end-of-round income\n\nThe shop offerings:\n1. **Half Joker** - This conflicts with my Splash strategy since I want to play 5 cards, not 3 or fewer. Not a good fit.\n\n2. **Ride the Bus** - This gains mult when I don't play face cards. Given that I have Scholar which boosts Aces (face card), and I play various hands, this seems inconsistent with my strategy.\n\n3. **Jumbo Standard Pack** - Could get me enhanced cards or specific cards I need. With Mime now, getting Steel cards would be good since they trigger when held in hand.\n\n\n4. **Reroll Surplus** - Reduces reroll cost from $5 to $3, saving money on future rerolls. This could be valuable for finding better jokers/cards. At Ante 4/8, I'm halfway through and need stronger synergies to handle tougher blinds ahead. The Jumbo Pack might help me find Steel cards to work with Mime's held-in-hand retriggering, while Reroll Surplus would give me more flexibility to hunt for better jokers later.\n\nI'm deciding between buying now, rerolling, or advancing. With $34 available, a reroll costs $5, leaving me $29 to shop again next round. Since none of these items directly synergize with Mime, spending $5 to see fresh options seems worth exploring before committing to a purchase.\n\nReroll Surplus is tempting for long-term value—$2 savings per reroll adds up if I plan multiple rerolls through the remaining rounds. But I need to prioritize immediate strength for the Boss Blind coming up. Let me reroll once and reassess based on what appears.\n\nActually, with $34 in hand, none of these options justify spending right now. I'll move forward and preserve my funds for a shop that offers something more impactful for my current build.","action":"\"round_select\""}
