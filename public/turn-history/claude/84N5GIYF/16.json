The best path forward is removing the Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds to maximize my chances of completing the Spade Flush.\\n\\nWith 9 Spades left in the remaining 39-card deck, the probability is reasonable. I'll discard the 5 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, and 7 of Diamonds, keeping my four Spades intact.\\n\\nBefore committing, though, I should verify the actual payout. A completed Flush nets 35 base chips plus the individual card values\\u2014if I draw a high Spade like a 10 or face card, the total could push closer to my 600-chip goal faster than I initially calculated.\\nCommand: discard 5 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 15]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Drunkard.

Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\\n6. 10 of Clubs (+10 chips)\\n7. 8 of Clubs (+8 chips)\\n8. 4 of Clubs (+4 chips)\\n\\n**Situation:**\\n- Need 600 chips total\\n- Have 4 hands and 3 discards remaining\\n- Boss effect: Discards 2 random cards per hand played (this happens from the deck, not from hand)\\n- Current chips: 0\\n\\n**What can I make:**\\n\\nLooking at the cards:\\n- Spades: Ace, 10, 8, 6 (4 cards)\\n- Clubs: Ace, 10, 8, 4 (4 cards)\\n\\nPairs:\\n- Ace of Spades and Ace of Clubs = Pair of Aces\\n- 10 of Spades and 10 of Clubs = Pair of 10s\\n- 8 of Spades and 8 of Clubs = Pair of 8s\\n\\nThis gives me THREE PAIRS! I can play:\\n1. Two Pair (any two of the three pairs)\\n2. Full House? No, I'd need three of a kind + a pair\\n\\nWait, I have three pairs but I can only play 5 cards. So I can play Two Pair with the best cards.\\n\\n**Option 1: Play a Flush**\\nI have 4 Spades, need 5 for a Flush. I could discard the Clubs and try to draw another Spade.\\n- Remaining Spades in deck: 9 cards out of 35 total\\n\\n\\n- Drawing 4 cards gives me a solid chance at hitting at least one Spade. I also have 4 Clubs available, though only 7 remain in the deck, making that a weaker option.\\n\\n**Option 2: Play Two Pair**\\nBest Two Pair would be Aces and 10s:\\n- Ace of Spades (+11)\\n- Ace of Clubs (+11)\\n- 10 of Spades (+10)\\n- 10 of Clubs (+10)\\n\\nBase chips for Two Pair: 20\\n\\nCard chips total 42, giving me 62 chips overall with a 2x multiplier\\u2014just 124 chips. That falls short of the ~150 per hand I need to reach 600 across all four hands.\\n\\n**Option 3: Keep trying for Flush**\\nMy previous Flushes scored 272 chips each, which is significantly better. If I can land 2-3 Flushes, I'll be well positioned. I should discard the Clubs and keep the Spades to draw a 5th Spade. With 9 Spades remaining in 35 cards, the odds are favorable. Alternatively, I could keep the Clubs since I have 4 of each suit, but Spades has more cards left in the deck (9 versus 7), making it the stronger choice. I can't form a Straight with my current ranks, so discarding the four Clubs and pursuing the Flush is my best option.\\nCommand: discard 5 6 7 8\\n\\n\\n[PREVIOUS STATE - Turn 16]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Drunkard.

This is perfect for a Flush!\\n- Ace of Spades (+11)\\n- Queen of Spades (+10)\\n- 10 of Spades (+10)\\n- 8 of Spades (+8)\\n- 7 of Spades (+7)\\n- 6 of Spades (+6)\\n\\n**Calculating Flush score:**\\nI should play 5 of the 6 Spades for a Flush. I want to maximize chip value, so I should play the 5 highest value Spades:\\n1. Ace of Spades (+11)\\n2. Queen of Spades (+10)\\n3. 10 of Spades (+10)\\n4. 8 of Spades (+8)\\n5. 7 of Spades (+7)\\n\\nBase chips for Flush: 35\\nCard chips: 11 + 10 + 10 + 8 + 7 = 46\\nTotal chips: 35 + 46 = 81\\nBase mult: 4\\nTotal score: 81 \\u00d7 4 = 324 chips\\n\\n\\nLet me verify this against the previous Flush hands that scored 272 chips. I need to double-check which cards actually contribute to the chip total\\u2014only the 5 cards in the Flush itself count toward the chip value, not the discarded ones.\\n\\nFor the Ace-Queen-10-8-7 of Spades combination, the card values sum to 46 chips. Combined with the 35 base chips for a Flush and multiplied by the 4x multiplier, that gives 324 chips total. Since I have 4 hands left and need 600 chips, scoring 324 twice would put me over the threshold. The boss mechanic discards cards from the deck rather than my hand, so it won't interfere with my current play. I'll go ahead and play this Flush.\\nCommand: play 1 2 3 4 5 flush 324\\n\\n[CURRENT STATE - Take action from this state]\\nAnte: 1/8, Round: 2\\nGame Step: SELECTING_HAND\\n## Inventory\\nOwned Jokers:\\n1: Name: Drunkard.

  "reasoning": "Let me analyze the current state:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 5 of Spades (+5 chips)\n3. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n4. Queen of Clubs (+10 chips)\n5. 9 of Clubs (+9 chips)\n6. 6 of Clubs (+6 chips)\n7. 3 of Clubs (+3 chips)\n8. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n\n**Situation:**\n- Need 600 chips total\n- Current chips: 324\n- Chips needed: 600 - 324 = 276 chips remaining\n- Hands remaining: 3\n- Discards remaining: 2\n- Boss effect: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\n\n**What can I make:**\n\nLooking at suits:\n- Spades: Jack, 5 (2 cards)\n- Hearts: 6 (1 card)\n- Clubs: Queen, 9, 6, 3 (4 cards)\n- Diamonds: King (1 card)\n\nI have 4 Clubs, so I'm one card away from a Flush.\n\nLooking at ranks:\n- 6 appears twice (6 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs)\n\n**Options:**\n\n**Option 1: Discard non-Clubs and try to draw a 5th Club**\nRemaining Clubs in deck: 3 cards out of 24 total\nIf I discard 4 cards (the 2 Spades, 1 Heart, 1 Diamond), I'd draw 4 new cards.\nProbability of getting at least 1 Club: 1 - (21/24 × 20/23 × 19/22 × 18/21) = 1 - 0.439 = 56.1%\n\nThat's moderate odds, but if I get a Flush with decent cards, it could score ~250+ chips depending on the card values.\n\n\nA Pair of 6s would only yield 44 chips (10 base + 12 from cards, doubled), which falls far short. Playing just the King as a High Card nets only 15 chips—both are inadequate given my deficit. I need to focus on the Flush strategy to accumulate the remaining 276 chips across my final three hands.\n\nSince my previous Flush generated 324 chips, landing another one would comfortably meet my target. The challenge is that I currently hold only 4 Clubs and need 5. With 3 Clubs still in the deck among 24 remaining cards and 2 discards left, I should discard my non-Club cards—the Jack of Spades, 5 of Spades, 6 of Hearts, and King of Diamonds—to maximize my chances of drawing that fifth Club."
