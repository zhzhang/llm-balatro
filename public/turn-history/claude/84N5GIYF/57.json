{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $39\n- I have 5/5 jokers (FULL)\n- 0/2 consumables\n- No tags or vouchers\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n5. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult)\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\nCards:\n1. Wrathful Joker - Played cards with Spade suit give +3 Mult when scored - $5\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Arcana Pack - Choose 1 of up to 5 Tarot cards to be used immediately - $6\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\nI just bought Green Joker and now my joker slots are full (5/5). Looking at my recent actions:\n- I upgraded Two Pair from Level 1 to Level 2 (now 40 chips, 3 mult)\n- I bought Green Joker for $4\n\nMy strategy has been centered around pairs and two pairs, with synergies from:\n- Jolly Joker giving +8 mult on pairs\n- Hanging Chad retriggering the first card\n- Photograph giving x2 mult on first face card\n- Green Joker scaling with hands played\n\n\n- With $39 left, I'm considering whether to invest in the Jumbo Arcana Pack for immediate tarot enhancements like Steel cards to boost chip scaling, or grab Reroll Surplus to drop future reroll costs from $5 to $3, which could provide long-term value.\n\n- I could also reroll the shop for $5 to hunt for better offerings, though my joker slots are already maxed out so I'd need to sell something first if I wanted Wrathful Joker.\n\n- Since I'm at Ante 4/8 with difficulty increasing and my pair/two pair strategy performing well (1,632 chips on two pairs last round), I should focus on what strengthens my current approach rather than pivoting entirely.\n\nThe Jumbo Arcana Pack appeals because it can enhance my existing cards through Steel cards for chip boosts and Mult/Bonus effects, leaving me with $33 for future shops. Given I'm at this critical midpoint, investing $6 now to improve my deck seems better than banking the money or gambling on a reroll.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
