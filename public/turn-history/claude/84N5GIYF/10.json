{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante 1/8, Shop phase\n- Money: $4\n- Owned Jokers: Drunkard (+1 discard per round)\n- Next blind: Boss Blind requiring 600 chips\n- I have leveled up Four of a Kind to Level 2 (90 chips, 10 mult)\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Loyalty Card - $5 - \"X4 Mult every 6 hands played, 5 remaining\"\n2. Reroll Surplus voucher - $10 - Rerolls cost $2 less\nCurrent Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI only have $4, so I cannot afford:\n- Loyalty Card ($5)\n- Reroll Surplus ($10)\n- Reroll shop ($5)\n\nLooking at my previous performance:\n- I've been playing Flushes successfully (272 chips each)\n- Two flushes = 544 chips\n- Boss Blind requires 600 chips\n\nI made a mistake by selecting Mars (Four of a Kind) instead of focusing on Flush. Four of a Kind is harder to construct than Flush, and I've been successful with Flushes.\n\nNow I have:\n- Four of a Kind at Level 2: 90 chips, 10 mult\n- Flush at Level 1: 35 chips, 4 mult\n- 4 hands and 4 discards available (3 base + 1 from Drunkard)\n\nLet me calculate what I can score:\n- If I play Four of a Kind: (90 + card chips) × 10 mult\n  - With 4 face cards (10 chips each): (90 + 40) × 10 = 1300 chips - WAY more than enough!\n  - Even with number cards, it should be around 500-800 chips per hand\n\n\n- If I play Flush: (35 + card chips) × 4 mult ≈ 272 chips\n\nWith 4 discards available, I should be able to construct at least one Four of a Kind hand, which would easily exceed the 600 chip requirement. The Loyalty Card won't help since it needs 6 hands to activate and I only have 4 in this blind. Since I can't afford anything in the shop anyway, I'll proceed to the blind and attempt to beat it.\n\nActually, let me check if selling the Drunkard Joker opens any options. That would give me $6 total, but even then I'd fall short of the Loyalty Card's $5 cost. With no other productive purchases available, I should just move forward and focus on constructing strong poker hands to clear this blind. should keep Drunkard for now. The immediate benefit of an extra discard to construct Four of a Kind hands outweighs a card that won't activate until future rounds. Since beating the Boss Blind is the priority, I need the flexibility Drunkard provides to find matching cards across my four available hands.","action":"\"round_select\""}
