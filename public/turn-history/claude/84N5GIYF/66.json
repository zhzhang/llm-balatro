{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7 (just beat Small Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $45\n- Max Jokers: 5 (currently have 5)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n4. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +1 Mult)\n5. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored (just bought)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards: Crafty Joker (+80 Chips if played hand contains a Flush) - $4\n- Boosters: Arcana Pack ($4), Celestial Pack ($4)\n- Vouchers: Reroll Surplus ($10)\n- Reroll Cost: $5\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nI just bought Scholar which synergizes perfectly with my Ace-heavy strategy and Hanging Chad. I played Five of a Kind with 5 Aces and scored 6,501 chips.\n\nLooking at my options:\n1. **Crafty Joker** - Not useful since I'm not playing flushes\n2. **Arcana Pack** - Could get useful tarot cards to enhance my deck\n3. **Celestial Pack** - Could level up Five of a Kind, which would be very valuable since that's my main hand\n4. **Reroll Surplus** - Expensive but could save money long-term\n5. **Reroll** - Could get better options for $5\n\nMy main hand is Five of a Kind, which is only Level 1 (120 base chips, 12 base mult). Leveling this up would significantly increase my scoring potential. A Celestial Pack could give me a planet card to level up Five of a Kind.\n\n\nWith $45 available, I should grab the Celestial Pack for $4 to level up Five of a Kind, my primary scoring hand. This pairs well with Scholar and Hanging Chad to maximize Ace plays. After that purchase I'd have $41 remaining to consider additional upgrades or save for future rounds.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [2]"}
