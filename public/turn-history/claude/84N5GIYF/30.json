{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 3 (just finished Small Blind)\n- In SHOP phase\n- Money: $6\n- Just sold Drunkard and Ice Cream jokers\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 mult for pairs (sells for $1)\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card 2 additional times (sells for $2)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Invisible Joker: $8 (need $2 more)\n- Jumbo Arcana Pack: $6 (can afford!)\n- Standard Pack: $4 (can afford)\n- Hone Voucher: $10 (need $4 more)\n- Reroll: $5 (can afford)\n\nBased on my previous reasoning, I've been working towards buying the Jumbo Arcana Pack. I sold Ice Cream and Drunkard specifically to get to $6 to afford it.\n\nThe Jumbo Arcana Pack offers powerful tarot cards that can enhance my playing cards, which will synergize extremely well with Hanging Chad's retriggering ability. For example:\n- The Devil creates Gold cards (+$3 when played, retriggered = +$9)\n- The Lovers creates Wild cards (can count as any suit)\n- The Magician creates Lucky cards (bonus chips/mult)\n- The Chariot creates Steel cards (x1.5 mult when stays in hand)\n\nThese enhancements become significantly more powerful when retriggered by Hanging Chad.\n\nI have exactly $6, which is the cost of the Jumbo Arcana Pack. This aligns with my previous strategy of selling jokers to get this pack.\n\nThe action should be: buy_booster 1","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
