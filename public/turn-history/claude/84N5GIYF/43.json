{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $8\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\nMax Jokers: 5 (I have 3, can buy 2 more)\n\n**Shop Options:**\n\nCards:\n1. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round, Payout increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated. Cost: $6\n2. Stuntman: +250 Chips, -2 hand size. Cost: $7\n\nBoosters:\n1. Jumbo Standard Pack: $6\n2. Standard Pack: $4\n\nVouchers:\n1. Planet Merchant: Planet cards appear 2X more frequently in the shop. Cost: $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nI'm now entering Ante 3, which means the chip requirements will increase significantly. Looking at my current setup:\n- My strategy has been focused on playing pairs, especially pairs with face cards\n- Jolly Joker gives +8 Mult for pairs\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card 2 times\n- Photograph gives X2 Mult for the first face card\n\nWith $8, I have limited options:\n1. Buy Rocket for $6 - This would give me passive income over time\n2. Buy Stuntman for $7 - This gives +250 chips but reduces hand size by 2, which could hurt my ability to find pairs\n3. Buy a booster pack - Jumbo Standard ($6) or Standard ($4)\n4. Reroll for $5\n5. Save money and move on\n\n\n6. The chip scaling ahead is steep, so I need to decide between immediate scoring power or long-term economy. Rocket provides steady cash flow but doesn't help this round. Stuntman offers a significant chip boost—250 is substantial—but shrinking my hand from 8 to 6 cards makes it harder to consistently hit pairs, which is my core engine.\n\nThe pack options let me potentially upgrade my deck with better cards, though I'm limited to 3-5 selections. Reroll gives me another chance at finding a better joker entirely. Since pairs have been carrying my runs, I'm leaning toward either protecting that strategy with a pack upgrade or taking the long view with Rocket's income growth.\n\nActually, the Stuntman's flat +250 chip boost is substantial enough to shift my thinking. Even if my hand shrinks to 6 cards, landing pairs consistently should still be feasible, and that bonus would dramatically amplify each pair I play. A pair of face cards with Hanging Chad's retrigger and Stuntman's bonus would easily exceed 300 chips—far stronger than what I'm currently generating.\n\nBut spending $7 leaves me with just $1, which severely constrains my options at future shops. Rocket costs $6 and preserves $2 in flexibility while providing compounding value through boss clears. Given that I'm already performing well and need to maintain adaptability for upcoming rounds, Rocket's long-term scaling seems like the safer, more sustainable choice.","action":"\"buy_card\"\nPositions: [1]"}
