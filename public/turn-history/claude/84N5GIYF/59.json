{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 6\n- Game Step: SHOP\n- Current Money: $33\n- I have 5/5 jokers (FULL)\n- 0/2 consumables\n- No tags or vouchers\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round, increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n5. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult)\n\n**Shop Inventory:**\nCards:\n1. Wrathful Joker - Played cards with Spade suit give +3 Mult when scored - $5\n\nBoosters: None\n\nVouchers:\n1. Reroll Surplus - Rerolls cost $2 less - $10\n\nReroll Cost: $5\n\n**Recent Actions:**\n- I just enhanced my Jack of Diamonds and Ace of Diamonds to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each) using The Empress\n- Before that, I bought Green Joker\n- Earlier I upgraded Two Pair to Level 2\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nI'm building around pairs and two pairs with:\n- Jolly Joker (+8 mult on pairs)\n- Hanging Chad (retrigger first card)\n- Photograph (x2 mult on first face card - now the enhanced Jack of Diamonds with +4 mult!)\n- Rocket (economy)\n- Green Joker (scaling with hands played)\n\nI just enhanced two cards with Mult enhancements, so my deck is stronger now.\n\n\nThe Wrathful Joker could synergize well since I typically play 5 spades, but my joker slots are maxed out. I'd need to sacrifice one of my current jokers to make room. Reroll Surplus would reduce future reroll costs to $3, which could help me find better shop options down the line. I could also just reroll now for $5 to see what else appears, or move forward to the next blind. and economy might matter. Wrathful Joker would give +6 mult on a pair of spades, which is solid but not as strong as Jolly Joker's +8. The real value comes if I'm playing multiple spades in a single hand—that's where it scales. Looking back at my hand composition, I had quite a few spades, so there's genuine synergy potential.\n\nReroll Surplus costs $10 and would drop me to $23, saving $2 per future reroll. That's tempting for long-term economy, but it's expensive right now when I need scoring power. Rerolling the shop itself might be the better move.\n\nAt this stage of the game, I'm better off preserving my current joker synergies and moving forward with my $33 intact rather than chasing marginal upgrades or expensive economy tools.","action":"\"round_select\""}
