{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In TAROT_PACK phase (must select from booster pack)\n- Current Money: $31\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 8 of Spades\n2. 7 of Spades\n3. Ace of Hearts (KEY CARD!)\n4. 10 of Hearts\n5. 7 of Hearts\n6. King of Clubs\n7. 4 of Clubs\n8. 9 of Diamonds\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. The Empress - Enhances 2 selected cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n2. The Sun - Converts up to 3 selected cards to Hearts\n3. Strength - Increases rank of up to 2 selected cards by 1\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nMy main strategy is Five of a Kind with 5 Aces. I currently have only ONE Ace in hand (Ace of Hearts).\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\n1. **The Empress** - Enhances 2 cards to Mult Cards (+4 Mult each)\n   - This would add +4 Mult to 2 cards when they score\n   - With Splash, all played cards count, so this could be useful\n   - But it doesn't help me get more Aces, which is my core need\n\n2. **The Sun** - Converts up to 3 cards to Hearts\n   - Changes suits rather than ranks, so it won't generate additional Aces\n   - Doesn't align with my Five of a Kind strategy\n\n3. **Strength** - Increases rank of up to 2 selected cards by 1\n   - This is particularly promising because I can upgrade my King of Clubs directly to an Ace\n   - I also have a 10 of Hearts that could become a Jack, and other cards with upgrade potential\n   - Looking at my hand, I have multiple high cards that could benefit from rank increases\n\nThe King of Clubs is my best target since converting it to an Ace would give me a second Ace, moving me closer to my Five of a Kind goal. I don't have Queens available to create additional Aces, so this single upgrade is my main opportunity with this card. Other options like upgrading the 10 of Hearts to a Jack are less valuable for my current strategy.\n\nThe Empress could boost multiplier on two cards, but that doesn't advance my rank-building approach. The Sun only shifts suits, which doesn't help either. Strength is clearly the strongest option since it directly supports my Five of a Kind plan by giving me that second Ace.\n\nI'll apply Strength to the King of Clubs in position 6 to create an Ace. For the second use, converting the 10 to a Jack doesn't meaningfully help my strategy, so I should focus the effect where it matters most.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [3,6]"}
