{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the BUFFOON_PACK phase, choosing from 2 joker cards\n- Money: $8\n- No jokers currently owned\n- I've disabled the Boss Blind effect by selling Luchador\n- Next is Boss Blind requiring 600 chips\n\n**Pack Choices:**\n1. Drunkard (Common) - \"+1 discard each round\"\n2. Diet Cola (Uncommon) - \"Sell this card to create a free Double Tag\" (doubles the next tag)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFor the Boss Blind:\n- I need 600 chips with 4 hands and 3 discards available\n- I've been playing Flushes successfully (272 chips each)\n- Two flushes = 544 chips, so I need about 56 more chips\n\n**Drunkard Analysis:**\n- Gives +1 discard per round\n- This would give me 4 discards instead of 3 in the Boss Blind\n- Extra discards help me find better hands, especially flushes\n- This is a consistent, reliable benefit\n- Directly helps me in the upcoming Boss Blind\n\n**Diet Cola Analysis:**\n- Needs to be sold to create a Double Tag\n- Double Tag copies the next tag I receive\n- This is more of a long-term investment\n- Doesn't help me immediately in the Boss Blind\n- Would only be useful if I get good tags later\n- Not immediately helpful for scoring chips\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe Boss Blind is immediate and requires 600 chips. I need something that helps me score more chips RIGHT NOW.\n\nDrunkard gives me an extra discard, which means I can:\n- Have more chances to find the cards I need for flushes\n- Be more selective about which cards to keep\n- Have 4 discards instead of 3 in the Boss Blind\n\nDiet Cola doesn't help me score chips directly - it's a tag economy card that requires selling to get value, and I wouldn't even get immediate benefit since I don't have any tags right now.\n\n\nSince I'm facing the Boss Blind immediately and need to hit 600 chips, the extra discard from Drunkard directly supports my flush strategy by giving me more opportunities to assemble the right cards. Diet Cola's tag-doubling effect is too delayed to help with my current challenge.\n\n**Conclusion: Select Drunkard (position 1)**","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
