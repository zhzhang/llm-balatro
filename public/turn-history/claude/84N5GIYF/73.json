{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- In SHOP phase\n- Current Money: $31\n- Just used Strength to upgrade King to Ace (now have 2 Aces)\n\n**My Jokers (5/5 slots - FULL):**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\n**Shop Options:**\n- Cards: The High Priestess (Creates up to 2 random Planet cards) - $3\n- Boosters: None\n- Vouchers: Reroll Surplus ($10)\n- Reroll Cost: $6\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy goal is to build a Five of a Kind with 5 Aces. I now have 2 Aces after using Strength. I need to get 3 more Aces.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\n1. **The High Priestess ($3)** - Creates up to 2 random Planet cards\n   - Could potentially get Five of a Kind planets to level it up\n   - But it's random - might not get the hand I want\n   - I have 2 consumable slots available\n   - Would cost $3, leaving me with $28\n\n2. **Reroll Surplus ($10)** - Reduces reroll cost by $2\n   - Would make future rerolls $4 instead of $6\n   - Long-term value but expensive\n   - Would leave me with $21\n\n3. **Reroll ($6)** - See new shop options\n   - Could find more useful cards/jokers\n   - Would leave me with $25\n\n4. **Round Select** - Move on to next blind\n   - I'm at Round 7 of Ante 4\n   - Next is the Big Blind\n\nThe High Priestess won't directly help me get more Aces since it only creates planet cards. Reroll Surplus is valuable long-term but costs a lot upfront. I should probably reroll to search for Strength cards or other jokers that could accelerate my Ace-building strategy. I'm still early enough in the run that finding better options now could pay off significantly.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I've already cleared the Small Blind and the Big Blind is coming up, followed by the Boss Blind for this ante. With my current deck—two Aces, Scholar, Hanging Chad, Splash, and Jolly Joker—I have solid scoring potential. The real question is whether I can push my Five of a Kind plan further. Since I can reroll for $6 and still maintain $25, that's worth exploring to see if anything better surfaces.","action":"\"reroll_shop\""}
