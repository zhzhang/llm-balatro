{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in the Shop phase after beating the Big Blind\n- Money: $12\n- No jokers currently owned\n- I just sold Luchador, which should have disabled the Boss Blind effect\n- Next is the Boss Blind requiring 600 chips\n\n**Shop Contents:**\n1. Loyalty Card - $5 - \"X4 Mult every 6 hands played, 5 remaining\"\n2. Buffoon Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 2 Joker cards\n3. Celestial Pack - $4 - Choose 1 of up to 3 Planet cards\n4. Reroll Surplus voucher - $10 - Rerolls cost $2 less\n\n**What I Need:**\nThe Boss Blind requires 600 chips. I've been playing Flushes successfully (272 chips each). Without the Boss's discard effect (which I disabled by selling Luchador), I should be able to form hands more reliably.\n\nWith 4 hands available in the Boss Blind:\n- Two Flushes = 544 chips (not enough)\n- I need around 56 more chips from remaining hands\n\n**Best Strategy:**\n1. Buy Buffoon Pack ($4) - Get a scoring joker that will help me reach 600 chips\n2. Buy Celestial Pack ($4) - Level up Flush to make it stronger\n3. This leaves me with $4\n\nThe Loyalty Card won't work because it needs 6 hands played, but Boss Blind only gives 4 hands. So I have 5 hands remaining before it triggers, meaning it won't activate in the Boss Blind.\n\nActually, let me recalculate if I should buy both packs:\n- Buffoon Pack: $4 (gives me a joker)\n- Celestial Pack: $4 (levels up a hand type)\n- Total: $8, leaving me with $4\n\n\nCombining the Buffoon Pack with a Celestial Pack upgrade gives me both immediate joker scoring power and strengthened Flush hands, which is more valuable than the Loyalty Card since that won't trigger during the Boss Blind anyway. I'll grab the Buffoon Pack first.","action":"\"buy_booster\"\nPositions: [1]"}
