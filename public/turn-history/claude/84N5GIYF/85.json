{"reasoning":"Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\nI'm in a BUFFOON_PACK phase, where I need to choose between two jokers:\n\n1. **Mime** (Uncommon) - Retrigger all card held in hand abilities\n2. **Driver's License** (Rare) - X3 Mult if you have at least 16 Enhanced cards in your full deck (Currently 2)\n\nCurrent Jokers:\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n4. Scholar - Played Aces give +20 Chips and +4 Mult when scored\n5. Splash - Every played card counts in scoring\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Mime:**\n- Retriggers all cards held in hand\n- This could synergize with Splash, which makes all played cards count\n- However, \"held in hand\" typically refers to cards NOT played\n- Could work with Steel cards (which trigger when held)\n- With Splash, I usually play 5 cards, leaving 3 in hand\n- This could be powerful if I have cards with \"held in hand\" abilities\n\n**Driver's License:**\n- X3 Mult if I have at least 16 Enhanced cards\n- Currently only have 2 enhanced cards\n- Would need 14 more enhanced cards to activate\n- This is a long-term investment that would require significant resources to activate\n- At Ante 4/8, I may not have time/resources to get 16 enhanced cards\n\nGiven my current strategy:\n- I rely heavily on Splash to make all played cards count\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card\n- Scholar boosts Aces significantly\n\n**Mime Analysis:**\nMime retriggers \"held in hand\" abilities. Let me think about what this means:\n\n\nSteel cards and certain jokers trigger when held, so Mime would amplify those effects. With Splash active, I'd play 5 cards and keep 3 in hand—if those remaining cards have \"held in hand\" abilities, Mime multiplies their impact. The issue is I lack cards with such abilities currently, though this could develop into strong synergy later.\n\n**Driver's License Analysis:**\nReaching 16 enhanced cards requires substantial investment—either multiple tarot cards or shop purchases—which seems unrealistic given my current position at Ante 4/8.\n\n**Decision:**\nMime appears more viable since it offers flexibility and potential growth, whereas Driver's License demands too much setup. But I'm already at capacity with 5 jokers, so I'd need to sacrifice something. Evaluating what to potentially remove: Jolly Joker provides modest mult, Hanging Chad and Scholar are both strong multipliers, Rocket generates money rather than scoring, and Splash enables my hand strategy.\n\nIf I add Mime, Jolly Joker would be the logical candidate to sell given its weaker contribution. Though Mime's retrigger effect on held cards feels limited without specific synergies. I should also consider whether skipping this pack entirely makes sense—I could preserve my current setup and wait for better opportunities. Since neither option clearly improves my position and Driver's License requires too much investment, taking Mime offers more upside than Driver's License while still leaving room to reassess.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [1]"}
