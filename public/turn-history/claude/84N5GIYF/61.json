{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 4/8, Round: 7\n- Game Step: SELECTING_HAND\n- Current Blind: Small Blind - need 5000 chips\n- Current Money: $33\n- Hands remaining: 4\n- Discards remaining: 4\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**My Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 9 of Spades (+9 chips)\n3. Ace of Hearts (+11 chips)\n4. 10 of Hearts (+10 chips)\n5. Ace of Clubs (+11 chips)\n6. 5 of Clubs (+5 chips)\n7. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips, +4 Mult) - Enhanced Mult Card\n8. 4 of Diamonds (+4 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker - +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad - Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket - Earn $3 at end of round\n5. Green Joker - +1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard (Currently +0 Mult)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have FOUR ACES! This is a Four of a Kind hand, which is very strong.\n- Ace of Spades\n- Ace of Hearts\n- Ace of Clubs\n- Ace of Diamonds (enhanced with +4 Mult)\n\n**Scoring Calculation for Four of a Kind:**\n\nFour of a Kind (Level 2):\n- Base chips: 90\n- Base mult: 10\n\nCards played: 4 Aces\n- Each Ace adds +11 chips = 44 chips\n\n\n- The Ace of Diamonds contributes an additional +4 mult\n- Total base chips: 90 + 44 = 134 chips\n\nJoker effects to consider:\n- Jolly Joker won't trigger since Four of a Kind isn't a Pair\n- Hanging Chad will retrigger my first played card twice, multiplying its contribution\n- Photograph doesn't apply without face cards\n- Rocket has no scoring impact\n- Green Joker adds +1 Mult to the final calculation\n\nI need to determine the proper sequence of how these effects stack together.\n\n1. Boss Blind effects apply first\n2. Green Joker gains +1 mult after this hand resolves, but starts at +0 for current scoring\n3. Cards score sequentially from left to right, with Hanging Chad retriggering the initial card twice\n   - Ace of Spades: +11 chips and triggers Hanging Chad\n   - Ace of Hearts: +11 chips\n   - Ace of Clubs: +11 chips\n   - Ace of Diamonds: +11 chips plus +4 mult\n\nI should recalculate the exact scoring by working through the card order carefully, starting with the Ace of Spades triggering the retrigger effect. round. It gains +1 per hand played, so it should contribute to the multiplier.\n\nLooking at the activation sequence, 'Independent' Jokers trigger left-to-right, which means Green Joker applies here at its current +0 value, then advances to +1 for the next hand.\n\nSo the final score is 156 chips × 14 mult = 2,184 chips. That falls short of the 5000 chip target, so I need to explore other options. With four Aces available, I could play them as a Four of a Kind for a stronger score, or use a pair instead to activate Jolly Joker differently.\n\nTesting a pair of Aces gives me 10 base chips plus retriggered Ace values and Jolly Joker's +8 mult bonus, totaling only 756 chips—worse than the full hand. I should reconsider my previous successful hands, particularly that Pair which scored 1,200 chips.\n\nI realize Photograph provides a multiplicative X2 bonus for the first face card scored, not additive. Since I only have Aces (not face cards like Jacks, Queens, or Kings), this doesn't help my current setup. The enhanced Jack of Diamonds I created earlier isn't even in my hand right now, so I'm missing a key scoring opportunity. I should explore discarding to find better cards or reconsider which enhancements actually benefit my available cards.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,4,6,8]"}
