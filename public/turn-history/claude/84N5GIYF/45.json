{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current game state:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 5\n- Game Step: BLIND_SELECT\n- Current Money: $2\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round, Payout increases by $2 when Boss Blind is defeated\n\n**Blind Options:**\n\n**Small Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 2000\n- Reward: $3\n- Tag for skipping: Investment Tag (gain $25 after defeating Boss Blind)\n\n**Big Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 3000\n- Reward: $4\n- Tag for skipping: Handy Tag (Gives $1 per played hand this run - will give $10)\n\n**Boss Blind:**\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Boss Description: All Club cards are debuffed\n- Reward: $5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent scoring history:\n- Pairs have been scoring between 380-1,300 chips\n- My best pair scored 1,200 chips\n- Two pairs scored 620 chips\n\nFor the Small Blind (2000 chips), I would need to play multiple hands. Based on my past performance:\n- If I average around 500 chips per pair, I'd need 4 hands\n- I typically have 3-4 hands per round\n\nThis is doable but might be tight. However, the Investment Tag offers $25 after defeating the Boss Blind, which is HUGE value - that's essentially 5 shop purchases worth of money.\n\nFor the Big Blind (3000 chips), I'd need even more hands or bigger scores. \n\nThe Handy Tag would give me $10 based on my current hand count, but that's less impactful than the Investment Tag's $25. For the Boss Blind, the Club debuff could hurt depending on my draw, though I have cards across all suits. The real question is whether I can reliably beat the Boss Blind to unlock that Investment Tag value - skipping the Small Blind gets me closer to that goal, but I need to ensure I have enough chip generation to handle both the Big and Boss Blinds. so I should still be able to find pairs from other suits. The Investment Tag's $25 payout after beating the boss outweighs the immediate $3 from Small Blind, especially since Rocket generates ongoing income that increases post-boss. Skipping Small Blind nets me the tag, then I earn $5 from Big Blind (including Rocket's $1), and finally $33 from the Boss Blind round ($8 earnings plus the $25 tag bonus), totaling $40 versus the $6 I'd get from playing Small Blind first.","action":"\"skip_round\""}
