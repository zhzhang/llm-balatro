{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Boss Blind: All Club cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 600\n- Remaining hands: 3\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $12\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. 7 of Spades (+7 chips)\n2. 4 of Spades (+4 chips)\n3. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n4. Ace of Clubs (Debuffed - no chips, no abilities)\n5. 6 of Clubs (Debuffed - no chips, no abilities)\n6. Ace of Diamonds (+11 chips)\n7. King of Diamonds (+10 chips)\n8. 2 of Diamonds (+2 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round\n\n**What I need:**\n- I need 4000 - 600 = 3400 more chips\n- I have 3 hands remaining\n- I need to average about 1133 chips per hand\n\n**Analyzing my current hand:**\nLooking at the cards:\n- I don't have any pairs\n- I have two Aces (Ace of Clubs is debuffed, Ace of Diamonds is active)\n- I have a King of Diamonds (face card)\n- No flush potential (4 Diamonds, 2 Spades, 1 Heart, 2 Clubs)\n- No straight potential\n\nMy best options seem to be:\n1. Discard some cards to try to draw pairs or better hands\n\n\n2. Play a high card hand with the King of Diamonds leading to trigger Photograph\n\nIf I lead with the King of Diamonds, I'd get the base high card value of 5 chips plus 1 mult, then add the King's 10 chips. Hanging Chad would retrigger it twice more for an additional 20 chips. With Photograph doubling the multiplier on that face card, I'd end up with 35 chips total and 2x multiplier applied.\n\nThat gives me only 70 chips—clearly not enough. I need to discard and hunt for better cards. The two Club cards are completely dead weight due to the debuff, and the low cards like the 4 of Spades, 3 of Hearts, and 2 of Diamonds won't contribute much. I should hold onto the Ace of Diamonds, King of Diamonds, and 7 of Spades while discarding the weak cards to draw pairs or additional face cards that synergize better with my jokers.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [2,3,4,5,8]"}
