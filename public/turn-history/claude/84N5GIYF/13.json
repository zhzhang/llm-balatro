{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current state carefully:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Ace of Spades (+11 chips)\n2. 10 of Spades (+10 chips)\n3. 8 of Spades (+8 chips)\n4. 6 of Spades (+6 chips)\n5. 5 of Hearts (+5 chips)\n6. Jack of Clubs (+10 chips)\n7. 7 of Clubs (+7 chips)\n8. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n\n**Situation:**\n- Need 600 chips total\n- Have 4 hands and 4 discards remaining\n- Boss effect: Discards 2 random cards per hand played\n- Current chips: 0\n\n**What I can make:**\n- I have 4 Spades: Ace, 10, 8, 6\n- I need 5 cards of the same suit for a Flush\n- I have a pair of 7s (7 of Clubs and 7 of Diamonds)\n\n**Options:**\n\n1. **Play a Flush with 4 Spades + another Spade:**\n   - I currently have 4 Spades, but I need 5 for a Flush\n   - I cannot play a Flush right now\n\n2. **Discard to try and get a 5th Spade:**\n   - Remaining Spades in deck: 9 cards out of 39 total\n   - Probability of getting at least 1 Spade in 4 draws: ~69%\n   - This is risky but could work\n\n3. **Play the pair of 7s:**\n   - Base chips: 10\n   - Card chips: 7 + 7 = 14\n   - Total chips: 24\n   - Mult: 2\n   - Total: 24 × 2 = 48 chips\n   - This is terrible, way too low\n   \n4. **Discard the non-Spade cards to hunt for a fifth Spade or build stronger combinations.** Since I've already hit Flushes worth 272 chips each, and I need 600 total, landing 2-3 more Flushes would exceed my target. The best path forward is removing the Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds to maximize my chances of completing the Spade Flush.\n\nWith 9 Spades left in the remaining 39-card deck, the probability is reasonable. I'll discard the 5 of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, and 7 of Diamonds, keeping my four Spades intact.\n\nBefore committing, though, I should verify the actual payout. A completed Flush nets 35 base chips plus the individual card values—if I draw a high Spade like a 10 or face card, the total could push closer to my 600-chip goal faster than I initially calculated.","action":"\"discard\"\nPositions: [5,6,7,8]"}
