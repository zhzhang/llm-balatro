{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation carefully.\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante: 3/8, Round: 6\n- Boss Blind: All Club cards are debuffed\n- Chips Needed: 4000\n- Current Chips: 0\n- Remaining hands: 4\n- Remaining discards: 3\n- Current Money: $12\n\n**Current Hand:**\n1. Jack of Spades (+10 chips)\n2. 7 of Hearts (+7 chips)\n3. 6 of Hearts (+6 chips)\n4. 3 of Hearts (+3 chips)\n5. Ace of Clubs (Debuffed - no chips, no abilities)\n6. 6 of Clubs (Debuffed - no chips, no abilities)\n7. 7 of Diamonds (+7 chips)\n8. 6 of Diamonds (+6 chips)\n\n**My Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n3. Photograph: First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n4. Rocket: Earn $1 at end of round\n\n**Possible Hands:**\n- Three of a kind (6s): 6H, 6C, 6D - but 6C is debuffed\n- Pair of 7s: 7H and 7D\n- Pair of 6s: 6H and 6D (the 6C is debuffed)\n\nLet me analyze the best play option:\n\n**Option 1: Play pair of 7s with Jack of Spades as first card**\n\nIf I play: Jack of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 7 of Diamonds\n\nBase pair: 10 chips + 2 mult\n- Jack of Spades: +10 chips\n\n\n- Hanging Chad doubles this with 2 retriggered plays: +20 additional chips\n- Photograph activates on the Jack: X2 mult multiplier\n- 7 of Hearts: +7 chips\n- 7 of Diamonds: +7 chips\n\nThis gives me 54 total chips (10 base + 10 Jack + 20 retriggered + 7 + 7) with a 10x multiplier (2 base + 8 from Jolly Joker), then doubled to 20x from Photograph.\n\nFinal score: 54 × 20 = 1,080 chips\n\nNow considering a different approach with two pair instead. Playing Jack of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 7 of Diamonds, 6 of Hearts, 6 of Diamonds gives me a two pair base of 20 chips and 2 mult. The Jack triggers Hanging Chad twice for +30 chips total, while the paired sevens and sixes each contribute their face values. This setup reaches 56 chips before multipliers are applied.\n\nThe two pair hand type activates Jolly Joker for 8 additional mult, bringing me to 10 mult total. With Photograph doubling that to 20 mult, the final calculation is 76 × 20 = 1,520 chips.\n\nBut I need to reconsider the debuff mechanic. The boss debuffs all Club cards, which includes the 6 of Clubs. While debuffed cards lose their chip values and abilities, they still count toward hand formation. So the 6 of Clubs can still combine with the other 6s to form a three of a kind, even though it won't contribute any chips itself.\n\nIf I instead play three of a kind with the Jack of Spades, 6 of Hearts, 6 of Clubs, and 6 of Diamonds, I get a base of 30 chips plus 3 mult. The Jack adds 30 chips (accounting for Photograph's doubling effect), the Hearts 6 adds 6 chips, the Clubs 6 adds nothing due to the debuff, and the Diamonds 6 adds 6 chips, totaling 72 chips with just 3 mult—significantly worse than the two pair option.\n\nSince I have 4 hands remaining and need 4000 chips total, averaging around 1000 per hand, the two pair play generating approximately 1,520 chips would put me well ahead of pace.","action":"\"play\"\nPositions: [1,2,7,3,8]"}
