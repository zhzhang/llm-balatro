{"reasoning":"Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- Ante 2/8, Round 4\n- Game Step: BUFFOON_PACK\n- Current Money: $1\n- I need to choose 1 of 2 jokers from the Buffoon Pack\n\n**My Current Jokers:**\n1. Jolly Joker: +8 Mult if played hand contains a Pair\n2. Hanging Chad: Retrigger first played card used in scoring 2 additional times\n\n**Booster Pack Choices:**\n1. Marble Joker - Adds one Stone card to deck when Blind is selected. Stone cards give +50 Chips with no rank or suit. Rarity: Uncommon\n2. Photograph - First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored. Rarity: Common\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my recent play history:\n- I've been playing mostly pairs (3 pairs in the last round alone)\n- Jolly Joker synergizes well with pairs (+8 Mult)\n- Hanging Chad retriggers the first played card 2 additional times\n\nLet me evaluate both options:\n\n**Marble Joker:**\n- Adds a Stone card to my deck each blind\n- Stone cards give +50 Chips but have no rank or suit\n- This could interfere with my pair strategy since Stone cards can't form pairs (they have no rank)\n- However, the +50 chips could be useful\n- Stone cards can still be played for their chip value\n- But they would dilute my deck and make it harder to find pairs\n\n**Photograph:**\n- First played face card gives X2 Mult when scored\n- Face cards are Jack, Queen, King\n- This would synergize with Hanging Chad - if I play a face card first, it gets retriggered 2 times AND gives X2 Mult\n- This works well with pairs if one of the pair cards is a face card\n- X2 Mult is a multiplicative bonus, which is very powerful\n\n\n- Playing a face card pair with this setup creates strong synergy: the face card triggers Hanging Chad's retrigger effect while also gaining X2 Mult, and the pair itself activates Jolly Joker's bonus. This combination is far more powerful than adding diluting Stone cards to my deck.\n\nI'll take Photograph.","action":"\"select\"\nPositions: [2]"}
